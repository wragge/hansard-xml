<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The report that I have just tabled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women, elections and parliament</EMPHASIS>, relates to a reference from the Senate proposing that the committee conduct an inquiry to discover the reasons for the gender imbalance in Australian parliaments, develop strategies for reducing the imbalance and identify the aspects of parliamentary procedures and practices which impede the full participation of Australian women in Australian political life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself is short. It reflects the committee's conclusion that a conventional parliamentary committee inquiry would not be the best way for this committee to participate in the debate about ways to improve the representation of women in parliaments in Australia. The committee was assisted in reaching this conclusion by a paper prepared for it by Ms Consie Larmour of the social policy research group of the legislative research service of the parliamentary library. Ms Larmour's paper has been included as part of our report as the appendix. The committee regards this paper as accurately stating the present situation with regard to the matters raised by the terms of reference for the inquiry. It is the intention of the committee to make the paper widely available and invite comments on it from the community. This will assist the monitoring process which the committee recommends for itself in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As regards the first of the proposed terms of reference&mdash;namely, the reasons for the gender imbalance&mdash;it was apparent to the committee from Ms Larmour's paper that the existing research had already established many of the reasons for the imbalance of men and women in Australian parliaments. It was the same with the second proposed term of reference, which asked the committee to consider strategies for increasing the number and effectiveness of women in political and electoral processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The goal of achieving parity in representation had been accepted not only by Australian parliamentarians and political parties but by the international parliamentary community as represented by the Inter-Parliamentary Union. The report and appendix describe current ideas and strategies for achieving this aim. The committee felt that matters had moved beyond the point of proposing strategies. These had already been identified and were now being implemented as actual programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within my own party there has been a recognition over the years that women are under-represented in the political process at all levels. We have accepted that something must be done. At the recent seventh National Labor Women's Conference, women within the ALP enunciated their strategies for achieving just representation. These strategies have been developed over a period and are based on the goal of 50 per cent by 2000. The increased participation of women within the ALP at all levels, particularly in parliament, has the support of the massive majority of ALP members, voters and the community. I fully support affirmative action becoming a part of our preselection process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those opposite do not have too many on their benches. The committee has concluded that the most valuable role it can perform in light of this ongoing activity is to monitor developments on behalf of the parliament so far as they relate to the electoral process. Accordingly, it recommends in the report that the Minister for Administrative Services authorise the committee under paragraph (1) of its resolution of appointment to monitor developments in the area of the participation by women in the electoral process and to report on this matter from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This monitoring role is important because it will enable the committee to continue its involvement with this issue. I hope that all participants in the political process will assist the committee in carrying out this function. Indeed, the debate and interest that will follow this report will enable us to see whether the parties are succeeding in any programs to support the increased participation of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did not consider that it was authorised to conduct an inquiry on the third of the terms of reference, namely, the effect of parliamentary procedures on women's participation. The report notes recent developments involving the introduction of new sitting hours for the Senate and the House that are more conducive to family life than the traditional hours. However, matters of parliamentary procedure and practice are outside the scope of the authority conferred on the committee by the parliament and should be undertaken by the respective procedure committees of the Senate and the House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of the committee to distribute the parliamentary research service paper among community groups, inviting comments and responses from within these communities. To this end the research service paper has been printed as part of the report that I have just tabled. I welcome the debate that will follow the tabling of this report and encourage all interested people to tell the committee what they think about the issues and the findings of the report. I also welcome the ongoing monitoring role that the committee has committed itself to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank Consie Larmour, Margaret Healy and Shelley McInnis for their significant contributions to the report by way of research papers. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, I support the motion to take note of this report and commend the report to the Senate. I join with Senator Foreman in thanking the parliamentary library's research service for all the work its people did in making this a very valuable document. It is a useful publication. It brings together all the available research on this very important topic and will have a life of its own, as a document out in the community, and as a very useful resource for everybody interested in this very significant topic. It is a good overview of the current situation and therefore very important.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also useful to note that this is a bipartisan report. The Labor, Liberal, Democrat and Green members of this joint standing committee have all agreed on this report; so it comes to the Senate, the parliament and the people with the support of all the major parties. I also commend the recommendation that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters have an ongoing monitoring and coordinating role in this area so that we can monitor developments and disseminate ideas for increasing the opportunities for women to enter parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has become something of a motherhood statement, but it is true that on all sides of the parliament there is a genuine commitment to seeing more women participate in political life, particularly in our parliaments. They do have a very important contribution to make and bring qualities to parliamentary life that are different and distinct from those which males can contribute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be noted that an enormous amount of progress has been made in this area. There are a lot more women in parliament than was the case not that long ago. I am proud that a quarter of the members representing South Australia in the House of Representatives on the Liberal side are women, with Trish Worth and Chris Gallus joining the parliament and making an excellent contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real issue at stake is how do we achieve the objective that we all share: how do we increase the numbers of women in our parliaments? I note Senator Foreman's personal commitment to affirmative action. But it is really a choice between what I describe as an evolutionary process and the alternative, which in fact is a revolutionary approach. I have to say that affirmative action, which really means quotas, is entering into what I call a revolutionary approach to this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say here firmly that I favour an evolution in this issue. I think that moving to a revolutionary approach of quotas is quite wrong and quite dangerous. What we have to focus on in what I call the evolutionary approach is to remove the barriers that have been there&mdash;and perhaps still exist&mdash;to women entering parliament. I would like to think of it as adopting a supply-side approach to this very important issue and not adopting an approach of ordaining outcomes, which I think is dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to make parliamentary life more attractive to women. That has been a great barrier to the entry of women into parliament. There is a great deal to be done by both parties to encourage women to seek preselection in the first place, because that is a major element in the process. Most important of all, in my view, is that it is absolutely essential that selection of people by the political parties for parliament continues to be based on merit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any departure from that principle will set back the cause of women immeasurably. I think it would be highly dangerous for the ALP to embark on the course it has suggested of affirmative action. I am pleased that on our side of politics there is no dispute and no debate about this. We continue to be committed to selection based on merit and to giving women equal opportunity to seek preselection, to seek a role in parliament. Therefore, I do reject the revolutionary approach being suggested within the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think all of us should be concerned by moves in the ALP for quotas. It is interesting for us on this side to note that we now have a major brawl in the ALP, which has flared in particular in Queensland, with everybody fighting each other on this issue. I join with Premier Wayne Goss in his rejection of affirmative action, that is, quotas. I note that recently he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that all voters&mdash;and women voters are included in that&mdash;want the best possible member to represent them. And I think we've seen in a number of cases good women members of parliament elected for that reason, because they're a good member of parliament, not simply because they're a woman.</PARA>
<PARA>Unusual as it may be for us to endorse the comments of ALP members, I totally endorse everything that Labor Premier Wayne Goss has said and I hope that the ALP will take careful note of what its only Labor premier is saying on this very important issue, because I do think that the alternative approach will set back the cause.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quotas are wrong. They are really not the approach which a free society should adopt. Essentially, they involve tokenism at its worst.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the women on our side of politics can say without any reservation that they are there on merit. Once we adopt a quota system, that can no longer be said and I think such a system would be very bad for Australian politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone who has lived in the United States and experienced the consequences of the adoption of quotas for race would understand the great concern and the great problems that are caused by such an approach&mdash;in many cases this has actually set back the cause of black Americans&mdash;and would be concerned about the adoption of such an approach in relation to females in parliament. This inevitably sets up the problem of demands for quotas for other groups. Are we then going to see demands for quotas in the parliament for people of different racial backgrounds, different geography, different types, different handicaps? A never-ending chain of events would be set off by the demand for or implementation of quotas for women in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, we should keep very much in mind the principle of merit and we should also bear in mind what qualities are required and demanded in our members of parliament. In my view, those qualities are based on a person's character. We should be focussing on the character of our members of parliament and not their gender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What should concern all political parties in the selection of the people they put forward for parliamentary office are character issues, not gender issues. We should be talking about the integrity of the people we select for parliament. We should be talking about their honesty, their moral values, their objectivity, their spirit of public service and their sense of conviction&mdash;their conviction about the principles that they believe in, whether of the left or the right. But it is their character that is important and not their gender. I fear that going down the track of quotas will bring gender to a point where it overrides the essential principles of merit and character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I think it is heartening that this excellent report has been presented as a bipartisan report. The report has avoided the question of whether there should or should not be affirmative action&mdash;that is a matter for the political parties themselves to debate. I take pleasure in supporting this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take some pleasure in welcoming this report and acknowledge that it has cross-party support. It has generated some useful debate among the members of the committee and among the members and senators from the major parties. However, I feel some degree of disappointment about the way this reference has been received by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and the way in which it has been handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that this is the case, not simply because I was the person who moved the motion in the Senate&mdash;which the Senate accepted and then referred it to the committee&mdash;but more because I am a woman, and a woman in parliament. I feel that this reference could have been dealt with in a more serious and comprehensive way than it has been. The report itself is extremely brief, and it basically presents the position as discussed by the chairman of the committee, Senator Foreman, and one of the members, Senator Minchin, who spoke prior to me. But I will not go over that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than simply producing this report, the committee could have taken up the reference, embraced it and opened it up for community consultations, which would have been valuable if done in conjunction with the committee hearings that were held on the major reference of this committee which examines  the conduct of each federal election. It would have been a very valuable time to actually seek information from women in the community as to their responses to the representation of women in the electoral system as a whole and in parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one point, in a technically accurate manner, the committee points out that it does not believe that this issue is a matter for reference to this committee. I stress that technically that is correct as the committee members did not believe that it was appropriate to refer matters of parliament to the committee on electoral matters. Nevertheless, I believe that it would have been a very useful reference had the committee taken that role more seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that there is no other committee dealing with this matter. However, as one of two women on a fairly large committee I was relatively unsupported in pursuing a more detailed hearing process and a more detailed look at the Senate reference. In the absence of political will I think there is no point in having a committee look at a matter of such serious import if it is not prepared to take it seriously and look at policy and new directions. If it simply means that party positions have to be supported and followed, then there is little purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, that is why this is a unanimous report of the committee. The content is not necessarily unanimous, but the fact is that it may well be all that this committee is capable of doing with its existing constituency. If the representation of men and women on that committee were reversed so that there were, for example, two men on the committee, I am sure that a more thorough job would have been done with the reference. I can but only remark on that in passing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially we have a great problem with representation in our parliament. If we talk about a representative democracy, there is no doubt that we have a maldistribution. To talk about representation by merit really skirts the issue. There is an inherent flaw in a democracy when 50 per cent of the population&mdash;whatever that definition is, whether gender or something else&mdash;is unrepresented through its parliamentary representatives. That is the reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the history of women's representation in federal parliament from 1943 to the present, I have seen a graph which shows that it has never risen above 23 per cent in the Senate and never above eight per cent in the House of Representatives. Honourable senators will be interested to know when we look at gradients that the House of Representatives is actually increasing its representation of women, and that it has been doing so since 1977. But the Senate has actually been decreasing its representation of women, so the 21 per cent we have at the moment is less than what we had at the 1990 election and even lower than our 1987 election result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an ineffective representational position within our parliamentary system in Australia. How we deal with it poses a dilemma. I think it is a complex question, so it is to be valued when the major parties look at it and have their own distinctive ways of addressing it. I point out that the Greens (WA) position on quotas and affirmative action is that we believe that affirmative action of any kind is a matter of justice and does need to be looked at if there is malrepresentation. However, we do not believe in having quotas or formulas to do that. The Greens believe that any healthy organisation will have representation that mirrors its constituency. So the Greens look at their gender balance as a sign of health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our preselection we have no mechanisms whatsoever to choose on a gender basis. However, if, when we have made our selection, we find we have 50 per cent men and 50 per cent women candidates, we feel comfortable that we are progressing as a healthy organisation. Thus far, that has been the case. In the lower house there are 14 Western Australian electorates and in each case we have had seven men and seven women candidates, without actually intending to design it that way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, last evening in the debate on the omnibus Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 we were looking at the never-ending saga of changes to entertainment allowances. The amendment before us today actually reduces the taxable value of a benefit where the employer makes a payment or reimbursement to an employee to cover expenses incurred by the employee in entertaining clients or other persons on behalf of the employer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, the taxable value will be reduced by the amount of expenditure incurred by the employee in the entertaining of those persons. The result is that only part of the payment or reimbursement relating to the expenditure by the employee or associate will be included in the taxable value. This bill is really a corrective measure and an admission by this government to a serious oversight in the grossing-up changes to the tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers have major problems in the area of entertainment expenses and tax. It is an administrative nightmare for employers because of the different rules relating to it. Employers have problems with expenditure on in-house provision of sustenance or entertainment versus outside sustenance or entertainment, as well as problems with reimbursement versus credit cards and allowances for direct payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rules for employers and clients are really quite confusing. In addition, we have this distinction between what we believe to be sustenance and what might be entertainment. We have this distinction about whether the sandwiches and the chocolate cake are entertainment or sustenance. It is quite absurd when employers have to make these sorts of distinctions. It is no wonder that we have grey areas. It is no wonder that two days ago in the House of Representatives the assistant minister ran into trouble when trying to make a black and white categorisation in what is after all a very grey area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that as a result of this push-pull by the government to get this extra money arising from the previous legislation some of these after tax costs can be quite high. These costs can be as high as 129.85 per cent for taxable companies, or 193.8 per cent for taxable companies which have current year losses. I believe that this is going a little too far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was some clarification in a tax determination on 31 July&mdash;just one month after the previous announcement&mdash;which provided a per head basis for apportionment. That clarified the position a little. But I have many concerns about the government's approach to entertainment and to the FBT generally. The only plausible explanation for the government's approach to entertainment expenses is that it has lost sight of its original policy for FBT. The government now has this unquenchable thirst for what I call the FBT dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been astute in observing that it is really a big money spinner. If we look at the budget figures we notice that there is a 131 per cent increase to a massive $2.32 billion predicted for 1994-95. Of course, this money that is coming out of employers' pockets could be spent on investment and employing people. Instead of the money going into productive investment&mdash;which is not happening in this country&mdash;employers are having to pay it out in FBT taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the Treasurer, Mr Willis, on the review of the compliance cost. It sounds great, but unless he is prepared to forgo a certain amount of revenue, I cannot see anything substantial happening in this area. Business is being crippled by the FBT, which is levied at 48.4 per cent&mdash;the highest marginal tax rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the tax office and the government to take note of one very important point. FBT returns must be lodged by 28 April, a mere 28 days after the end of the FBT year. I ask the press to take particular note of this: being such a big money earner, this legislation is so complex, is such an onerous burden&mdash;given the substantiation requirements&mdash;and is such a drain on the cash resources particularly of small business that FBT returns desperately need to be brought into line with income tax return lodgement time. Partnerships and trusts must lodge their returns by 31 October, or four months after balance date where a substituted accounting period is used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This would relieve a lot of pressure from small business. Small business cannot afford the accountants which are required to prepare the many types of returns, all of which&mdash;FBT, income tax and sales tax&mdash;have different lodgement dates. So there is a need for both an extension and some rationalisation because it is a major problem, and I use this opportunity to draw that problem to the attention of the minister, who I hope will pass it on to his esteemed colleague. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, time does not permit a full discussion of many of the other measures in the legislation such as offshore banking, units, depreciation of employee amenities and foreign investment funds. However, I turn quickly to the development and general investment allowance. Pleasingly, the allowances are being extended to expenditure on plant, such as railways and pipelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased about the tax decision to change the $3,000 limit on partnerships, which is not in this legislation but was announced recently by Senator Schacht. In qualifying for that investment allowance, each partner will not have to contribute the $3,000. Honourable senators may recall that this was something of an anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the capital gains provisions. These were announced on 12 January and have been the subject of some industry consultation; but, not surprisingly, they failed to meet the unanimous approval of the business sector. They cover many aspects, including share value shifting arrangements, transfers between related companies, amendments of assessment, transfer of group company losses and rebate dividend adjustment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My immediate question to the government is: why are these provisions necessary when there already exist extensive anti-avoidance measures within our complex tax system? One of the consequences is to make conservative practitioners, who do not carry out artificial transactions at which the provisions are targeted, seem incompetent in the eyes of some of their clients because others within the profession have engaged in these sorts of things, and apparently get away with it until the law is amended. Not attacking it through the general part 4A provision is a bad administrative application by the Taxation Office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the government has introduced a series of amendments, particularly CGT ones, which will tend to overcome some of the serious misgivings in the original amendment bill. So we have an amendment bill and then a series of amendments trying to correct some of those worst features. I will just concentrate on this point a little more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather abhorrent that people on the fringe edge of the accountancy profession are given something like three or four years grace before the government introduces amending legislation. The government should try to enforce the existing law before it brings in these sorts of things because it only encourages tax avoidance. I have spoken about this matter to the Commissioner of Taxation because there is an administrative problem in not enforcing the law by allowing these people free time of up to three or four years before change occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Division 16E seeks to overcome a tax deferral advantage associated with the index securities compared with the variable content securities. The only reason I am not putting up amendments to these particular provisions is that they are only of a short-term measure anyway because the government has already issued a consultative document, and down the track there will be quite extensive amendments to securities generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, given that it is only a part-time feature, I do have this abhorrence to the daily internal rate of return basis applicable here. But, seeing it is only on a six-month basis, it is not quite so abhorrent as the daily internal rate of return which can take up to 14 pages of substantiation, which is ridiculous at a time when the government is talking about tax simplicity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why is this amendment necessary? It is necessary because the government's statutory corporations and agencies have been involved in a tax deferral scheme and a scam. Government-owned public utilities have been involved in a tax scam of deferring their liability. That is why we have this amendment, which again is going to affect all taxpayers, including the private sector. The present rule brings to account the fixed component of a variable return security evenly over its term. This will no longer apply because the amendments before us today will require the whole return&mdash;both the fixed and the variable components&mdash;to be brought to account on a six-monthly compounding basis, consistent with the existing rules of 16E, which apply to the fixed return securities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a flaw in the logic of this. The logic says that we have to get the economic substance, and that is why the concept of a six-monthly internal rate of return is necessary; but if the government is going to use that argument it should also use an inflation factor adjustment. We do not see that here. We are bringing forward the collection of this revenue on an economic theory purist argument without following through the whole of the argument. If we are going to use that argument we should use an inflation adjustment factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not go into further detail on 16E because I believe that it will be only a short-term measure and that there will be substantive adjustments. It is necessary to distinguish between banking operations and other sector operations; it is necessary to distinguish between interest and discounts and what I call valuation-type securities or derivative-type securities. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is the latest of those regular `plug the hole' bills that come before this parliament. Like other tax repair bills, it is hard to continue to justify the government's stated commitment to simplifying the tax laws because we are adding section after section of what some people consider to be almost incomprehensible gobbledegook.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The vast majority of the bill deals with new avoidance provisions on capital gains tax in share and financial transactions. Other parts of the bill deal with HECS contributions, uniform deductions, gifts, taxation of variable return financial instruments, extending the development allowance, offshore banking units, minor changes to foreign investment funds, and entertainment expenses. I want to make a few comments about the components of the bill we will be supporting before turning to the section of the bill we will oppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dealing first with the capital gains tax proposals, these are almost incomprehensibly complex. The Australian Democrats support, and have supported, the taxation of capital gains. We recognise that, as forms of investment become more complex and varied, of course the tax laws must follow. But it makes one wonder, in all these complicated changes, where we are with compliance costs and whether compliance costs could now be outstripping the tax raised. I question whether black letter jargonised law that takes four QCs and a tax officer to understand is superior to simple, common English law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the need to legislate against deferral of tax liabilities, but does it make sense to deem gains to be realised when a taxpayer transfers an asset to a trust of which he or she is the sole beneficiary? No money might change hands, beneficial interest stays the same, yet a tax liability arises. The government assures us that this is a loophole. There is an urgent need in the tax simplification process, after all this time, for capital gains tax to be rewritten. One is not questioning the principle; it is the application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another area of law needing to be rewritten is the taxation of financial arrangements. The move to taxation on accruals means that taxpayers can be paying tax long before they receive any income. Yesterday the government received a submission from the finance and business communities calling for major reforms to its accrual taxation system and a consultative process in the development of a new tax system. They pointed out that compliance costs of the evolving regime will be as much as $200 million. They even said that they were prepared to concede an additional $80 million in revenue to the government in exchange for a simpler system. I think it is worth the government's while to consult with that community, and I would hope that measures such as those contained in division 2 of this bill would then be modified and made fairer and more effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have some reservations about the amendment to the entertainment expenses. I appreciate that clauses 125 to 131 of this bill are largely relief provisions from earlier badly drafted FBT laws governing entertainment expenses, and obviously this area must be one for detailed review in the government's announced review of FBT compliance costs. The situation we now have is an accounting nightmare, with company accountants required to work out for FBT purposes how many hors d'oeuvres are eaten by employees and how many are eaten by guests. We know the principle, but it is in its application and compliance that I think questions are raised. The Democrats recognise that taxation of fringe benefits closes a large loophole in the revenue base&mdash;we accept that&mdash;but a tax has to be understandable. It has to be capable of being determined without too much fuss to be acceptable and understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the compliance cost of some of the recent FBT extensions could actually exceed the revenue gained, and we look forward to this review of the compliance costs of FBT. It must be fully comprehensive. If it shows that the compliance costs on a particular item are exceeding revenue, the government will face a heavy onus to justify continuation of taxes on the particular items. I am looking to that review with great interest. I guess that we support this provision in some respects conditional on a proper review outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains provisions in clauses 90 to 93 to allow the inclusion of HECS debts in the calculation of provisional tax. This was one of what we considered to be a range of regressive measures in last year's budget to claw back HECS payments at an accelerated rate. The Democrats have opposed all of those measures in this place and, consistent with principle, intend to oppose this one. My colleague Senator Bell will be speaking in more detail on these provisions later in the debate. </PARA>

Senator Watson has already outlined the coalition's concerns and positions on this bill. I do not propose to go into them in any detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Watson has done in particular is highlight the absolute shambles of this government's approach to taxation formulation and taxation policies. We now have a situation&mdash;we have had it for some considerable time&mdash;where the whole of the tax area is highly complex. So far as the simplification that the government has talked about in recent years is concerned, all we have seen is increasing complexity and increasing paperwork. We now have something like 2,000 or 3,000 more pages of tax law than was the case when this government came to office.

It is for that reason, amongst others, that the opposition will move the second reading amendment that has already been circulated condemning the government for its desperate pursuit of every last cent of revenue without regard to the costs that that imposes on industry and on all Australians; for unnecessarily adding further complexity to a tax system which it already has allowed to become excessively complex; for further extending and complicating the fringe benefits tax and capital gains tax regimes; and also&mdash;and this point has already been raised in the debate&mdash;for including higher education contributions debt in the provisional tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to use my time this morning to speak more broadly on the failure of this government's taxation and economic policies. What we saw in the budget brought down just three or four weeks ago was the squandering of what was a golden opportunity to address this nation's two most fundamental economic constraints: firstly, the lack of investment in the economy and, secondly, what is the flip side of that to some extent&mdash;the lack of national savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The great tragedy of this year's budget is that it did nothing to encourage or facilitate solutions to either of these things. On the contrary, the budget saw the end of the investment allowance on 30 June, it saw increases in corporate charges and it saw moves to curtail employee share ownership. All of those are quite the opposite of what is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also in the middle of the staged tax rises in petrol excise and sales tax from last year's quite deceitful budget. That is one of the important reasons there is such a huge revenue increase in this year's budget. The government's coffers this year are going to be overflowing for a variety of reasons, the most important of which, arguably, is the full-year impact of the savage tax increases that were built into the 1993 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of those policies will boost private savings or investment, nor will the huge increase in the cost of running government, compared with the earlier estimates that are enshrined in this year's budget. The administrative costs of the Commonwealth government this year, according to the budget papers, will be almost exactly $1,000 million&mdash;$1 billion&mdash;more than last year's forward estimates for 1994-95 envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there was one overwhelming concern with the government's budget strategy this year, it was with the magnitude of the budget deficit. It was far too high for the current economic circumstances. If the government wishes to claim, as it did yesterday with the release of the national account figures for the March quarter, that the economy is really booming along, the last thing we want is further added stimulus through the budget. But that is precisely what we have got. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, inevitably&mdash;sooner, rather than later&mdash;we are going to face savage interest rate increases on top of the already high level of real interest rates. I will come back to that in a moment. As I said at the outset, this is a squandering of a wonderful opportunity for the government to put its fiscal house in order. As Don Mercer, the Chief Executive of the ANZ Bank, so rightly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Failure to seize the opportunity of strong economic growth to cut the Budget deficit more rapidly is going to leave Australia with higher domestic and external debt than is necessary or desirable.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that Australia was `back on the path to boom and bust'. Sadly, that is a very accurate statement. The very highly reputable and respected financial house of Salomon Brothers, in a report on the budget last week, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has taken a high risk strategy in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say that this would lead to a rise in interest rates sooner because of the failure to cut the deficit further. As I said a moment ago, real interest rates in Australia are already at near all-time highs. Certainly we have had a fall in nominal interest rates over the last couple of years&mdash;and a very welcome fall it is indeed&mdash;but, nevertheless, those falls in nominal interest rates have not been matched by a fall in real interest rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is real interest rates that count when looking at the impact of interest rates on the real economy; on whether people are going to invest and produce more, whether they are going to contribute to job creation and the like. It is real interest rates, not nominal interest rates, that count; and real interest rates in Australia are the highest in the Western world&mdash;and they are near record levels in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why do all those things make such a difference? I have intimated some of the main reasons, but there are other fairly obvious points that need to be made in respect of them. The first one is that any debt today will have to be repaid tomorrow with higher taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia today we have two massive debt problems. The one that attracts most attention is our foreign debt. We now owe the rest of the world $210 billion. Figures released just two days ago show that the interest payment that Australia will make on that foreign debt this year alone will be $18 billion. That is $18 billion of exports that we have to export simply to meet the interest payments on the debt that we have already stacked up. It does not allow 1c for any repayment of that debt. The way the economy is going at the moment with the continuing very heavy balance of payments deficits, we are adding to that foreign debt by at least an average of another $1 billion every month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the mountain of debt on which we are paying interest increases month by month. International interest rates have fallen in the last couple of years, so the $18 billion interest payments that we are making would be much higher if interest rates internationally were higher. Those interest rates are on the move; they are starting to move upwards. So over the next couple of years we are going to be hit with a double whammy on our foreign debt interest payments&mdash;a higher debt to service and at higher rates of interest. That is one of the major debt problems that we face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major debt problem that we face, which the government has deliberately ignored and has squandered the opportunity to correct, is the amount by which the Commonwealth government's own debt has increased in the last few years. In the last five years the Commonwealth government's debt&mdash;its outstanding borrowings&mdash;have risen three-fold. The debt has risen from about $30 billion to something approaching $100 billion. That debt has to be serviced because interest is paid on it. Who pays the interest? The taxpayers of Australia pay the interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator O'Chee says, that ignores the additional debt that the government has imposed on the states by virtue of its Commonwealth-state financial relations. The effect of higher interest rates will, as I said earlier, be felt by lower investment, hence lower economic growth and lower employment. In waxing so eloquent and optimistic about the national accounts figures yesterday, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Treasurer (Mr Willis) very conveniently omitted to point out that in the March quarter private business investment in equipment, when we take out the one-off effect of a sale of the Gladstone Power Station from the public sector to the private sector&mdash;and that does not add anything to the total sum of investment&mdash;actually fell in the last quarter by 6.8 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have a sustained economic recovery without investment. If we do not have the investment, we do not have a sustained economic recovery, then there is no way in the world that we are seriously going to tackle, on a long-term basis or even on a medium-term basis, the chronic, crippling, cruel unemployment situation in Australia where we still have not far short of a million Australians unemployed. The government's own budget papers emphatically make that point&mdash;and this is the government speaking through its Treasury:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given present levels of excess capacity, economic growth can be maintained in the short term without substantial new investment in additional capacity. However, business investment will need to lift substantially as a proportion of GDP in order to achieve growth in the capital stock sufficient to sustain economic growth. While the forecasts point to a strong recovery in investment in 1994-95, further investment growth will be required in subsequent years to achieve the required growth in capital stock.</PARA>
<PARA>There the Treasury was quite clearly seeking to flag its concern with investment by including a major qualification in the budget about its forecasts. This is another very important quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The central feature of the economic outlook is the substantial pick-up in business investment. Forecasting business investment is, however, difficult since the timing of investment decisions is flexible and is heavily influenced by changes in sentiment. While an increase in business investment in 1994-95 is certainly in prospect, the strength and timing of the pick-up are less certain.</PARA>
<PARA>Even if we achieve the investment increase in percentage terms that the budget forecasts for 1994-95, and it is a highly questionable `if'&mdash;views as to whether we will get this 14 1/2 per cent increase in investment are mixed&mdash;there has to be continuing sustained investment beyond 1994-95 or we will simply be back on the boom-bust cycle that has so tragically wrecked not just the Australian economy over the last dozen years but, more importantly, has wrecked the livelihoods of millions and millions of Australians, particularly young Australians facing the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any one particular reason why investment will not pick up&mdash;and there are many reasons why it may not&mdash;it is the level of interest rates. This is one aspect over which the government itself can have considerable influence. Rising interest rates will stall any pick-up in investment that might otherwise have occurred. The Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer indeed are now issuing stern warnings that interest rates will rise. That is true. At least they are being honest about it. But they are not being honest in not telling the Australian community that the reason interest rates will rise sooner rather than later is that the government itself has not had the fortitude, the wit, the capacity or the ability to take the necessary measures in its budget to make less necessary than would otherwise be the case further rises in interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are some of the matters that are being swept under the carpet by the government and its spokesmen at the moment. Certainly the opposition does not want to sound like, nor does it propose to be, economic Jeremiahs. We welcome yesterday's national accounts figures that showed growth in the bottom line for the March quarter, but what we are profoundly concerned about is the underpinning of that in any substantial way. When we look at the make-up of that bottom line of impressive growth for the quarter, we very easily find grave concerns for the future: lack of investment and lack of saving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Household savings in the March quarter fell to the lowest level ever recorded. They fell to a rate of about just one-third of what they were as a proportion of household disposable income at the time that this government came to office back in 1983. Savings and investment are the essential underpinning of any sound sustainable economy. We do not have them in Australia today. Instead we are relying on a pumped-up consumption expenditure, very heavily government driven, that is not sustainable. It is essential that the government revisit its economic policies and, for once in its life, try to insert economic responsibility into its fiscal policy that is essential for the future of this country and its people.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to education policy include the decision to calculate HECS payments on a pro-rata basis and an increase in the amount that students can take out in the form of a student loan. Apart from addressing these changes and detailing our opposition to both of them, I take this opportunity to outline the Democrats' opposition to the government's continued pursuit of the user-pays agenda for higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Graduates are now liable for HECS payments even if they have only worked for part of the year. According to the government, students will be required to repay their HECS debt in accordance with the proportion of the year that they spent in work. Clearly, this is a measure designed to reduce the HECS debt that is owed to the Commonwealth. At the moment, outstanding amounts total about $4.5 million. The government has made no bones about its desperation to recoup these funds and has no qualms about the concentration of debt on students at an earlier age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has lowered the repayment threshold for HECS and has increased HECS repayment rates and levels. We have even seen above-CPI HECS increases, despite earlier government assurances. Students are now treated as debtors, even being referred to as bad debtors, as if they have committed some sort of offence. Of course, they have not. They have simply obeyed and conformed with government recommendations and allowances and gone about educating themselves, to find themselves without employment, being called bad debtors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government and the opposition continue to insist that HECS is a fair system of imposing user-pays education on students, the government should leave it alone rather than seeking to find ways of making it work faster for the benefit of the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have created concern among students and graduates and they have understandably confused and concerned employers.

They were the introduction of a minimum time in which students had to complete their degrees or else the level of HECS would be increased by 50 per cent for each additional unit, and the proposal to double HECS for second undergraduate degrees that were being taken. The intention behind those proposals was transparent: it was to get students to pay off their HECS debt faster and at higher rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with those proposals we saw the level of the threshold at which students began to repay their HECS debts being lowered from $27,748, the original amount&mdash;and the amount at which, I remind honourable senators, people would have made their plans and adjusted their activities accordingly&mdash;to $26,402. That is a repeat performance of this goalpost-moving exercise which the government seems to be seeking to perfect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another change in the parameters when the repayment rates for HECS debts were increased from two, three or four per cent to three, four or five per cent. If that sounds confusing to anybody who is trying to make head or tail of this, it simply means that when the threshold had been crossed and the students were starting to repay their debts, instead of paying it at, say, four per cent according to how much they were earning, they found themselves repaying it at five per cent.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a little later another public servant&mdash;anyone who is interested can see the name in the text&mdash;tried to say, `However, we do consult periodically with all sorts of representatives about general matters to hear their views.' That was not in dispute. What was in dispute was this: `With regard to the options of these specific changes, did you consult with the people who were going to be affected by them?' The answer was, "No.' I took up this public servant's lame defence by asking more about it. The public servant said;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a briefing with NUS, before the budget was announced, that outlined what these measures entail.</PARA>
<PARA>I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When was that held?</PARA>
<PARA>The public servant said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was held the day before the budget.</PARA>
<PARA>My question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Was the budget already tightly in place?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer from the public servant:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, Senator.</PARA>
<PARA>I then asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no possibility that that briefing&mdash;as you have put it&mdash;the day before the budget could have changed the government's announcement?</PARA>
<PARA>The public servant said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously that confirmed the original, accurate answer given by Ms McKay. I do not welcome the prevarications and the attempts of public servants who want to please ministers or whatever to try to represent an alternative answer to the essential question. The essential question was: `With these proposed changes that would affect students, did you discuss those changes with the students?' The answer is, `No.' The Labor government&mdash;either ministers or public servants&mdash;did not consult the students who were affected. Let it never be put forward by this government or by the department that they are fair dinkum in their current consultations about HECS proposals such as these. I will not bore the Senate with Austudy changes, which arose in the same estimates hearings, about which I asked, `Were they consulted?' The answer was, `No, they were not consulted.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regard this as another reason for the Senate to block these measures. The government did not announce these reforms prior to the election. It has no mandate to do this. It is penny-pinching, it is without consultation, and it is not acceptable to the Senate. As Senator Bell said in his speech, we have already debated&mdash;this was in the August budget of last year&mdash;the increase in the income threshold at which HECS debt is to be repaid. It happens that the parliament approved those changes on the merits of the argument. But these sorts of penny-pinching burdens, unfairly placed on students, are opposed by the Liberal and National parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government estimates that this measure will lead to an addition to revenue of $5 million in a year. This is a small amount, given the total HECS debt, but it is of great consequence to that minority of students it will affect. The government wants to put a $5 million burden on a few students after they graduate. That is not acceptable. I look forward to the Senate supporting not only Senator Short's second reading amendment but Senator Watson's committee stage amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address briefly certain measures in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. The 1994-95 budget was supposed to be a budget with no increased taxes. Yet, as a result of the budget and the taxation legislation which is now before the Senate, there will be record tax collections in the next financial year. This bill mainly embraces changes to existing taxation measures. Honourable senators should remember that in last year's August budget the government grossly increased the taxation take by way of a thumping big increase&mdash;and a continuing increase&mdash;in the price of fuel. Then it has the gall to say that it has not increased taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is concerned mainly with changes in FBT conditions and extending the tentacles of the FBT; the collection of HECS, which has been well addressed by Senator Teague; and changes to the capital gains tax situation. Mr Acting Deputy President, you and I have been in this place a few years now&mdash;maybe not as long as some others. We have seen the extent to which there has been taxation creep in Australia and the way in which the tentacles of taxation have been further and further extended to fund the government's budget&mdash;a budget that has not been funded by a natural increase in Australian business. However, we will address the state of the Australian economy at another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taxation is getting more and more complex. Employers are required to do more and more work in respect of compliance costs. These costs affect not only large corporations&mdash;at least they already have personnel on their staff that can deal with them&mdash;but also they have a great effect on medium to small business organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My eldest son, who is an accountant, tells me that in 1983, when this government came to power, the tax act had 2,731 pages. Mind you, he reckons that when he started his course in 1980 the act contained only a quarter of that number of pages. In 1994, 11 years later, and before this bill goes through the parliament, the act contains 6,713 pages. So, as I have already said, the compliance costs are continuing to grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the fringe benefits tax, for instance. In 1988-89, FBT compliance costs totalled $128 million or 10 per cent of the FBT collected at that stage, which was roughly $1.2 billion. We can add 10 per cent in compliance costs to whatever increase in tax the legislation now before the Senate will impose on employers, businesses and anybody else who pays tax. Compliance costs do not stay still&mdash;they definitely increase with increases in tax. So we can expect that 10 per cent will be added on. In comparison, PAYE compliance costs work out at about only 1.4 per cent of PAYE collections. So we can see that the FBT, which was brought in by this government, is a loose cannon that is being fired at everything. When the government has tried to plug gaps, another one has opened up somewhere else. This is going on continuously. The basis of FBT was supported by Senator Bell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always believed that the Australian taxation system could be run without a FBT if the old taxation laws were applied properly. However, I will not debate that now. Compared with PAYE tax, the compliance costs of FBT are totally ridiculous and out of hand. Australian business spends 11 times more in compliance costs than comparable business in the United Kingdom. Why should we be paying so much more tax than one of our competitors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An analysis done by Challenge Bank shows that in 1990-91 96 per cent of companies, on average, had higher compliance costs. As I said before, the compliance costs keep rising. Who are paying these costs? They are being paid by employers, businesses and individuals. The end result is less profit, which means that employers employ fewer people because businesses cannot grow. Compliance costs are picked up by businesses and employers for no reward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employers and businesses not only have to pay ever increasing compliance costs under this government's taxation act, but also they have to pay normal statutory accounting fees</PARA>
<PARA>associated with filing tax returns and copany returns, and so on. They have to pay for tax returns and company returns. As well as that, they pay fringe benefit tax and capital gains tax. Then, of course, state taxes must be added to that. So accountancy fees are an ever increasing cost for small and large businesses. Of course, this is good for accounting firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to another favourite subject of mine. While the government is loading these compliance costs on to employers, it has made no attempt whatsoever to recompense them for the free work they are doing for the government. Employers get no reward whatsoever for collecting PAYE tax, superannuation and the FBT, and it all goes to different places. I have here a copy of an easy-to-use schools information kit for teaching about tax. It is another brainwashing exercise by this government to teach in schools that tax is a good thing. I will not go into the merits or demerits of the government's brainwashing exercise for schools. However, towards the end of this tax guide for schools, which was put out by the Taxation Office under the name of Mr George Gear, from the other place, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Tax Office be reimbursing schools for their time and effort?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes. The Tax Office will pay schools $3 per student application in recognition of administrative costs incurred by the schools who participate in the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>My remarks seem to be causing some merriment in the ministerial advisers box, but I believe that this is relevant. The tax office will be recompensing schools by $3 for each tax file number. I know that $3 is not a great amount of money to be paying to schools for signing up a tax file number, and I cannot see why there is a great necessity for tax file numbers to be signed up in the school, except to give those students, while they are young, a de facto Australia Card number for the rest of their lives. But in this case the government at least recognises that there is an administration charge and gives the schools a small amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no recompense for business, of course. Public servants come up with these ideas to advise the government on how it can rake in more money. They must know, but they do not give a hang what they load onto the private sector, which has to make these collections and incur these higher compliance costs. Do the public servants ever talk to employers who incur these compliance costs about what it does to their businesses? Obviously not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing I can say is that I employ people;  I do not think that can be said about anyone on the other side of the chamber.

I speak with experience of these costs the government keeps loading on and of the time involved in compliance. The government has recognised this in the schools and is willing to recompense them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to HECS and the fact that the HECS repayment is going to be collected one year early by a different method. There is no argument that HECS has to be collected eventually when people, mostly young people, who have arranged to pay their HECS later on pass a certain tax threshold. They were led to believe that they would have to pay it when they reached that threshold, but the government has now decided to do something different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take first those under the PAYE system. The government, by steps, is going to collect this money 12 months earlier. I believe that that early collection will amount to $12 million, and once again the responsibility is loaded onto the employer. The employer has to find out from his employees whether they are liable for HECS.

We heard the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the radio this morning going off his brain because we have reached five per cent growth.

There is a big variation at the top. There is to be an eight per cent uplift from last year, and people cannot return more than that. By looking at the superannuation funds that are around we see they are showing the same sort of thing.

Therefore, it a real pleasure for me to join with those experts in talking on this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Kernot's contribution and a bit of Senator Bell's contribution and could not help but smile. The Australian Democrats, the very left wing of the Labor Party, are making the same old political points trying to criticise the government, when in most aspects they are part of the government. They, like the Labor Party, are the high tax party. They want to spend government money on every conceivable thing. The Democrats, of course, are a little better than the Labor Party. They want to spend all the money but they never acknowledge where they will raise the taxes from, except to put up taxes on fuel and things which impact most heavily on regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fairly lightweight contributions of the two Democrat speakers stand in stark contrast to the contributions made by my colleagues. One thing that can be said for the Democrats, however, is that they did speak on the bill and showed some interest in it. We notice that no senator from the Australian Labor Party is interested enough in these vital matters even to bother putting his or her name on the speaking list. The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) will speak only because he is required to close the debate on the bill. Once again, the Australian Labor Party has shown it has absolutely no interest in these vital matters of taxation and HECS that affect Australians so importantly. As my colleagues have said, we will be supporting the very sensible amendments to be moved by Senator Watson, amendments which will stop this government garnisheeing the wages of students to pay their HECS charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to that aspect of the bill which deals with fringe benefits tax. My colleagues have explained the specific provisions of this legislation as it relates to banks and the amount they charge their employees. Fringe benefits tax is one of those iniquitous taxes that are simply wringing Australians dry, particularly those in remote and regional Australia, and that is the aspect I want to focus on. I have no objection to fringe benefits taxes where they tax what is, in effect, wages where wages are converted to some other form of payment. Quite rightly, those should be taxed. But the way this government applies those taxes and the compliance costs are atrocious. Again, those issues have been mentioned by my colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regional Australia the fringe benefits tax has its most iniquitous impact. It impacts unfairly on people in regional Australia and costs them more than it does anyone else. I refer to a timely article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> quoting the United Graziers Association on this specific point. The association points out that many employers are required by awards to provide housing and other benefits. In some instances they are required to provide food, accommodation or housing free of charge. Because the award requires employers to do that, they are then slugged with fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Graziers Association relates that on average producers&mdash;that is, cattlemen&mdash;made profits of $9,300 in 1992-93 but that a quarter of that profit will be paid by them and swallowed up by fringe benefits tax. I dare say that someone like Senator Cook, someone who has worked for a trade union or for a government all of his life, would not understand what it is like trying to get by on a business profit of $9,300. That in itself is difficult enough, but when businesses have to pay a quarter of that on fringe benefits tax for providing accommodation and food which is required to be done by an award, the situation becomes intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United Graziers Association points out that in remote Australia accommodation provided to employees has no general commercial value. It is only of use to employees because in many instances cattle stations are so isolated. The United Graziers Association gives a number of examples, one of which is that a grazier in the area where I come from paid $4,000 in fringe benefits taxes every year for employing five men to look after 6,000 cattle. We simply cannot keep taxing the wealth producers of this nation in that way. The UGA also rightly says that this tax is against employment because it is a tax that employers have to pay irrespective of what profit they make. In other words, fringe benefits tax is a disincentive to the provision of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In remote areas often no other accommodation is available. Simply because there is none other available, employers, those who run cattle properties, mining companies and local government in the more remote areas, have to provide&mdash;either compulsorily because of the award or of necessity to get employees there&mdash;housing and other benefits. For that they are charged a fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Western Australian Municipal Association, in a letter tabled by Senator Panizza when this bill was being discussed in December 1992, pointed out that a fringe benefits tax particularly affects local governments in regional areas. The association pointed out&mdash;the letter referred to the Pilbara but this applies to anywhere in regional Australia&mdash;that employers are required to provide non-cash benefits to attract their employees to those distant parts which are often very difficult areas to live in. They have to provide some inducement, but because private companies and mining companies do that, local governments are forced to do the same to compete. In many instances housing is not available on the market. It has to be specifically provided. Because of that, local governments now have to pay the full fringe benefits tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the grossing up provisions, local governments have gone from paying 48.25 per cent fringe benefits tax to 93.2 per cent fringe benefits tax. People in private business paying income tax can deduct that fringe benefits tax from their income tax, so the actual cost to them&mdash;and that is what the grossing up is all about&mdash;is around 48 per cent. But local authorities, because they are not businesses and do not earn business profits and, accordingly, do not pay income tax, cannot claim any part of the fringe benefits taxes they pay as a deduction. So for other Australians in business, the fringe benefits tax is effectively around 50 per cent, but for local government it is an effective 93 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one level of government taxing another level of government. Local government in Australia used to pay about $16 million to the federal government in fringe benefits tax; it will now pay to the federal government $32 million in fringe benefits tax simply because of the way this government has drawn the legislation. That is not good enough. It is an effective clawback by this federal government of about four per cent of its payments to local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government pays local governments for general purpose grants&mdash;not road grants&mdash;around $700 million each year, but $32 million of that is repaid by local government to the federal government. That represents an effective four per cent of the money that the Commonwealth government pays local government coming back to the federal government. So effectively this legislation will reduce Commonwealth government grants to local government by around four per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that the Australian Local Government Association has not been more vocal in its opposition to this. Certainly the New South Wales Local Government Association and the department did a joint study on behalf of the government and the ALGA which showed the adverse effects of fringe benefits taxes on local government. But has this government done anything about it? No, it has not. It simply continues to rip taxes from other levels of government so that those other levels of government maintain the odium of having to tax their taxpayers more while this lot here escape that odium. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the federal Labor government had any courage, it would collect the tax in some other way&mdash;but it does not. It pushes that onto local governments and makes them increase their rates or taxes via their taxpayers so this government can escape that odium. It has been brought to the attention of this government time and time again, but it refuses to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting aspect is that the government has recognised that the 93.2 per cent tax on non-profit making organisations is very unfair. In introducing the legislation in 1992, in the minister's second reading speech, the following paragraph appeared:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Burns is going to speak; I look forward to that and to hearing him deny that his government cannot pass a piece of legislation or make a decision without the ACTU dealing with and approving it. The trade unions are now simply toadies for the Labor Party and political workers at election time. And did they not do well in the last three days of the last election campaign? They raised millions of dollars for the Labor Party&mdash;a great deal of which this government gives them in the form of grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been through this many times but it should be repeated at every opportunity. This government gives the trade unions grants, which then absolves the trade unions from using their own money; so the trade unions can give the money back to the Labor Party to campaign with at election time. So the circle goes round and round. In effect, this government&mdash;for so long as it remains there&mdash;will continue to use taxpayers' money to give to trade unions to enable those unions to give similar amounts of money back to the Labor Party. That is the sort of unit trade unions are now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What in that description qualifies trade unions for exemption from the fringe benefits tax? They own more property in this town than any single person, yet they get this exemption. We should contrast trade unions, which do very little for anyone except the ALP, with local government. Democratically elected local governments, which look after the interests of the citizens of our country in so many ways, have to pay the tax. This means they have to increase rates to their ratepayers and their citizens to pay this increase in fringe benefits tax. Trade unions do not have to do so. Where is the equity in that? There is none. Yet again this is a rort by the Labor Party in ripping off the taxpaying public to keep itself in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise those concerns on behalf of the people of remote and regional Australia about the disastrous impact that the fringe benefits tax generally, and particularly the increase in recent years, has had on people struggling to make a living and to develop the country in the remote and regional areas. I cannot understand why the minister and his advisers, and the Labor Party generally, cannot see that. The things that attract a fringe benefits tax in remote and regional Australia are not fringe benefits; they are not income substitutions. They are necessities of life and things that have to be provided, in many cases of necessity, to get people there and to give them somewhere to live when they get to remote Australia. But in many instances they have to be provided under awards&mdash;awards no doubt foisted upon the public of Australia by the trade unions which get a pretty good benefit out of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those taxes impact so heavily upon remote and regional Australia, and I cannot understand why the minister and his advisers do not appreciate that and do not do something about it. I cannot understand why they do not do something to relieve local government of this added burden. </PARA>

I would appreciate the minister explaining those things just for a couple of minutes in his response to the debate so far. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, which is an omnibus bill. It contains a host of amendments to taxation law&mdash;amendments that can be broadly categorised as closing off loopholes discovered over the last period and which arise from community consultation to smooth the implementation of tax law with the approval and support of many taxpayers. There are a lot of amendments; the explanatory memorandum runs to 171 pages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been several speakers in debate from the opposition and two from the Australian Democrats on this legislation. Whenever something appears on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> of the Senate headed `tax' a number of senators make a beeline for this chamber and use the occasion to express their views about taxation. We have seen that today. Broadly, the tone of the contributions has been worth while, even though I am bound to disagree, as I will now shortly set out, with many of the comments that have been made by senators in this debate. But I do thank them in the broad for a constructive approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can analyse in four parts the body of argument put before the government on this bill. First, we have a series of observations and indeed reservations put forward by a number of speakers, including Senator Watson and Senator Kernot, about elements in this bill that they will not oppose or will support. But in expressing their view about those elements they made observations and/or reserved their right to come back later and do other things. I acknowledge that. The government has listened assiduously to what they have said; it will take on board their comments, which will inform our future decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, several amendments have been put forward under the name of Senator Watson, which might be called the HECS amendments, dealing with the higher education payment. These amendments are supported, as we have been informed in this debate, by the Australian Democrats&mdash;Senator Bell in particular has led the charge there. That means that the government faces a majority and, on the numbers, we would lose the measures proposed in this bill. That being the case, I nonetheless want to put the government's case and why it is that even at this last minute the opposition and the Democrats should reconsider their position and change tack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, there has been an amendment put forward by Senator Short, which again I understand is supported by the Democrats. Indeed, Senator Short and the Democrats were vying for the honour of who could be first into the field to put forward this amendment. This amendment is in the form of a motion to add to the second reading motion and it comprises three points which essentially broadly condemn the government, although these points have not been expressly addressed or particularly argued by anyone. The amendment condemns the government for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)its desperate pursuit of every last cent of revenue, without regard to the costs that this imposes on industry and on all Australians;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)unnecessarily adding further complexity to a tax system which it has already allowed to become excessively complex; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)further extending and complicating the fringe benefits tax&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and a couple of other taxes. Let me just quickly dispose of this amendment, which the government opposes. It reflects Liberal Party policy in the main. We have no need to include Liberal Party policy to deform the structure of our tax laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section (a) seems to suggest that the government should not be assiduous in pursuing a proper and thorough collection of its tax dollar. A principle of taxation is that, while no-one likes paying tax, people accept their responsibilities and do so. But in accepting their responsibilities, they want to be sure that all those who have the same responsibilities meet them. So a motion of this Senate which condemns the government for ensuring that that principle is met is a motion which will just fall on deaf ears, be idle, and discredit those who move and support it in the eyes of the commentators and the media, because it just runs against a fundamental principle of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section (b) is the sort of motion that every opposition has moved against every government. Even if my party were in opposition and the opposition party were in government, it would be the standard stock motion and requires no other comment than ho-hum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section (c) omits the fact quite conveniently that the government has announced an inquiry into the fringe benefits tax in order to deal with some of the complexities of that tax. At this point in referring to the third element of this debate I simply rest my case and say that the government will oppose the amendment moved by Senator Short and supported by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, and lastly, we have a last-minute and, might I say, hasty amendment that has come forward under the name of Senator Watson. This amendment has arisen because as the debate has unfolded it has become obvious, I believe, to the opposition that it is on thin ground indeed. The amendments that it is proposing to the HECS legislation simply fly against the fact that the opposition did not oppose or indeed support, in the express words of the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), at that time the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives, the principle that we, in this legislation, are now seeking to apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, that fact being uncovered in the debate, principally by Senator Bell in his reflections on the coalition, the coalition has jumped forward and tried to remedy that in reverse by an amendment from Senator Watson which, I might say, the government will oppose. The government will oppose the intent&mdash;that is, the merit of the intent&mdash;to knock out this original principle in the first place, but it will also oppose it because the amendment proposed by Senator Watson is misconstrued. It goes far beyond what I believe is opposition policy and intent. If it were carried in the plain form that it appears before the Senate, it would completely remove the HECS from any assessment at all. I am not sure that that is opposition policy. If it is, the amendment does reflect it. But if it is not, the amendment is misconstrued and the opposition should withdraw and re-examine it. I counsel it to do so before this is put to a final vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I turn to the case on merit as to why the HECS amendment should fail, I must tell the Senate that we will oppose all the amendments. We will not accept them, which means that that part of the bill will be referred back to the House of Representatives where it will be supported again. The Senate will have a chance to reflect and hopefully analyse more deeply, and not as superficially as the debate has revealed, the merit of the government's argument. Then perhaps it will come to its senses and support the measures finally, lest there be set up and lest it be the intention to set up a trigger for a double dissolution at some other time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those words I now return to what has been the core of this debate and the one I acknowledge that has entertained the minds of most senators. As a final word before I actually go to merit, I point out that no-one has opposed the other elements of the bill and I thank the Senate for that. I thank the opposition and the Democrats for their support in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most fundamental point that I need to make on HECS is one that I have referred to already. On 19 October 1993 the then Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge), supported legislation which appeared before this chamber as well under the title of the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. His speech is recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He said, referring to the changes which will allow HECS to be provided under PAYE&mdash;and this is the important part of the quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the coalition is happy to support this.</PARA>
<PARA>The Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill&mdash;in section 18, application of Income Tax Assessment Act; and in section 19, disallowable instruments&mdash;adopted the principle that HECS can be payable&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Watson" NAMEID="VJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator Watson</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and payable under provisional tax and under PAYE. This was supported at that time by the opposition. In this bill we are merely having that principle applied in practice, but the opposition is now opposing what in fact in principle it supported. Interestingly, it is not opposing it because of some defect in our drafting or some clumsy way of applying the principle. No argument whatsoever to that extent has been raised. The opposition is opposing the principle. It is rebounding from and renouncing the principle that it originally supported.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very difficult argument for the opposition to sustain. It has performed pirouettes and contortions in order to do so. Nonetheless, the point I make is that the opposition here is renouncing its own policy. Interestingly, Senator Watson's third amendment will be moved despite the fact that this situation did not arise in the house where the honourable member for Chisholm is, of course, a leading figure in the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I need to make is that there appears to be some confusion in the minds of many people who are engaged in this debate. There is a constancy in opposition and Democrat speeches in respect of the alleged fact that this bill will deal with the payment of HECS under the PAYE system. Of course, it does not. It deals with it under the provisional tax system. We have announced that we intend, as would be appropriate, to change the regulations to reflect the principles we have adopted and which this parliament supported last year in the PAYE system. We will do it this month and, as I said, that will come forward by way of regulation. I make the point in passing&mdash;it is not one I want to dwell on&mdash;that at the moment we are speaking about provisional tax and not about PAYE tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn to some of the arguments that I think should be advanced to cause the opposition and the Democrats to reconsider. At the present time, if students under HECS meet the payment for HECS when it finally falls due, they do so as a lump sum payment at the end of the tax period. What this legislation would do is deal with that from a provisional tax point of view. But, as I have indicated that we intend to deal with it from a PAYE point of view, let me give a PAYE example. If students are on a minimum threshold of, say, $26,853, then under PAYE they will meet their tax obligations at $16 per week. As the situation currently stands, they would most likely meet it as a lump sum payment of $800 at the end of the tax period. If students in fact are on a higher threshold of $42,722, then the lump sum cost to those students at the end of the tax period would be $2,106. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the opposition and the Democrats are effectively saying is that that is better than doing it by weekly instalments. But I might say that every student I have ever talked to about this subject would much prefer to deal with it on a week by week basis than by way of a big slug at the end of the year. To insist that they cop it as a big slug at the end of the year is to overlook what the needs and desires of the students themselves might be. I say that with some confidence, not on the anecdotal evidence I have gathered in discussions with students over the years on this matter but because, as well as the government being of this view, so is the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, representing the vice-chancellors of Australian universities, and so is the National Union of Students, representing Australian tertiary students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So one is led to this entreaty to the opposition and to the Democrats: who do they think they represent when they try to prevent this method of tax payment? The National Union of Students supports the government, not them. The Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee supports the government, not them. They are the two groups which have the keenest and most focused interest in this matter. So, if they support us and we give effect to this measure, who do the opposition and the Democrats represent? Is this a fixation in their minds as to what should be the case rather than a reflection of what are the desires of those who are taxpayers and are affected by the measure?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest to members of the Liberal-National party coalition that before they proceed they should at least consult with the National Union of Students and the Vice-Chancellors Committee, gain confirmation of what I have just said, and reflect the views of those affected in legislation rather than pursue an ideological bent of their own which is not related to the interests of those affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Democrats I would say, `Well, at least you are entitled to half a mark on the grounds of consistency. Whenever HECS has arisen you have opposed it. It can be argued'&mdash;and I will not make this argument now&mdash;`not always as rigorously as you would pretend, but nonetheless you have opposed it. So anything that comes forward that has the infamous initials H-E-C, in your eyes, you will stand up and, in a knee-jerk reaction, oppose. But you need to recognise reality. The reality is that it exists and it will continue to exist. Therefore, if it does, why don't you find some generosity of spirit in your soul and give effect to what is a measure supported by the Vice-Chancellors Committee and by the National Union of Students?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the debate on this legislation an observation was made, I think by Senator Watson, that the Commissioner of Taxation was avoiding parliament by sending out letters to students advising them of the new arrangements under PAYE, and doing so as though they would apply from 1 July 1994. This was canvassed in the debate as some sort of bureaucratic jumping of the gun and as a bureaucratic way of sliding around the intent or will of the parliament. Of course, it is nothing of the sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commissioner of Taxation has an obligation to observe the acts and statutes of this parliament, and his actions on this occasion have been informed by the passage through the parliament in 1993 of the principle I referred to before to have HECS recovered from PAYE from 1 July 1994. As a consequence, there is a need for the administrative arrangements to be put into place for that time. The commissioner is not overriding but simply ensuring that the parliament's&mdash;and that is the government's&mdash;approach to these discussions is properly implemented. I think that might now be recognised by Senator Watson as a reasonable explanation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude my remarks by saying, as I did when I started, that there is a host of amendments of which all except a group dealing with HECS are supported, or not opposed&mdash;whichever formulation of words the opposition and the Democrats would care to use, and I do not baulk at any of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I have made a case which ought to give pause for thought. I invite the opposition and the Democrats to reconsider their position, but signify that if they wish to press their amendments, I will oppose on behalf of the government all three separate sections of amendments circulated&mdash;one in the name of Senator Short and two in the name of Senator Watson. Although it may well be the case that the government may not succeed in those votes, we will nonetheless persist with our task of sorting out taxation in this area of law to make it simple, more effective and more user friendly. We will therefore return this bill to the House of Representatives, but I suggest we will see it here in this present form in the very near future, with all the implications that that involves. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is rather abhorrent that, in terms of tax and tax commitments, the Taxation Office is using another bill effectively to create a charge which imposes a responsibility not only on HECS payers but also on employers. So we are seeking to remove these new responsibilities, both in this legislation and in another act, on employers and HECS payers, to return to the status quo, which was the contract and the arrangements entered into by these students and by the government. In other words, the government has changed the rules after the agreement and after the contracts were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did announce in its 1993-94 budget that there were going to be some changes. We are seeking to oppose those changes and to bring them together in the tax act, where they all should be. People who have tax obligations, employers who have tax obligations, should not have to read other acts such as educational acts when there are responsibilities in terms of penalties of up to $1,000. It is no wonder people are confused. Not only do they have to look at a tax act nowadays, but they have to look at an educational act to find out what their tax responsibilities are. We are seeking to try to simplify this. We are seeking to try to introduce some element of clarity to help the employers and the students. There are enough complications in tax without introducing tax elements unnecessarily in other pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government has done is to pull the wool over so many people's eyes. The letter that was sent out does exactly that; it does not give the full picture. After all, as we said, these amounts are indexed. How much is the government really going to lose as a result of these new arrangements? Oh, no; it wants to claw back more money from students who are just starting off in life. Not everybody can get a job with an employer. They may start off in a new little business. We know the current provisional tax arrangements almost ruin these young people starting off in life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being done? Their burden is being added to by also including the HECS arrangements under the provisional tax arrangements. Yes, this is in the bill, all right, but the provisions we are also debating are in the amendments. Yes, we are looking at two issues. We are looking at the provisional payments which are in this legislation and we are seeking to correct the errors and the responsibilities that were unnecessarily placed on people by the government through a backdoor method, by pulling the wool over people's eyes. No, we are not changing anything. Senator Cook is wrong. The government is changing something from a debt which was paid through the tax system to a provisional tax payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is garnisheeing people's wages as it has never done it before. It was always available to these students, if they wanted to go along to their employer, to have additional moneys taken out. A lot of people do this today for other reasons. That is still available. Senator Cook misled the Senate today. That provision has always been available. They can still do it as a result of our amendments. If they want to pay it that way, it is on a voluntary basis. But do not let us impose these heavy penalties on students and employers which the government is trying to do today. We are trying to remove these. So Senator Cook knows the intent of what we are after. He has not adequately explained, but he has implied there are deficiencies. What we are doing is taking out all of those abhorrent features. If he does not like it, he can bring it back to us. But he knows the intent of what we are about today. It is quite clear, as it will be clear to these students after this debate, when they re-read the letter that the government has sent them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeking to do is take out the dreadful subsection 106U(4). What we are really doing is moving back to the original obligations, to treat it as a debt rather than as part of the penalty provisions within the income tax system, because the government is changing the rules. What the minister did not do today, and what he should have done, was explain the reasons for the change. What he has not explained is that these amounts are already indexed. If the government is worried about any delay in payment, it will get extra money because of the indexation factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is trying to claw every dollar out of this. How else would it get an additional $12 million if not by changing the arrangement&mdash;and the government is changing it in a very significant way. Currently, HECS is payable on an annual assessment basis. What is wrong with that? The government has not demonstrated that there is anything wrong with it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Watson and the other amendments. The government has signalled its intention to change whatever legislation and regulations it sees necessary to enable it to collect HECS debt through the PAYE system, calculating yearly earnings on a pro rata basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original deal was that students would begin repaying their HECS debt when they graduated or when they started earning a salary of about $27,000 per annum. The threshold amount has been lowered to $26,400 but even that is not good enough. The government now seeks to start collecting the debt when, on a pro rata calculation, a student is deemed to be earning that amount of money per year. In other words, those who are fortunate enough to get three or four weeks casual work would have the rate of payment for that work calculated out to determine their yearly earnings had they actually worked a full year. If, on that calculation, their yearly earnings exceeded the $26,400, or whatever the new lower threshold is, repayment of their HECS debt would be deducted through the PAYE system. If an employer fails to do that, penalties attach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have a situation where, for the first time, the employer is involved. The employer has to ask each and every casual employee whether they have a HECS debt. They have to know, otherwise they will be up for a fine of $2,000, or whatever it is. They then have to readjust payments and send the relevant amount to the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as fair and gentle and easy as the minister portrayed it. It is not a terribly reasonable matter of simply repaying the HECS debt week by week. Senator Watson is perfectly correct when he says that that facility is already available. If students do not want to be saddled with a lump sum repayment they can make their repayments on a weekly basis. The government's scheme is not that reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns expressed to us have come from those who, as casual workers, will be saddled with a repayment of their HECS debt before they reach the agreed and already established level of repayment, which was $27,000-odd and is now $26,000-odd. That original arrangement was bad enough but now it will apply on a pro rata basis. For that reason we enthusiastically support the move by Senator Watson to ensure that this insidious, penny-pinching attempt to get money out of students is defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that, whether this measure suffices or whether other measures are necessary, the Democrats will oppose any regulation in any other legislation which is a part of this insidious process. That is where we are and that is why we are there. We are not at all convinced by the minister's attempt to make this scheme sound reasonable. It is not reasonable; it is unreasonable. It affects more than those people to whom the minister referred. It is particularly disadvantageous to those who manage to gain some part-time or casual work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be asking why repayments are being delayed longer than the government originally predicted. Why are so many of these HECS repayments coming in late? The answer should be fairly obvious. The reason is that those who have graduated have not been able to find employment at the level at which repayments should start. That is why the government has reduced the threshold&mdash;it is so eager to get its hands on money that it sees as its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The students who have been unfortunate enough not to gain employment at that level have committed no crime. They should not be considered as having done anything untoward. To devise ways of getting money out of them by seeking to have the repayments start at a less than an annual salary of $26,000&mdash;to take it out of casual payments that are extended pro rata&mdash;is immoral. It is an abrogation of the basis upon which the loans were made. The government should face up to that and dismiss any suggestion that it is moving the goal posts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor that I would like to mention is that of competition for employment. Because of the government's move, people with some sort of HECS debt will be less attractive as prospective employees. There would be a disincentive for an employer to take on people with a HECS debt because the employer becomes liable for ensuring that the payments are collected. Employers would therefore look upon these people with a less favourable eye. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, it is those who employ casual labour who would have to check on each occasion whether prospective employees have a HECS debt. If they do not check and it is subsequently found that their employees have not fulfilled their obligations, the employers will be liable. That is a direct disincentive to employ people in this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are we saddling people with an extra burden through this immoral attempt to retrieve money for which there is no obligation to repay, we are saddling them with the stigma of being less attractive to employers. For all those reasons these amendments are enthusiastically welcomed by the Democrats.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. The government is attempting to present this bill as a new bill but in fact it is the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993, precisely as amended by this chamber. We have gone through the charade of having this bill presented purely because the government was bloody-minded and would not accept the right of the Senate to amend the bill. It is as simple as that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We put the bill through earlier in this year and we made the point repeatedly that there was nothing on earth to prevent the government passing the bill into legislation, as amended. We were opposed by the government on that point. The government went off, under the then minister, and quite simply sulked because it did not get the outcome it wanted&mdash;that is, 100 per cent of the bill. The government got all the important points that it wanted in the amended bill. We now find the government has climbed down and presented the bill, as amended. Since it is the bill that was amended, we will have no difficulty in agreeing to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude my remarks on the bill, there are a few points I want to make. The Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) was presented on 4 November 1993 to the House of Representatives and the second reading debate took place on 7 February 1994. It came into the Senate on 8 February 1994 and the second reading debate was held in this chamber on 10 February 1994. In that debate, we accepted the bill and amended it by deleting the section that dealt with managed investments and retirement incomes, and I will come to that in a moment. It then went back to the House of Representatives on 10 February and was debated on 21 February. On the advice of the minister and the cabinet, the House of Representatives declined to accept the bill as amended in the Senate. It came back to the Senate on 22 February, was debated on 23 February, where the Senate reaffirmed its support for the bill as amended earlier in the month. It was returned to the House of Representatives on 24 February where it died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We opposed that bill because it dealt with changes to retirement incomes. The decision of the shadow ministry of the time was that, because of the great confusion and distress it causes the elderly members of the Australian community&mdash;not only in the ex-service community but all retired people&mdash;we were not prepared to support any more changes to retirement incomes policy until the government had had an inquiry and had come up with some coherent overall plan as to how it was going to handle retirement incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties with the government is that it is very bureaucratic and it simply does not understand the consequences for and effects on the ordinary citizens of this country of much of its legislation. This is particularly relevant to the aged and the retired sections of the community. As people age and get into their seventies and eighties, they do not like change. Their physical and mental reserves decline with the passing of the years and they have difficulty understanding change, particularly some of the proposals that the government has come up with for retirement incomes&mdash;the whole business of making notional assessments of profits from stockholdings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who have put away a little bit of money and have bought some shares have suddenly found that the Department of Social Security is assessing those shares as an asset, in terms of their market capitalisation on the day, irrespective of the purchase price. The purchase might have taken place quite a few years ago. Even though the price of those stocks that they are holding in their retirement portfolios may have risen in recent months, it may still be less than they paid for them in previous years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential unfairness of this is that those shares or those investments have not been sold, so the profit has not been realised. Until a profit is realised, it is not a profit at all. But these elderly people have had reductions in their pensions, and they are very concerned about that. People in their seventies, eighties and nineties do not have the courage to take on the government and fight it on issues such as this. So a great deal of fear and insecurity has been engendered by the crudity of the government's approach to retirement incomes policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that, the opposition said&mdash;and in this we were supported and are still supported by the Australian Democrats&mdash;that we are not going to have any more changes until the government comes up with an inquiry and has an overall view of what it wants to do in relation to retirement incomes. It was for that reason that we deleted part 7 of the bill, which made changes to retirement incomes policy. That is all we did. We thought that the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 was a good bill, with the exception of that retirement incomes part, and we supported it without criticism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government baulked at accepting the amended bill from the Senate. I do not know whether it was because of some ideological hang-up the government had, that it wished to denigrate the Senate and deny it any power, even though under the Australian constitution the Senate is in a position of parity with the House of Representatives, a power which we have always exerted in the years since Federation. It may have been because the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Faulkner, in a fit of pique because he had not got his way entirely, baled out of it. The sad thing was that the government showed a readiness to use the veterans community as a political football. I hope that under the new Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mr Sciacca, that policy will not be adopted, because I will be highly critical of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had the privilege of being the spokesman for veterans' affairs in the period from March last year to last week. One of my abiding principles was that I would not use the veterans community in any way at all as political tools to score political points. I am very concerned about the welfare of veterans. There are times when I think that the government's policy is not the best, but my fight is with the government. I never accepted using the veterans community as pawns in that battle. I am sorry to say that Senator Faulkner did that when he rejected the bill as amended by the Senate. It was all very pointless, too, from a political aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things people learn when they know anything about the veterans community in Australia is that it is an extremely well-informed and articulate group. Its members do know the procedures and provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act very well. They do know the history of the way the veterans community has been treated by successive governments. To try, as Senator Faulkner tried at one stage, to tell the veterans community that somehow or other it was those nasty people in the opposition who were denying them the benefits of a seniors card simply does not wash. The veterans community overwhelmingly knew what the truth of the matter was: it was because of the government's obstinacy that that bill had not gone through. It is interesting that from the moment Mr Sciacca came in he realised the folly of the position and he moved very rapidly to reverse it. He approached the opposition and said, `If we re-present this bill as amended, will you support it?' The answer we gave him was, `Of course, we will do that.' That was a bill that we were prepared to pass earlier in the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have the situation that the veterans community has been subjected to quite a degree of unnecessary stress over this. We have had the parliament involved in unnecessary expenditure while the bill was reprepared and rewritten and resubmitted to parliament&mdash;taking up time today. All that was quite unnecessary. The opposition will support this bill without amendment and we wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I was going to make which I think is a political point is that maybe the new leader of the Liberal Party should have taken that on board when sorting out the allocation of new shadow ministers.

I do acknowledge Senator MacGibbon's long interest in defence and related matters, including veterans, and our time together on the joint foreign affairs, defence and trade committee. I do acknowledge that and I do acknowledge his genuine interest in veterans' affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's bill, as Senator MacGibbon has said, is a bill amended from what was originally proposed. The government's view is that the proposed amendments to the managed investment legislation are beneficial for service pensioners with this form of investment. There are not winners and losers, as the opposition tried to argue during the debate on this bill last year, there are only winners. In fact, this is reflected in the commencement date of the proposed changes. The amendments retrospectively commenced from 1 April 1993. In weighing up the total bill, the minister felt there would be greater injustice for the 10,000 veterans and their dependants in not passing the bill at all. They would not be able to get the Commonwealth seniors health card from the Department of Veterans' Affairs from 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So Mr Sciacca and the government have made it quite clear that we do not want to punish in any way the 10,000 veterans and their dependants who we think clearly deserve this entitlement. We do not accept the opposition's criticism of the other part of the bill. We think it was a relevant policy as part of retirement issues in Australia. Nevertheless, we do not want to be a dog in the manger and have the whole bill collapse and have over 10,000 legitimate, eligible veterans and their dependants miss out.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very hard to get a smile out of the opposition, even when one produces news, as we did yesterday, that the Australian economy is growing at the rate of five per cent per annum, with the last quarter result of 1.9 per cent&mdash;phenomenal growth rates which give us all, particularly occurring as they do in the context of very low inflation, enormous confidence about the future. It is, of course, only a matter of time before that is translated through into the kind of investment surge which will ensure that that growth continues to be sustainable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in real terms over the year to the March quarter has been broadly based across all the components of aggregate demand. It is the case that private consumption has been strong; that grew by four per cent. The housing sector grew by nearly 10 per cent. Business investment, which does need to be stronger, grew by a little under five per cent. Exports grew by nearly 12 per cent over that year to the March quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to appreciate that exports continue to be a very significant contributor to that growth. It is not just consumption; exports are contributing directly to it. They grew by 2.2 per cent in the last quarter, building on strong growth in the previous one. Over the year to March they have grown, as I have already said, by 12 per cent. That was stronger than imports; imports grew by only nine per cent over that particular period. Net exports over the year to March contributed 0.7 percentage points to growth. So it is happening there, where we want it to happen, on the export side of the equation. Employment continues to rise; that increased by over 236,000 since the trough which occurred in April last year. The growth outlook for the budget for 1994-95 of 4 1/2 per cent certainly remains intact. All of this is far exceeding expected world economic growth, in particular by the OECD countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions for business investment growth do, of course, continue to improve all the time. Company profits rose by 5.3 per cent in the March quarter and by 14.8 per cent over the year, raising the profit share now to 18.3 per cent, which is at record levels. Business surveys, which are important in indicating expectations, are continually reporting very high levels of business confidence, the latest being the ACCI-Westpac survey of industrial trends putting it at its highest level for more than 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Capacity utilisation, which is one of the things that has been inhibiting investment because of productivity gains creating additional capacity which has not yet been fully utilised&mdash;or not until the growth boom really got going&mdash;continues to rise and is now at the point where we can reasonably expect it to be translated into new investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates, of course, are at an historically low level. As the Treasurer and the Prime Minister have been saying, there is absolutely no reason, on present economic fundamentals, to expect them to rise. The savings ratio, as I have indicated in answer to previous questions, is not as strong as we would like. That is one of the reasons why we are going down the path of superannuation reform in a way that the opposition has never liked but which will, over time, obviously be one of the major elements in place to ensure a shift in that to give us the capacity to produce that domestic investment in the way that we want without having to rely on further borrowing offshore. Of course that is important, of course it is a crucial component, but that is built there into the fundamentals of this economic strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very good news story, Mr President. The problem with those opposite is that they simply cannot bring themselves to act in a way which recognises the basic national interest that is involved. They are not interested in the national interest but in crude, opportunistic, political self-interest, and they will go on being miserable for so long as the news continues to be as good as it is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point Senator Herron made yesterday was that the drain from the private health insurance was going to put an unbearable pressure on the public health system. The point I made was that many of the people leaving private health insurance&mdash;from all the data that I have seen this is the case&mdash;are the young and healthy, and because they are young and healthy they put no demand on the public system. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Herron may argue as he likes.

His argument was that this put an unbearable pressure on the public health system and the public health system was in crisis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose by a long stretch that is some kind of supplementary question. Families with children are users of the health system, but Senator Herron and I would know that the largest users, at least according to the private health industry, are people probably over 70, not over 65. It is the old people in our community who are the largest users of health insurance, but there is also no doubt that, particularly in association with the birth of children, families are users of the health system. It is undeniable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The present crisis is about the failure of North Korea, the DPRK, to meet its treaty obligations to provide the International Atomic Energy Agency, and, through it, the international community, with information about its past nuclear activity. Of central concern at present is the DPRK's refusal to date to allow IAEA inspectors to undertake procedures during a defuelling operation that is presently going on at its main nuclear reactor at Pyongyang which would ensure that the agency would be able to undertake an effective analysis of the spent fuel rods at a later date. That analysis would allow the IAEA to reconstruct the operating history of the reactor to determine whether the DPRK has in the past retained undeclared spent fuel which could, if reprocessed to produce plutonium, be used in nuclear weapons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as present and future accumulation of nuclear material is concerned, as distinct from unravelling the past, the situation is somewhat less worrying. As of now, the agency, the IAEA, continues to have some safeguards arrangements in place for declared nuclear material in North Korea, including that which is now being unloaded from the reactor in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the main current issue, on 30 May the UN Security Council issued a presidential statement, which was unanimously adopted, expressing in very strong terms the council's concern at the DPRK's action in continuing to defuel its main nuclear reactor and, as a result, putting at risk the past data. The Security Council is due to meet again on this issue tomorrow, Friday, 3 June, with the Director-General of the IAEA reporting to the council on the current situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic question now in issue for the Security Council and for the international community to consider, if it is the case that historical data may be irretrievably lost, is whether to, in effect, draw the line on the past, concentrating efforts on ensuring that no further material is diverted for nuclear weapons production in the future, or whether not to draw a line, as it were, but rather to respond strongly, including through possible sanctions action, to the actions that have been taken by the DPRK to conceal its past activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter immediately in issue is the future of a third round of high level talks between the United States and North Korea which were intended to take place shortly to allow discussion to begin on a wider package of political, economic and security issues and so lay the foundations for a longer term solution to the whole nuclear issue. Obviously, a great deal of discussion is now going on as to diplomatic options for resolving the current tensions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say this about the military side of the equation: although there have been no recent indications of increased preparations for military hostilities on the Korean peninsula, the general level of tension has certainly not been helped in present circumstances by North Korea's very untimely test firing of a tactical anti-ship missile just a day or so ago, on 31 May. That missile is thought to be similar in design to the Chinese silkworm missile and of a type which is a fairly standard part of the inventories of most modern armed forces. The missile firing into the Sea of Japan was one of a series of tests which have been planned since early 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say this: resolution of the DPRK nuclear issue is obviously of the highest security significance to Australia and the region. We remain committed to dialogue and negotiation as the best way to resolve the issue. We are urging constantly all key players, including the North Koreans, to take steps which will allow this to happen. But, failing this, we would, as I previously indicated in this place, support action agreed by the UN Security Council.</PARA>

There are many of them; but in the time available I have only a dozen or so to offer. Nonetheless, they will make the point. For example, Nestle in 1989 took over Arnotts Harper, Arnotts' pet food business, and exports in that business have increased from around $2 million in 1989 to $50 million now. A similar story is evident in tools, where Sidchrome&mdash;Senator Kernot's colleague's former firm&mdash;was taken over by Stanley US; in food processing where Lactos was taken over by Bongrain of France; and in pharmaceuticals where Delta West was taken over by Upjohn US.

In minerals processing we have the processing of mineral sands through Tioxide of the UK, McGhie of the US and Ishihara of Japan; we have CRA developing the Hismelt process in iron ore making; and foreign technology being used in the development of the magnesite industry in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just a handful of examples gleaned in the last half hour or so from my office of the way in which foreign investment and foreign companies, many involving takeovers of Australian operations, have been contributing in a quite dramatic way to the Australian economy. The point is that this is part and parcel of the whole business of the internationalisation of the Australian economy. It is a two-way flow; there is business out and business in&mdash;and each way we are benefiting from it.

The question is an appropriate one to be answered by the Minister representing the Minister for Finance, and the Minister for Finance has provided me, thankfully I might say, with an answer. I will take in order each of the three questions Senator Coulter asked me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the prospectus makes clear that the government intended to provide 35 per cent to bidders in the bookbuild process, of which a maximum of 20 per cent was available to foreign institutions. No individual purchaser was entitled to receive more than five per cent of the company. In the event, slightly more than 35 per cent was allocated to bidders who participated in the bookbuild process. Shares allocated to foreign institutions aggregated it to the 20 per cent cap that had previously been foreshadowed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other bidders in the bookbuild process, which included domestic institutions and members of the Australian Stock Exchange bidding on behalf of their clients, received the remainder. This reflected the strength of bidding in the bookbuild and reallocated stock away from a few substantial subscribers to the public float towards domestic individuals and entities which had bid in the bookbuild. Some 90 per cent of the subscribers of the retail offer received the amount they had bid for. All up, retail investors were allocated about 70 per cent of the total stocks on offer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the second question, the government called for bids for the bookbuild process in the range of $2 to $2.40. Bids were made by those who participated at a number of points within that range. Having regard to the demand expressed at each pricing point, the government decided to establish a final price of $2.30. This was a price at which the government's sale objectives were met, including to achieve a dispersed ownership, with no more that 20 per cent held overseas and with good prospects that there would be an orderly aftermarket.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With so many smaller investors in the float, the need to establish an orderly aftermarket was viewed with particular concern by the government. I note that CSL shares are now trading at a small premium, though less than typically occurs in respect of a more traditional fixed price approach. Just before the start of question time, CSL shares were trading at just over $2.40, suggesting that the price struck in the float was about right.</PARA>

The Attorney-General considers making such a request only when asked to do so by the relevant authorities of a state, territory or the Commonwealth. I am further informed that, unless there is some reason in the public interest to announce that a request has been made, it is not the normal practice to make public whether a request has been made or is under consideration.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Garrie,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 24 March 1994 concerning the World Court Project on the illegality of nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware, this government is completely committed to nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. Australia is amongst the most active countries internationally in promoting these objectives. Apart from our strong support and encouragement for nuclear disarmament negotiations (including the unilateral and bilateral agreements of the recent past between the United States and Russia), we are actively involved in strengthening and extending indefinitely the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and are taking a leading role in the conclusion of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. We are seeking agreement on arrangements against the use of nuclear weapons (Negative Security Assurances) and on the conclusion of a Convention providing for the cut-off of the production of fissionable material for weapons purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given our strong commitment to nuclear disarmament, evidenced by our promotion of these practical measures, it will come as no surprise that the Government and I, personally, understand very well</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the motivation of the proponents in calling for an advisory opinion on the legality of the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons by the International Court of Justice (ICJ). There are, however, some rather complex aspects to this question which raise some real concerns in my mind (which I know are shared by many of my colleagues around the world) about seeking such an opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proponents of the project seem to assume the Court will find that the possession and/or use of nuclear weapons are necessarily illegal. I have doubts about this. I fear that the Court may well rule that certain uses of nuclear weapons may be legal in particular circumstances. These include if the weapons were used for defensive or retaliatory purposes in a manner proportion to the attack and with due regard to discrimination in targeting. The Court could hold that the use of nuclear weapons might be legal as a response to a nuclear attack. The Court's decision could even extend beyond a finding that the use of nuclear weapons might be legal as a response to a nuclear attack only. I do not think that it can be assumed, for example, that the Court would necessarily reject NATO's "flexible response" doctrine, under which nuclear weapons are maintained as an option for responding to an overwhelming conventional attack. I am not certain that such a ruling would assist the cause of nuclear disarmament or move us any closer to the complete elimination of nuclear weapons. Indeed, such a finding could complicate the already difficult process of extending the NPT in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In raising these doubts I am conscious that the legal opinion of key states, which here includes the nuclear weapon states (NWS), is to some extent definitive of international law, and will have to be considered by the Court. The bitter differences of view on nuclear weapon matters between many non nuclear weapons states (NNWS) and the NWS, in the context of NPT review conferences and the negotiation of the 1977 additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions (where the NWS entered reservations on the applicability of humanitarian law to the use of nuclear weapons), attest to the unlikelihood of a categorical, let alone enforceable, judicial verdict on the matter of nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapon states are likely to make cases to the ICJ justifying their approach. It is for these reasons that I continue to believe that, whatever the ruling of the ICJ, it is unlikely to affect significantly attitudes of the nuclear weapon states to nuclear disarmament, and may, in fact, even have the effect of hardening their policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even a ruling declaring all uses of nuclear weapons illegal could create problems in the disarmament process, which will necessarily be negotiated carefully by the nuclear weapon states within the context of their own security perceptions. In order to manage the possession but non-use of these weapons until such disarmament is achieved, the Australian Government, along with most others around the world, has supported the principle of stable deterrence&mdash;that is, a deterrence based on the perception that any first use of nuclear weapons would be met with a sufficiently large retaliation as to render unattractive such a first strike. Obviously support for that principle is premised upon acquiescence to possession and the threat of use of nuclear weapons, provided that such possession and threat of use is directed to the purpose of deterrence of the use of nuclear weapons by someone else. I do stress that the Government, while supporting stable deterrence, does so only as an interim measure until nuclear disarmament is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, given these very complex political, legal and strategic considerations my present view is that it is very doubtful whether the World Court Project will contribute to accelerating movement toward the goal it seeks to achieve. Certainly the range of negotiations taking place currently, in the absence of an advisory opinion, suggest that what you and I would regard as a favourable opinion is not a precondition for nuclear disarmament negotiations. Encouraging progress on these issues is being made in the context of START, in the Conference on Disarmament and in a number of other multilateral and regional forums. Australia, of course, will continue to be a central player in most of these forums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At this stage, the Government has taken no decision on the questions of whether it will be submitting a written statement to the Court on whether we intend to present argument at any oral hearings. This will be a finely balanced judgment which will take into account the arguments I have outlined above&mdash;and also the fact that, for better or worse, legal process is now under way. I will certainly let you know our intentions when a decision is made.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summarising a very complex set of concerns in just a couple of sentences, let me say this. A finding that the use of nuclear weapons was in fact legal in some circumstances&mdash;even if, for example, only by way of retaliation against certain kinds of attack&mdash;would in our judgment have very negative implications for the NPT and global non-proliferation objectives, giving considerable encouragement to those who do not share our disarmament aims. On the other hand, a finding that all use was indeed illegal would be in contradiction to the current stated doctrines of all existing nuclear weapons states and, as such&mdash;let us face it, in the real world&mdash;is quite unlikely to have any effect in practice on their approaches to nuclear disarmament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World Court decisions are not self-executing. They have to be obeyed, and disobedience would undermine the authority of the court at a time when that authority has never been more badly needed. We think that, on balance, the important negotiations now being constructively carried out through bilateral arrangements and in various multilateral forums will simply not be assisted by the court deciding on the legality question. We will accordingly be submitting to the World Court that it exercise its discretion not in fact to determine the substantive matters at stake.

In the 1993-94 financial year, investment in rural research and development was around $700 million. Over half of that money was directly contributed by the Commonwealth government: $126 million to rural research and development corporations under the matching dollar for dollar arrangements; on top of that, $85 million direct for rural research to universities; $20 million to the cooperative research centres; and $140 million in direct funding to the CSIRO, making up 40 per cent of the total research effort of that organisation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Operating costs such as fuel tax, as my friend Senator Campbell suggests, are driving hundreds of Australian farm families off the land every week. They can no longer make ends meet because this government, instead of fostering primary industry, is using it as a milch cow. In the most despicable and disgusting fashion, it is robbing Australian farmers with outrageous and rapacious taxes which bear absolutely no resemblance to the profitability of those farms. I am sure that most Australian farmers would not mind paying their tax, provided they were making a profit, and that is the key. The taxes this government puts on the farm sector in our country are taxes the farmers have to pay on their costs. They are taxes on input costs, and they make those input costs all the more expensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was advocating a completely different approach&mdash;not putting a tax on top of costs to make those costs more expensive but reducing the costs, allowing farmers to make a profit, to stay on the land, and then taxing expenditure and taxing the income, the profit that is made after all the costs have been met. What could be fairer as far as the farm sector is concerned? Mr Deputy President, you have quite a lot to do with farmers in your home state of Western Australia, as does my colleague Senator Panizza. We have a situation where those of us on this side of the chamber know very well that the government has no interest in the farm sector. </PARA>

This government claims that it should be congratulated. This is the same people who, at the Australian sugar industry conference, were suggesting that it might not be a bad idea after all to float off and sell the experimentation stations used to support the sugar industry. There is only one reason why the government would want to do that: if the experimentation stations were sold off, it may well relieve the government of having to provide its matching dollar for dollar funding for sugar research. That is the real reason it is interested in discussing the concept of selling off those research stations.

Senator O'Chee did not attempt to rebut that central fact, because it is true and it is a dramatic improvement on what that lot opposite did when they were in government 10 years ago. I would like to refer specifically to one industry where the commitment of government has gone from virtually nothing to over $20 million last year. That industry is horticulture. In 1988-89 when the Australian Horticultural Research and Development Corporation was established by this government, $2.1 million was spent on horticultural research. This is the second largest agricultural industry in Australia. I notice that Senator Panizza is leaving the chamber; he should stay and listen to these facts. Does he know how much money is spent in that industry by the HRDC today? Over $21 million. Where is the reduction in agricultural research? Half of that money is contributed by this government in a direct dollar-for-dollar grant.

The HRDC funds a Queensland research program on macadamias; bug damage to pecans; this might interest Senator Panizza&mdash;research to cut banana spray costs; a vegetable weed control program; the controlled release of insecticides&mdash;a further research program.

There has been a differential decrease in so far as more families than single people are dropping private health insurance. That puts the lie to the statement the minister made yesterday and is something that she did not seem to understand today when I asked my question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting thing is that in the last year the number of under-65s taking private health insurance has decreased by 5.3 per cent, whereas the number of over-65s taking private insurance has actually increased by half a per cent.

Between August 1989 and August 1993 alone the number of long-term unemployed more than trebled as a direct result of the then Treasurer Keating's deliberately engineered recession. Today 800,000 more Australians are receiving social security benefits than when this government came to office, despite a considerable tightening of the eligibility requirements for such benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The number of unemployment benefit recipients is up 44 per cent; disability pension recipients are up 85 per cent; and sole parent pensioners are up 33 per cent. We are not just talking about cold statistics; we are talking about real people&mdash;real personal needs, real personal tragedies. In Australia today youth suicide rates are amongst the highest in the world. Not all of this tragic fact can be laid at the door of the economic situation, but certainly a large proportion of it can. Why? Far too many Australians feel they have lost the reason to hope that there is a better future ahead of them, that there is a `light on the hill', that there is that `vision' thing of which we have spoken in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many feel that they are the deprived people of Australia&mdash;that this government and this Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in particular have turned them into a permanent underclass. This is happening while the same Prime Minister, of course, lives in luxury and spends the taxes of the poor on Gould prints, teak tables, $200,000 carports and all the other trappings of imperial office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This same man is flying off to Europe today for the D-day celebrations, and I am very glad indeed that he is. But he is going despite his initial decision not to attend because he did not even know that Australian service men and women had participated in Operation Overlord. This same man, Mr Paul Keating, was the architect of the economic policies that led coldly, calculatedly, deliberately and cruelly to the establishment of a permanent underclass in this great nation of ours through an arrogant disregard for the fundamental requirements of economic policy and whose policies have led to the neglect and the discarding of those millions of hardworking, decent middle Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's rich mates are okay; by and large they have done well. Even the high income earners have not done too badly. The top 10 per cent of wage and salary earners are some 7 1/2 per cent better off in real terms today than when Labor came to office. But even that is a pitiful increase compared with the potential that this nation has to provide. Under this government the bottom 10 per cent of wage and salary earners have actually gone backwards, on average by between five per cent and 10 per cent. So the gap between the higher and lower income earners has widened quite dramatically since 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The well-off have become more well-off, while the real incomes of the lower income earners have actually fallen. That is just for those with jobs. That does not take account of the 400,000 long-term unemployed, the nearly one million unemployed, the further half million underemployed, and the 800,000 additional people who depend on social welfare for their existence. Taking all of those into account along with middle Australia, the lower income recipients of our society have fared very badly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not have to be like this in Australia. It is a disgrace that we have an underclass at all, let alone one that seemingly has become permanent. The only reason for this obscene predicament is the policy failures of this government. In the main they have been failures of economic policy, but this government's record across the policy field as a whole has been appalling: we have had huge tax increases over the past 10 years to fund excessive, wasteful spending by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this government came to office the tax take has gone up from something like $45 billion a year to this year's record $120 billion. But even with that huge increase in taxation, it has not been enough to fund the government's spending. As a result, in the past five years alone the government's debt, the government's borrowings have increased three-fold from about $30 billion to $90 billion. That debt commands interest which has to be paid&mdash;let alone paying back the debt&mdash;and the interest can only be paid by the taxes of wage and salary earners in the main. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a totally irresponsible, reckless economic budget policy which has caused that debt to blow out like a huge balloon. That ignores altogether the foreign debt that has been built up under this government&mdash;an almost eight-fold increase in our foreign debt to a figure now in excess of $210 billion. That debt has to be paid for with interest payments, which alone this year will cost Australia $18 billion. That pressure by government for borrowing increases interest rates. In Australia today, despite the fall in nominal interest rates over the past couple of years, we still have arguably the highest real interest rate in the Western world. If it is not the highest, it is within the top two or three. That has all happened because of the government's inability to get its own fiscal house in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those budgetary disasters and policy failure, we have seen in this government a failure to grasp the nettle of industrial relations reform. The government, time and time again, toadies to the trade union movement in the reforms it will allow to be introduced in this country. As a result, the extent of change is far too limited relative to what this nation needs if we are going to provide the flexibility in the work force and the terms and conditions of employment that will allow Australians to earn a better living and have a better way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a failure to undertake the necessary reforms to make our ports, shipping, transport structure, communications, power generation and distribution and our water supply&mdash;that is, our basic infrastructure industries&mdash;more productive to make Australia sufficiently competitive. There is a failure to provide the necessary incentives, the climate, the overall culture for Australians to produce more, to do so more productively, to earn more, and to keep more of the rewards for their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues Senators Brownhill and Knowles will have more to say about these matters. Let me conclude by repeating that it is the policy failure of this government, and that alone, that has widened the gap between the rich and the poor, that has disenfranchised middle Australia and so tragically produced the permanent underclass we have today. It need not have happened; it should not have happened; and it will not happen under a coalition government. </PARA>

I think that is probably true, on the figures I have in front of me, but Senator Short did not attempt to analyse why that is so and in what areas that is occurring. He missed out a couple of very important areas. The significant reason for the growth to 800,000 of Australians receiving social security is in one major area&mdash;the growth of pension payments over the last 20 years. Why is that so?

If we put that into context, the great bulk of women who are going onto the sole parent's pension are separated wives. Most of the rest are separated de facto wives.

I do not blame the Thatcher government largely for what has happened with family relationships in the United Kingdom, any more than those opposite can blame us for the changes in family structures that have occurred in society.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, half of Senator Short's speech was spent talking about the alleged economic failures of this government, and he continued with his normal negative economic doom and gloom news. Even when there is some good news around, why does he not mention just one or two good points in his speech? Interestingly, on the question of economic statistics, again it is a matter of the use and abuse of statistics. I suppose we all get used to this in politics and we all indulge in it to some extent or other. Senator Short talked about the $45 billion tax take of the government back in 1983, when it took office, and now the amount is $120 billion, or whatever the figure is that he gave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant figure is percentage of gross domestic product and how our tax take compares with that of other countries.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of this issue, which has had some public prominence over the last week or two, a great deal of comment has been drawn from a recent ABS survey which alleged that living standards have declined in some areas for some people in the last 10 years or so.

Returning to the ABS survey, it is a fact that the standard of living of low income families, if we take into account government transfer payments, has not decreased since 1983.

The government will spend $6.5 billion over the next four years to assist less well-off Australians, including $4 billion on employment and training initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another program, for example, is rental assistance, which was extended to low income families in 1987 and has since been significantly increased and indexed. The Labor government has delivered real increases in rent assistance for people without children and even more for families with children. In the budget, the government announced measures to assist the homeless, including accommodation assistance costing $63 million over four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1983&mdash;I continue to remind the Senate of this, and particularly the aged in our community who I see in the electorate&mdash;the value of the pension has increased significantly. It is our government that has carried out the commitment to index the age pension to 25 per cent of average weekly earnings. It is our government that did that, in stark comparison to those opposite when they were in government. We have been very pro-active in assisting in every area of our society where there are disadvantaged people. </PARA>

I will not necessarily put my own arguments but the arguments of others which reinforce that. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of Wednesday, 1 June, a Sydney economist, Frank Stilwell, stated:</PARA>

<PARA>Despite Senator Sherry's detailing of some of the things which the government has done&mdash;and we recognise that&mdash;he has not addressed the question, which is that the gap continues to widen despite the efforts of his government.

<PARA>In other words, we measure people's value in terms of their economic contribution or their wealth, and we are increasingly rewarding those who pursue the profit motive in isolation from social ethics. To underline what this has meant, I quote again from Professor Frank Stilwell. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia Can Work: An Alternative to Recession</EMPHASIS>, he states:</PARA>

It is very likely that if they do still buy they will be caught in the upward interest rate spiral. These are all policies that this government has foisted on the Australian people and that have given us a class of underprivileged and overpoor people in the rural economy.

Policies include cutting public spending, privatisation, corporatisation and introduction of user-pays funding wherever possible, particularly with respect to services for the general public. Opposition members claim, however, that the concept of making the wealthy or corporations pay would interfere with corporate profitability and would not encourage investment or economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also followed policies of deregulation of industry and trade, which has led to a situation where the nation is increasingly dependent on transnational corporations, and consequently the government has very little scope to influence the fundamental factors of the economy, except through the offer of yet more incentives for overseas corporations so they will come here instead of finding somewhere else to exploit. While this motion decries the creation of a permanent underclass, I feel the issue is more appropriately the growing concern in the community that the maintenance of an economic fundamentalist approach to public policy has patently created this gap between rich and poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of pursuing that economic philosophy is not unexpected. Companies have shown huge profits and little or no responsibility. That lack of responsibility or concern for this nation is evident in their continual reminder that they can always go somewhere else and will do so if investment attraction is greater. An example of industry attitude can be found in an article on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 20 May 1994. It stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Corporate Australia notched up pre-tax earnings of almost $6 billion in the March quarter&mdash;a 13% rise on the December quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But big WA employers insisted that they must serve their shareholders first. They were not responsible for curing society's ills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They pointed to the corporate bible, the Australian Corporations Law, which says nothing about helping unemployed people or the national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the basic ways government can promise good profits to the rich is by holding down costs. Two main costs government can control are taxes and labour costs. Reducing taxes, as governments have done, means cutting services and finding someone else to pay for what services we keep. Since the someone else is generally the ordinary people of the community and services cut are services used by that section, both changes have negative impacts on the public. To reduce labour costs will also impact on normal people. While real wages for wage earners declined, salaries for corporate executives skyrocketed. The rich get richer at the expense of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper has done nothing to address this situation. In fact, the government's recent initiatives will result only in a situation in which this nation develops a growing number of working poor. Many of these people will join the social security merry-go-round as they go from training schemes back on to the unemployment queue because there are no real jobs for them to go to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basic strategy of both government and opposition is that to increase jobs it is necessary to increase profits for the rich so that they will have to come here to invest. To attract the rich we try to guarantee them certainty. This is a one-way agreement, since there is no reciprocal guarantee that the rich will invest in anything productive or contribute to the communities in which they operate. It is a formula for increasing the difference between rich and poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of this gulf is of concern. We have had clear evidence that the rich have gotten richer and they have done so even during the recession. The BRW rich 200 charts the incredible increase in wealth for the rich. Mr Packer's official wealth jumped 80 per cent to $5.5 billion. The Murdoch fortune increased by only 20 per cent to a figure of $5.5 billion. The combined increase in wealth in these top 200 was a staggering 30 per cent and reached a cumulative $36.7 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the government disputes the idea that people were actually worse off, although some memory of the last 12 years should provide ample intuitive evidence. I have obtained some interesting evidence from an unusual source&mdash;a report commissioned by the ACTU from the Social Policy Research Centre. This report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Funding options for unemployment, industry and regional development</EMPHASIS> confirms that indeed this gulf between rich and poor has grown.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating government's policies which have widened the gap between rich and poor and entrenched a permanent underclass in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not the situation. I will make a comment on Senator Margetts's speech. We can point to very wealthy people in Australia but it seems to me that there is no harm in having people who are wealthy. If they can accumulate capital and income, good luck to them. The real issue is whether or not people are being left without proper support&mdash;support by income or other means. That is what we have to look at; whether or not there are people who are at such a disadvantage that the community ought to step in and help. It does not seem to me that we ought to look at the richest end of society; it is a matter of whether we can do something for those who are in great need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has done many things, including assisting the rural poor. I will cite some statistics. From March 1983 to March 1994, the following real increases in social security payments were achieved: an increase of 14.9 per cent&mdash;almost 15 per cent&mdash;to single age pensioners; an increase of 57 per cent to single unemployed renting; an increase of 31.5 per cent to sole parents with two children renting; an increase of 90.8 per cent in rent assistance for single people without children and 139.4 per cent for people with three or more children; and an increase of 152.8 per cent in additional family payments&mdash;AFP&mdash;for teenage children and nearly 80 per cent for children under 13 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all these areas there has been a marked and major improvement against the Henderson poverty line, which itself increased by 16 per cent in real terms over the last decade. These comparisons do not take into account the government's measures to improve self-provision resulting in an increasing proportion of all groups of social security recipients, and sole parents in particular, being able to partly or even fully provide for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, improved client service delivery and family integration in January 1993 have increased the take up of benefits, particularly family payments. That is an illustration of what this government has done to help those whom we should be aiming at; those who are deprived in terms of income and the jobs available to them, education and other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the economy is booming and that is the headline in most of the papers today. That, itself, will bring back much more confidence and consumer spending, and much more activity in the community, which will then lead to a much greater distribution of income. I do not mean that things should be left to the trickle down theory. The reality is that as the economy gets better, the ability of this community to help those in need will increase&mdash;and this government will be foremost, as it has been up till now, in seeing that those in need are helped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last few seconds of my time I want to return to the point that Senator Sherry addressed; that is, the ABS survey which has been mentioned here today. As Senator Sherry said, that did not take into account non-cash benefits such as access to concessions, health services and public housing. That is a point that should be made in the context of this debate. It is not only cash that this government has made available, but other matters such as health services and Medicare, and these have been of great help to the less fortunate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the following matter of public importance that Senator Short has put to the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Keating government's policies which have widened the gap between rich and poor and entrenched a permanent underclass in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>I have found it fascinating to sit here and listen to the contributions to this debate from the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and the Greens. They all say that that is not necessarily so. One has only to go out into the real world and ask the mums and dads and single people out there whether they are better or worse off today than they were a decade ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are so many who would scream from the rooftops, `Yes, I am worse off,' that it is staggering to think that this government still does not understand not only the cause, but the effects of its policies. One has only to look at the fact that there are people out there getting wage increases&mdash;yes, they are getting wage increases&mdash;but what this government has done through its direct, intentional policies over the last decade is to increase bracket creep at the rate of knots. That simply means that one gets an increase in pay but the take-home pay is not substantially more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, this government has ensured that it has increased indirect taxes such as sales tax and fuel tax. People who have had a wage increase, particularly the low income earners, have found that hidden tax increases&mdash;which this government will not talk about&mdash;are diluting that increase. The fact that those opposite have the gall to come in here, day in and day out, and say that they have not created a permanent underclass is nothing short of a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health, Senator Crowley, `What about the increase in youth suicide?' She did not have a clue what was going on but stated in her answer, not once but seven times, that the government was concerned about it. Whacky-doo! The government is concerned about it! The question is, what is it going to do about it? I ask that in the same way I ask the question, `What are you going to do to prevent this creeping underclass that is coming into Australia?' The gap has widened, the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. The government will not bite the bullet and do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proportion of the population aged 16 years and over which is dependent on the main direct government pensions and benefits has almost doubled in the last two decades. What are those opposite doing about it? The answer is nothing. Over the last two decades participation by men aged between 55 and 64 years in the full-time labour force declined from 79 per cent to 52 per cent. We had nearly 80 per cent of men over 55 in the work force only two decades ago and now there are just 50 per cent. What is the ramification?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the factors influencing that decline include deterioration of labour market prospects for older workers and the increased availability and attractiveness of non-labour sources of income such as government pensions. But what this country cannot afford is to take those experienced workers out of the work force and have the whole work force suffer as a consequence. What we are doing is robbing Australia of that experience and that valuable asset; we are robbing individuals and families of self-generated income security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have widened the gap between the rich and the poor in the older community. We should be encouraging people to have more income at the older end, not to have less income. It has become a greater problem as time goes on. People should not feel that they are on the employment scrap heap at the age of 55; but, sadly, many people are finding in reality that, thanks to this government's policies, they are on the scrap heap in their early 40s. That has created a massive underclass because we have younger people in their 40s with young families not being able to provide the type of lifestyle that they should be able to provide. They are not providing for their own security as they get older because they have been consigned to the scrap heap by this government. That is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the ABS social trends statement said, inequality in the distribution of earnings of adult full-time employees has increased in the last decade. This government is saying that that gap has not widened. How can it say that with a straight face when the Australian Bureau of Statistics has proven what people in the real world know&mdash;that their disposable income has simply drifted away. The poor have got poorer and the rich have got richer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The terms of reference of this study, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AFTA: Trading Bloc or Building Bloc?</EMPHASIS>, look mainly at the economic impact on Australia, and generally at some of the wider questions of the direction of trade in the region. As stated in the summary, AFTA's principal objective is to boost ASEAN's attractiveness to foreign investors as a base for export production. This is more or less the goal of most nations who feel the wish or need to participate in a deregulated global economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impacts on Australia are expected to be minimal. In part, this is because the primary products that are a major component of our exports to the region are excluded from the agreement, so there will be almost no change there. The negative aspects of the preferential system are expected to be balanced by increased demand as the ASEAN economies grow. A sub-note here is that minimal impact and a balancing of factors does not augur well for a massive expansion in our food exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area that is expected to be hit most heavily by the preferential tariffs is on elaborately transformed manufactures or ETMs. This is the area the government has said it wishes to be growing in, since it involves high levels of value adding and the use of technological skills as an alternative to simple food processing. I note that AFTA does not seem to hold out any great hopes of massively increased exports, and further note that in this area we are in direct competition with Canada and the USA, both of which are members of APEC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flow of investment was considered difficult to quantify. If we look at chapter 5, we see something of the trends relating to TNCs or transnational corporations&mdash;and I use the Australian acronym rather than the US MNCs or multinational corporations. Chapter 5 says that TNCs:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . agree that Asia would be the primary new investment site for their companies in the 1990s</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to highlight some of the positive and negative factors on investment. Due to shortage of time I will call attention to only some factors. One of these, on page 78, is the absence of suitable acquisition partners. I note the statement that there are only a few good partners out there and everyone of them already has multiple tie-ups with other transnational corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note this as part of our general concerns about economic deregulation and so-called free trade. It is clear from this that a major impact of transnational corporation investment, to the extent that it becomes a problem for TNCs themselves, is the creation of an elite and the support of elites in ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to do what most of this book does and take the economic interests of the nation as equivalent to the interests of the people of that nation. While there may be some benefits that trickle down, there is significant evidence that the consequence of development has often been a trickle up&mdash;sometimes even a flow up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What becomes clear in reading this study, and other studies like it, is that the primary factor here is corporate profitability. Where there is under-utilised plant in developed countries, transnational corporations will use that if it is cheaper. If it is not, they will move. There is no responsibility to anyone, and corporate decisions respond as much to corporate factors as to incentives and disincentives set up by nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere in this study or others like it is there any question or term of reference about the impact of leading national economies waiting on the will of transnational corporations. Nowhere are social or environmental impacts mentioned at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in ASEAN a vast expansion of wealth, and the creation of a very rich elite. We see workers in nations like Thailand working for $20 a week. We see the need for competitiveness translate in nations like Thailand to moves to hold wages down, so they can compete against Vietnam. There are huge disparities of wealth and poverty in these nations, and peace is often kept through the use of military and paramilitary force, and the stringency of need. Free trade exacerbates this as long as social and environmental impacts are excluded from consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The freer our trade the more directly we compete with these nations. Without any social and environmental frameworks, we compete on the basis of exploitation of people and the environment. We may have a big future as a food provider to Asia, although this report casts some doubt about the prospects for this short term. Already technological goods are being produced in these nations. Korean-made electronic goods have largely supplanted Japanese ones except at the top end of the market. The Chinese have already taken the bottom end of the electronic market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is another question mark hanging over our future. There is nothing wrong with trade, except when it allows the rich and powerful to circumvent a nation's attempt to look after the welfare of its population. Without regulation, free trade does this. As mentioned in the MPI, there is a growing gap between rich and poor here. It is largely due to unregulated economics and social irresponsibility. We do not see AFTA as any benefit to the people of any nation unless the nations within it take their responsibilities to their people and the environment seriously.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson's bill seeks to exempt from tax all two-wheel drive vehicles used on farms. I believe it will not make too much difference to the federal government budget in terms of imported vehicles. I certainly commend the bill. After all, it virtually extends the situation so that a two-wheel vehicle can be used in the ways provided for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most potent aspect of this bill is the fact that it will include the same capacity utility that is manufactured in Australia&mdash;in other words, the vehicle better known by its original name, `utility'. Only 12 months ago I read that the coupe utility, as we know it, was invented in Australia. A lady wrote to Ford in 1926 saying she wanted a vehicle to enable her to attend church on Sundays and take the pigs to market on Thursdays. I believe Ford came up with such a vehicle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the sales tax exemption is extended to two-wheel drive vehicles, provided they are mainly used on a farm and for allied works, then Australian made utilities could be included. Of course, there are some very good Australian made utilities&mdash;namely, the Ford and the Holden. There may be others I do not know about, but they are the main ones. If such vehicles are brought into this exemption, people would be encouraged to buy Australian produced vehicles. On that basis alone I believe this bill should succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present 21 per cent sales tax is payable. Today I took out a comparison between the cost of two-wheel drive vehicles and the cost of four-wheel drive vehicles, one with sales tax and one without. If one takes a diesel Toyota Hilux utility as a standard sort of vehicle, one sees that a 4x2 utility before tax is priced at $21,596. There is $3,404 tax on that, so to buy one of those vehicles would cost $25,000. Going to the diesel 4x4, I discovered that such a vehicle is priced at $27,916 without sales tax. With sales tax of $4,450, the price goes to $32,000. So there is a difference of roughly $7,466.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the sales tax away from the two-wheel drive vehicle, a two-wheel drive could be sold to the farmer for $21,596 instead of $27,916, which is the price of a 4x4&mdash;a difference of $6,000-odd. This would not encourage a farmer to go for a bigger or heavier vehicle than is considered to be necessary. It is all very well to have a four-wheel drive vehicle, but why pay the extra if one does not need such a vehicle? Without the sales tax on the four-wheel drive and without the sales tax on the two-wheel drive&mdash;$25,000 for a two-wheel drive with sales tax and $27,916 for a four-wheel drive without sales tax&mdash;there is only a difference of $2,000-odd between one and the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a salesman might say, `For that difference you may as well buy the heavier one.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The heavier one is all very well if one needs it, but the heavier vehicle needs more maintenance, because it uses more fuel and tyres wear out more quickly. So a farmer is encouraged to buy a heavier vehicle than he might need. He may need a heavier vehicle; for instance, on our place we use some heavier ones and some lighter ones. If a person needs a heavier one, he will buy it, but for the person who is happy to have the lighter one, there is a big differential and he will buy the light one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind how many of these vehicles are used on farms around Australia, I fully support the move by Senator Watson to get this legislation passed by the Senate. As I said, it will not make any material difference to the number of imported vehicles sold, but it will make a big difference to the number of Australian vehicles sold, because I can see a swing from these imported two-wheel drive vehicles back to the Australian made. I commend Senator Watson's bill and hope it has the support of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will support the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) (Two Wheel Drive Vehicles with Jeep, Platform, Pick-up or Utility Body Type) Amendment Bill 1994. The bill seeks to extend the sales tax exemption on four-wheel drive jeeps and utilities to two-wheel drive jeeps and utilities. Currently, the tax law has two exemptions from sales tax on vehicles. The first is a fairly narrow one&mdash;any motor vehicles used exclusively in primary production on farming premises; secondly, four-wheel drive vehicles with a body type of a jeep, platform, pick-up or utility used in carrying out activities in the agricultural industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is aimed at the second exemption, to extend it also to two-wheel drive jeeps. It rests on two arguments as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned: firstly, that two-wheel drive vehicles are of as much use on a farm as four-wheel drive vehicles and have, in addition, the advantage of lower fuel consumption, which is something we would be interested in. The second argument is one that touches on our automotive industries: all four-wheel drive vehicles are imported, whereas both Ford and GMH in Australia are manufacturing a considerable number of two-wheel drive utilities. </PARA>

When senators and members of the other place put an effort into taking an initiative under that opening, they are entitled, in my view, to receive a considered reply from the government.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we are saying that this legislation would apply to farmers and to contractors on farms. The first thing I say is that one has to be careful when approaching tax measures from an industry assistance point of view. Trying to provide particular assistance to industry by restructuring the tax law is a hazardous undertaking at the best of times. One may look at a settled body of law and disturb it in some way in order to provide a particular benefit, which may well be a benefit that is properly and sensibly thought through. Even if that is the case, it is frequently found that by doing that a loophole is opened up elsewhere that was not intended and a further anomaly is created, which can be an injustice and an inequity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As a threshold point, when approaching issues of this nature, one has to do so with white gloves, long tongs and great care, because disturbing tax law is fraught with the difficulty of opening avenues for tax avoidance. I therefore come to the major argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underpinning this legislation is the view that it will somehow help the Australian automobile industry by ensuring that two-wheel drive vehicles may be purchased in greater numbers from the manufacturing section of that industry by farmers and contractors working on farms. I think that view&mdash;which, I note, was reflected by Senator Spindler&mdash;is challengeable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Industry, Science and Technology has advised the tax office of a cost comparison on utilities&mdash;the sort of two-wheel drive vehicles that farmers would purchase&mdash;sourced in and out of Australia. For vehicles of this type sourced out of Australia, principally from Japan, there is a cost advantage&mdash;it varies according to make and style&mdash;of between $6,000 and $8,000 per vehicle. If the benefit contained in this bill were provided, rather than achieving the objective of helping the Australian manufacturing industry, it may achieve the unintended objective of helping the Japanese manufacturing industry because of the cost competitiveness of Japanese utilities over the Australian product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter to bear in mind is the amount of revenue garnered by the government from sales tax. Sales tax is an important tax levied by the government and the transport section of the sales tax revenue stream is the largest and most important. It is true that it is an input cost; nonetheless, it is a substantial tax and one that the government intends to keep in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure would open a new loophole in that area of taxation, causing a reduction in income. No-one is talking about how revenue would be made up if it were lost in this area. Since we need a predictable amount of revenue to deal with budgetary considerations, the government would regard interference with such an important revenue stream as unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of contractors also arises. As I understand it, under this proposed legislation contractors who work on farms would be entitled to claim the tax concession for their vehicles as farmers would. These contractors may well work part of their time on farms and part elsewhere; clearly, the majority of their time would need to be spent working on farms. Many of these small contractors who do farming, spraying or other agricultural work use their vehicles for different types of contractual work away from the farm. Given their access to this tax concession, they would have an advantage over competitors in off-farm businesses without access to this tax concession. In our view, that would be an unfair competitive advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as industry assistance measures are concerned, the automobile industry is a core industry for Australia. The government recognises it as being fundamental to the continuance of a wide and growing industry base in manufacturing. We recognise it as being central to our development plans for the future and to the growth of the export of elaborately transformed manufactures. It is an important industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in place ongoing discussions with the automotive industry and all the major production houses in Australia. We have in place considerations about how input costs for them can be reduced. That seems to me to be the most sensible way to go if industry development initiatives are foremost in our minds rather than changing the tax arrangements. For all these reasons, and while acknowledging the initiative taken here, the government declines support for this bill. </PARA>

If this bill has does nothing more than pick up that issue, it has been a success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging from the debate, there is no doubt that this bill will pass this chamber. Therefore, I would also like to acknowledge the support that we have had from the Greens. With their support, plus the support of the Democrats, this bill will certainly pass this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the discussion that this bill has initiated will make the government acknowledge the role of the manufacturing industry and the problems confronting our producers. They feel that they can compete with these imported vehicles. As we know, there is always a problem with Japan because it tends to price its products at a price which the market will bear rather than relating it to cost. We must bear that in mind otherwise we end up with an artificial view of the impact of trading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of my bill is very simple: it aims to ensure fairness and equity in the application of sales tax to vehicles which are used mainly in the agricultural industry. We believe that there is an anomaly in the current legislation which discriminates unfairly against two-wheel drive vehicles over four-wheel drive vehicles. My motivation is that Australian manufacturers are feeling the full brunt of this discrimination since they have returned to the production of these sorts of vehicles, the one-tonners, which essentially fulfil the role&mdash;except in the mud and on high inclines&mdash;of four-wheel drive vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My bill seeks to extend the sales tax exemption currently applying to four-wheel drive vehicles to two-wheel drive vehicles of the same body type and used for the same purpose in the agricultural industry. Under the existing legislation, two-wheel drive vehicles, including those manufactured by Ford and General Motors, are hit with a 21 per cent tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restriction of the sales tax exemption to four-wheel drive vehicles can no longer be justified. It originated from Treasury's view that only four-wheel drive vehicles have the specifications which categorise them as specially suitable for agricultural purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Senate that this view is no longer tenable or appropriate. The whole purpose of the bill is fairness and equity. Through a massive ongoing development program to upgrade the quality and capacity of commercial vehicles, locally manufactured two-wheel drive utilities produced by Ford in particular now have performance capabilities that equal those of most four-wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry. The effect of the anomalous treatment of two-wheel drive vehicles is that serious distortions have occurred in buying patterns within the rural sector. This bill removes these serious distortions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the exemptions, four-wheel drive vehicles can be purchased at virtually two-wheel drive vehicle prices. I thank Senator Panizza for providing the figures that show this position so clearly. In the financial impact section we acknowledge that there will be loss of revenue. Often when we seek to remove anomalies to correct things there is some loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is more important? Are we just revenue driven in this country, or do we have some sense of fairness and equity in trying to balance these things out? My private member's bill does not limit the extension of the exemption only to locally produced vehicles. The bill does not discriminate against foreign two-wheel drive vehicles. However, I must say that a lot of the people who have supported the bill hoped that I had tried to do that. Of course, in that event we would have run into some GATT problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My bill makes two-wheel drive vehicles used mainly in the agricultural industry cheaper by several thousand dollars. Two-wheel drive vehicles will become more price competitive with imported four-wheel drive vehicles, and this will lead to an increase in demand for two-wheel drive vehicles&mdash;particularly the locally produced ones&mdash;despite the arguments put by Senator Cook and his department that essentially the imported vehicles would have a price advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out the existing discriminatory position. I suppose that is one of the very many reasons why investment is lacking in this country. It is true that in some sectors demand is picking up, but the problem is investment. We are facing a major problem in this country. Yesterday, I was disturbed to read that overseas investors are pulling out of manufacturing investment in Australia. This is not a good sign. In other words, overseas investors are increasingly lacking confidence in putting their money into manufacturing activities in Australia. This is a challenge that Senator Collins has to face as the Minister for Primary Industries. I would have liked to have heard Senator Cook speak with his industry, technology and science hat on today; we might have got a different type of response. Unfortunately, Senator Cook is representing the hard-headed Treasurer. We acknowledge that there is a loss of revenue in terms of sales tax and customs. We are quite open about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Cook to look at the reasons why investment is lacking. Small manufacturers are still recovering from the recession and they are still trying to get their balance sheets right. Because of pressure from the banks they are not being allowed to go into investment activities until their balance sheets are right. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fully concur with the committee's finding that our relationship with Indonesia is open and positive, and in better condition than it has been for some years, but more can be done to improve it. Australians and Indonesians can and should work together to develop a relationship which goes even further in meeting the needs of both countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia under President Suharto has experienced political stability, rapid economic growth, new prosperity for Indonesians, and leadership in international affairs. Recent changes in Australia are no less remarkable. We have had to make our economy more competitive, efficient, and skilled. We are realising the full significance of our geography and giving unprecedented attention to the region in which we live. We are discovering the comparative advantage of multiculturalism in our dealings with Asia. We are debating a new sense of national identity and direction. In all these areas, this government has been a driving force for change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Indonesia and Australia redefine their places in the world, particularly in the region, prospects for greater dealings between us become more and more evident. We have a heightened sense of shared interests. Economic reform in both countries has thrown up complementarities stimulating greater commercial dealings. A perception of shared interests beyond the bilateral level is prompting our work together on regional security and prosperity. In short, we are poised to take on new opportunities with Indonesia. The environment is right, and the time is right. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Progress so far</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My government knows this and has been working towards the challenge. In a few years we have turned perceptions of shared interests into concrete programs for cooperation. We have developed a close rapport at the highest levels of the Indonesian government, in a range of fields. Australian and Indonesian ministers are beating an increasingly well worn path to each other's doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two governments are developing a solid institutional framework in which to explore ways of delivering long-term benefits. Agreements have been signed on matters as diverse as investment, taxation, copyright, education, customs, development assistance, and fisheries cooperation. We are negotiating an agreement on science and technology cooperation. Our officials have regular exchanges in the fields of education, science and technology, health, customs and primary industry, to name just a few examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australia Indonesia Ministerial Forum, which is particularly directed at giving government impetus to economic ties, is our most significant bilateral arrangement. Since the establishment of this forum by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and President Suharto in 1992, government and business representatives have regularly met to identify areas for commercial collaboration and to address impediments to trade and investment. Business missions under the aegis of the forum have already resulted in tangible commercial outcomes. We take careful note of the committee's recommendation to exploit fully the potential of this forum, and will be doing our best to take the process forward at the next forum meeting in Canberra in August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of these institutional links is not haphazard. We have worked consciously to put them in place, and see them as the foundation stones of a stable and enduring relationship. I welcome the committee's recognition of their value and its recommendation that they be strengthened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The web of ties is being woven beyond government as well. Australia's business community is becoming engaged in Indonesia at a rate we welcome but would like to see further improved. In five years our exports to Indonesia have trebled to reach $1.8 billion; within that, manufactures exports have more than trebled to reach $766 million. We are Indonesia's 10th largest source of investment, with over 180 Australian companies now operating there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In people-to-people links, there is also a quiet revolution under way, again supported by government. The Australia-Indonesia Institute spent over $1 million in 1993-94 on cross-cultural studies and exchanges in the professional, cultural, youth and sports fields. We would welcome closer involvement by the Indonesian government in stimulating ties at this level, and I wholeheartedly support the committee's recommendation that we encourage Indonesia to establish a counterpart to the Australia-Indonesia Institute. We have been doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We firmly believe in the value of grassroots cooperation and understanding. We have also demonstrated our commitment in this respect by allocating $48 million over the next four years to the study of Asian languages, including Indonesian, in primary and secondary schools through our national Asian languages studies initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The activities I have outlined bring tangible benefits for Australians. They also help cement a bedrock of understanding between the two countries&mdash;an understanding which can be drawn on when dealing with the problems which are bound to arise from time to time. As the committee notes, Australia and Indonesia do not always see eye to eye. Our relationship is not always comfortable, and the committee has reported frankly on areas where we have differed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most sensitive area of our relationship is in the field of human rights, where we often register our concerns at the highest levels of the Indonesian government. We do not apologise for doing so. As a democratic government we wish, and indeed are obliged, to represent community concerns, including in our foreign policy. But, importantly, we believe that the concerns and issues we raise reflect not just our own values, but those of the entire international community as evidenced in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and related instruments and as recently reaffirmed at last year's Vienna Conference on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are mindful of the need to ensure that these representations are effective, and we believe they are most likely to be so if Australia is seen as a constructive interlocutor on human rights issues, in the context of a strong and broadly-based relationship. We share the committee's conclusion that human rights issues should neither be submerged in the relationship nor be allowed to dominate it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, we shall continue, as we have done for some years, to argue for a commitment by the Indonesian government to reconciliation with the people of East Timor&mdash;through achieving a major reduction and refocusing of the role of the military, giving the fullest possible recognition to East Timor's distinctive cultural identity, engaging in sensitive economic development, and also, hopefully, enabling a significant degree of local autonomy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia and Indonesia have often found ways creatively to work through difficulties together. The Timor Gap treaty is an outstanding example of an innovative approach to what seemed an insoluble problem, addressing as it does the issue of undefined boundaries by creating a framework in which we could jointly explore for, and develop resources for, the benefit of both our countries. We must be similarly creative in those areas of our relationship which need more attention. We still have some way to go, for example, in addressing the problem of illegal fishing. The government appreciates the committee's detailed consideration of fisheries matters and acknowledges its concerns. We support the recommendation to keep the issue of illegal fishing under review. The fisheries cooperation agreement allows us to consult effectively on this and other fisheries matters of common concern. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has seen for itself the growing knowledge of, and interest in, Indonesia by Australians, and that we are poised to enter a new phase in our relations. We can build on our gains so far, and we must take advantage of the momentum for taking forward the relationship which now exists. The imperative to strengthen and diversify our commercial ties is foremost. For this reason we are taking government cooperation with business to new levels. Later this month Senator McMullan will lead a mission of up to 250 Australian companies to a business forum in Jakarta to be opened by the Prime Minister. Participants will discuss Indonesia's trade and investment prospects with an array of Indonesia's most influential business representatives. This is the largest business mission to have travelled overseas from Australia at any one time, and its outcome will substantially affect deliberations in Canberra this August on how best to use the Australia-Indonesia Ministerial Forum to advance our commercial agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These commercial objectives will be enhanced by our work with Indonesia on regional economic and trade liberalisation. We will continue to work closely together to ensure the success of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation process, and do all we can to support Indonesia's chairmanship of APEC this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security of our regional environment remains a priority, and we will be enhancing our engagement with Indonesia on political and security issues in this region. We continue to share a commitment to Cambodia. We need to, and will, talk further about developments in Burma-Myanmar and ways of achieving its more responsible involvement in regional and international affairs. Indonesia is a key player in the regional security dialogue that is now emerging, in particular through the new ASEAN regional forum which we will be attending together when it meets for the first time in Bangkok in July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A positive defence relationship with Indonesia is crucial to our strategic partnership with the region. We will strengthen our dialogue on defence and security, increase practical cooperation such as exercises, training, and study visits, and explore opportunities for defence industry collaboration. We will continue to place particular importance on professional and personal relationships between members of our defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our development assistance program, worth for Indonesia around $140 million in 1994-95, further underscores our commitment to this country. We remain strongly interested in the humanitarian and development aspirations of its people. In line with the Indonesian government's priorities, Eastern Indonesia will remain a focus of our development cooperation. Such cooperation should stimulate Australian commercial activity, entrenching Australia's stake in Indonesia while assisting local economic development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this agenda we have added a further task, that of encouraging Indonesians towards a more complete understanding of Australia. In the next few days a major Australian promotion will commence in Indonesia, Australia Today: Indonesia 94. The Prime Minister inaugurated this promotion at the Australian end from Sydney in March this year. On 14 June I will formally open the promotion in Jakarta: joined by Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Industry and Trade, Mr Hartarto&mdash;himself a graduate of the University of NSW&mdash;who has agreed to act as patron. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia Today: Indonesia 94 is the largest promotion of its kind undertaken by Australia. It is a combined effort between government, business and Australians from all the fields of activity we are seeking to promote.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIA'S RELATIONS WITH INDONESIA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Government's Response to the Report by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade presented by Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign Affairs</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">INTRODUCTION</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 5 June 1991, seeking formal referral of the terms of reference for an inquiry into Australia's relations with Indonesia, the Government welcomed this initiative as appropriate recognition of Indonesia's importance to Australia. Not only is Indonesia Australia's largest, most populous neighbour, but our relationship with Indonesia is a vital part of our engagement with Asia and critical to the success of our diplomacy in the region. Our relations with Indonesia provide a springboard for closer involvement in South East Asia, strategically and economically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government attaches the highest priority to the continued development of Australia's relations with Indonesia and, over the past five years, both the Australian and Indonesian Governments have made a conscious effort to develop practical links between our two countries. The Government, therefore, warmly welcomes the Committee's Report, and is most appreciative of the Committee's work in drawing attention to the depth and complexity of Australia's relations with Indonesia, and the positive recommendations that it makes for broadening the relationship still further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Report has highlighted the Australian community's wide-ranging interest in Indonesia. The Report has generated public discussion on the many strands in Australia-Indonesia relations and drawn these together in an extensive picture of the ties between the two countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government particularly welcomes the Committee's conclusion that the future is very promising for our two countries to work together in a harmonious way. At the same time, the Government acknowledges the Committee's conclusion that a great deal can still be done to strengthen the relationship, particularly in terms of increasing Australian trade and investment with Indonesia. The Government agrees with the Committee that it must work closely with the business community to ensure that businesses are kept informed of the emerging opportunities in Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made thirty six recommendations, covering a diverse range of issues, including regional issues, defence links, human rights issues, fisheries, minerals and energy, further development of education and cultural links, trade and investment strategies and development assistance. The following are the Government's detailed responses to each of the recommendations put forward by the Committee. All government departments and agencies with an interest in the issues raised by the Committee were consulted in the preparation of these responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATIONS AND RESPONSES</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government encourage the Indonesian Government to abide by the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its regular discussions with the Indonesian Government on sea law issues, the Australian Government routinely conveys its expectation that the Indonesian Government will respect international navigation rights such as those set down in the provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the Convention) including the archipelagic provisions set out in Part IV of that Convention. With respect to the question of the right of passage through international straits and archipelagic waters, the Australian Government will continue to make clear its view that, while now reflected in the provisions of the Convention, the right of such passage exists independently of the Convention as a general right at international law. Australia has consistently supported the regime for archipelagic states set down in the Convention because it elaborates rights and obligations which constitute a fair balance between the requirements of archipelagic states on the one hand and the navigation interests of the international community on the other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent comments of Indonesian officials indicate the generally positive approach Indonesia takes towards the Convention. For example, on 9 December 1993, the Indonesian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Mr Nugroho Wisnumurti, acknowledged the importance of a unified legal regime of the seas to Indonesia's national ocean policy as an archipelagic state and affirmed Indonesia's commitment to bring its national legislation into harmony with the obligations contained in the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted in this context that the sixtieth ratification of the Convention was deposited on 16 November 1993 and, in accordance with its terms, the Convention will enter into force twelve months from that date i.e. on 16 November 1994. Until entry into force, Indonesia and Australia are under an obligation under Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties to refrain from acts which would defeat the purpose of the Convention. Clearly, however, Australia will be in an even stronger position to ensure Indonesia abides by the provisions of the Convention if both countries are Parties. This fact reinforces a number of arguments in favour of Australia taking steps to ratify the Convention once outstanding issues relating to the Convention's seabed mining regime have been resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that current discussions about regional security continue and expand, with the object of working towards the creation of a cooperative regional defence structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation that current discussions on regional security continue and increase. Significant progress has already been made in this area, most importantly the decision at the 1993 ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) and  the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) to establish the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) as a region-wide vehicle for discussions on Asia Pacific security. The Australian Government actively supported the establishment of a forum for multilateral Asia-Pacific regional security dialogue and welcomed the decision to include Russia, Vietnam, Laos, China and PNG in the ARF. The first ARF will take place in July this year in Bangkok, immediately prior to the 1994 PMC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has also proposed the initiation of a bilateral officials' level dialogue in security and disarmament matters. The first exchange will take place in June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that, when major equipment purchases are being finalised:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where possible, discussions be held in advance with regional countries to ensure the purposes of these acquisitions are explained; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">such purchases are announced in formal statements to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key objective of Australia's policy of regional defence engagement is to reduce the potential for misunderstanding or tension to emerge in the region by promoting greater openness of regional countries on strategic planning and force structure issues, including prospective major equipment acquisitions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In dialogue with regional countries Australia has sought to encourage this openness and itself has one of the most open strategic and force structure processes in the region. In recent years, the Australian Government has published a number of defence planning documents which identify the kinds of capabilities which Australia is planning to acquire and the priorities attached to these. Such documents include strategic assessments (Strategic Review 1993 and Australia's Strategic Planning in the 1990s) and guidance on defence policy and force structuring processes (1987 Defence of Australia White Paper and 1991 Force Structure Review).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition Australia maintains regular dialogue with regional countries on a range of security issues, including strategic and force structure planning processes. For the first time, in the course of  preparing the 1993 Strategic Review, the Review team visited regional countries including Indonesia to develop a better understanding of regional perspectives and interests. These kinds of discussions are consistent with our efforts to encourage greater transparency in defence planning processes in the region as a means of enhancing regional security. A new Defence White Paper is in preparation for release later this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information is readily available on Australia's acquisition and approval processes. Proposed defence equipment acquisitions are generally made public through the budgeting and approval process, which includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence New Major Capital Equipment Proposals (The Pink Book), a chronologically ordered list of proposals for new equipment and their expenditure spreads, which provides an orderly five year projection of decision points, expenditure patterns and total cost of proposed acquisitions.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence review the appropriateness of training provided to Indonesian military personnel to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">training in international standards of human rights behaviour is provided as an integral part of the defence cooperation program; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">training which is provided is directed towards the acquisition of operational military skills and not those which should more appropriately be given to civil police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal areas of our cooperative defence activities with Indonesia incorporate, both directly and indirectly, human rights issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights aspects of the training provided by the Australian Defence Force (ADF) to Indonesian military personnel are directly related to human rights education within the ADF itself. Human rights and humanitarian issues are an integral part of a comprehensive training approach for all ADF personnel. The two main areas of human rights training in the ADF are training in international humanitarian law (with an emphasis on the Law of Armed Conflict) and awareness of appropriate workplace attitudes and behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indonesian students participating in ADF courses receive, as do all foreign students, the same periods of instruction regarding international humanitarian law as their ADF counterparts. This training is designed to improve leadership skills, to impart professional and technical expertise, and generally to create a more effective atmosphere for cooperation in external defence activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, Indonesian military personnel during training with or attachment to the ADF are exposed to the ethos of the ADF, and Australian values in general, and towards issues of conscience, including human rights. Current directives also require operational units to include such training in ADF exercises. In-country professional and technical training provided by ADF personnel, which incorporates Law of Armed Conflict and human rights elements as appropriate, is also included.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ADF does not provide training or undertake other cooperative activities with the Indonesian Armed Forces in skills designed to enhance internal security or counter-insurgency capability. The limited cooperation that has occurred between the ADF and Indonesia Special Forces (KOPASSUS) forms a very small part of the wider defence relationship with Indonesia. The limited cooperation with KOPASSUS in 1993 focused on low-level military war-fighting skills, with only basic familiarisation training being conducted. Activities of the Indonesian troop in Australia included communications, small arms range practice, medical training, water work and rope work. These skills focus on improving the ability of Indonesian Special Forces in war-fighting activities such as would be undertaken against an external enemy. Such skills are an established part of normal Special Forces operations. Special Forces training with KOPASSUS has also taken place  in 1994. A team of SAS soldiers trained in Indonesia in basic military skills, while at the same time a group of Indonesian soldiers used special purpose training facilities in Perth for counter&mdash;hijack training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade examine, in conjunction with such bodies as the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau and the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, the provision of defence and defence-related assistance to Indonesia to ensure that an appropriate, formal level of consultation exists for effective and efficient delivery of that assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other relevant organisations should continue to consult as necessary regarding defence-related activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A primary aim of co-operative activities is the building of personal and professional links between each defence organisation, in order to maintain and consolidate the overall defence relationship between Australia and Indonesia. Such activities are not organised as aid. Their purpose is to further the goals of the defence relationship. Some of them, however, such as language training for military personnel and mapping, have benefits beyond the defence area and can be reported internationally as more general development assistance. There are good working level contacts between the Department of Defence and AIDAB and there is an exchange of information and experience relevant to Australia-Indonesia defence activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Defence consult regularly on </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">cooperative defence matters including between Defence and Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade personnel at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Concerning Defence consultation with the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, coordination between Defence (Directorate of Survey-Army) and the AGSO already occurs both informally and formally. On a formal level, both the AGSO and Defence have representatives on the Commonwealth Spatial Data Committee and its various sub-committees. This Committee discusses, among other things, the survey work carried out by relevant Australian organisations in other countries. This ensures that the activities in each country are coordinated and no unnecessary overlap occurs. The Directorate of Survey&mdash;Army is aware of the survey activity that has been done by AGSO in Irian Jaya and understands that there is no overlap between AGSO's activities and the work of Defence. On an informal basis, officers of the Directorate of Survey&mdash;Army are in regular contact with AGSO personnel as the need arises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government respond positively to any request it might receive from the Indonesian Government to assist in reviews of its legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has an interest in developing closer links with Indonesia in areas of law of mutual interest to both countries. Our willingness and ability to provide assistance to regional Governments has been demonstrated on many occasions. For example, the Attorney-General's Department has been co-operatively involved with a number of regional Governments (including Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Pacific Island nations) in relation to the modernisation of their laws and the practical operations of their legal systems. AIDAB also supports legal development programs e.g. a portfolio of projects in Vietnam worth $5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to Indonesia, the Deputy Chief Justice of the Indonesian Supreme Court visited the Attorney-General's Department in November 1993 for an exchange of ideas on the respective legal systems and to familiarise himself with Australia's legal system. In addition, the visit to Australia in December 1993 by Mr Saleh Baharis, the Director-General of Legal Affairs of the Indonesian Ministry of Justice, has expanded contacts in law and legal education between Australia and Indonesia. The purpose of Mr Baharis's visit was to enable him to examine the Australian approach to the regulation of securities markets and to business and commercial law policy issues generally. The visit was planned and coordinated by the International Legal Services Advisory Council (ILSAC) and the Attorney-General's Department. ILSAC proposes to focus part of its work program over the next two to three years on activities to encourage closer links in law between Australia and Indonesia at the government, university and private level. This includes cooperating with the Australian Embassy in Jakarta to organise a one day seminar on 28 June 1994 which will take place under the umbrella of the Australia Today Indonesia 94 promotion. The work of the Australia Indonesia Institute and its Legal Affairs Sub Committee is also important in the process of encouraging closer links between Australia and Indonesia in law and legal education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During his visit, Mr Baharis indicated that the process of legal reform in Indonesia is mapped out over the next 25 years, with a specific legislative program over the next five years, especially in the area of commercial law. The issue of assistance in legal matters is not only a sensitive one, but one in which the Indonesian authorities have reasonably clear ideas of the matters with which they require assistance and of the areas in which they might be prepared to consider assistance. They are also particularly interested to identify the areas where we may be able to provide assistance before this will be considered by them as an option. A further issue is whether or not the area of law being discussed is politically neutral.  Our response to a request for assistance would be to consider it actively based upon informed discussion with our Indonesian counterparts (at Ministerial and officials level) on the substance of their needs, what we may be able to provide by way of assistance and what we are prepared, or able, to provide by way of assistance if such is requested.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDAB has been approached to provide assistance with training in legislative drafting. An AIDAB short term training mission visited Indonesia in January-February 1994 and examined opportunities for Australia to provide `tailor-made' training programs in key sectors and  discussions were held with the Indonesian Ministry of Justice and other legal bodies to jointly determine priorities. It was agreed that aspects of commercial law, including Intellectual Property Rights, should be targeted for assistance. Discussions will also be held with the  National Development Planning Board (BAPPENAS) and the Cabinet Secretariat which will help determine the priority for training in this sector compared with other competing sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government should press for the re&mdash;opening of its consulate in Dili.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes the Report's comments on the merits of an Australian consulate in Dili, on commercial and consular grounds. The Government will seek opportunities at an appropriate time to raise the matter of a consulate with the Indonesian authorities. Any decision to establish a consulate in Dili, however, would need to be considered in the light of the Department's available financial resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Report notes, the Government has actively worked to build links with East Timor, and to assist its development. The level and involvement of Australian aid cooperation in East Timor is steadily increasing.

The workshop focused on human rights and good governance issues in the context of delivering an effective aid program as well as the most practical and effective approach for an operationally focused human rights training program for AIDAB staff.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government continues to encourage the Indonesian Government to pursue strategies for reconciliation in the provinces of Irian Jaya, Aceh and East Timor. In doing so, an emphasis is placed on the need for economic and social development strategies which take account of the cultural sensitivities and particular aspirations of the inhabitants of these provinces, the need for a more sensitive approach by the armed forces in these provinces and a reduction of their presence. The Government also stresses the need for facilitating access to these areas, for example by human rights and humanitarian organisations, parliamentarians and the media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises Indonesian sovereignty over Irian Jaya, Aceh and East Timor. It would therefore be inappropriate for the Government to engage in direct dialogue with representatives of separatist movements.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 12</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General convene a conference of Western Australian, Queensland and Northern Territory Attorneys-General to attempt to standardise the treatment of illegal Indonesian fishermen by different jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation has been accepted by the Government to the extent that the issue of standardisation of the treatment of illegal Indonesian fishermen was on the agenda for discussion at the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General at its meeting on 18 February 1994 in Canberra. The Standing Committee decided that Government officials from the relevant jurisdictions should discuss concerns about the issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of reasons why the treatment accorded to illegal Indonesian fishermen differs depending on their place of apprehension. First, the place of apprehension might fall within one of four different jurisdictions (Commonwealth, Western Australia, Queensland and Northern Territory ). The lack of uniformity in the penalties applied is understandable given that each jurisdiction will have different policies relating to the fixing of penalties. Moreover the jurisdiction dependent differences in penalties and treatment are not confined to illegal fishing. Those differences apply to many other areas of activity and are an inevitable consequence of the Australian federal structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the type of penalty which may be imposed in some maritime areas is restricted by international law. In the area beyond the 12 nautical mile territorial sea Australia is not able to impose imprisonment as a direct penalty for illegal foreign fishing. State legislation (which largely applies within 3 nautical miles of the coast) may provide for an imprisonment as a direct penalty for illegal fishing. However, by reason of the international legal constraint just mentioned, Commonwealth fisheries legislation (which in part applies beyond the territorial sea) does not allow for imprisonment as a penalty for the offence of illegal fishing. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over and above the differences which exist in the maximum penalties between the various States and the Commonwealth, magistrates and judges have a discretion in the level of penalty imposed in each case. The exercise of this discretion in response to the circumstances of each individual offence inevitably leads to differences of penalty even within a single jurisdiction. The Commonwealth would not support the fettering of such discretion. Nor would it support special uniform penalties to be applied only in relation to illegal Indonesian fishing. Such special uniform penalties would be seen as discriminatory either to the illegal fishermen or to the persons who did not have the benefit of these special penalties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the offences committed by illegal Indonesian fishermen are not confined to fisheries offences. Serious customs, quarantine and migration offences may also be involved. These latter offences are Commonwealth offences and uniform maximum penalties apply, though again a magistrate or judge will have a discretion as to the actual level of penalty imposed below that maximum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the differing treatment accorded illegal Indonesian fishermen flows from Australia's federal structure, with State governments regulating fishing in some areas and the Commonwealth regulating fishing in other areas. However, discussions have been held at both Ministerial and officials levels between the Commonwealth and individual states (particularly Western Australia) on the penalties and treatment accorded illegal Indonesian fishermen. Also, as a result of the Committee's report, the  issues raised in Recommendation 12 were placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. As indicated earlier, that Committee decided at its meeting on 18 February 1994 that officials should examine concerns about these issues.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A mechanism has been established to review arrangements for the provision of caretaker services at the Willie Creek detention centre which is located approximately 60 kms from Broome in Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) is responsible for the tendering and management of the centre. The current contract is for a period of 2 years running from 1 September 1993 to 31 August 1995 with provision for full or partial termination if performance is not adequate. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy in conjunction with AFMA will review the operation of the centre at the end of the first year. A similar process is being observed in respect of caretaker arrangements in Darwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 14</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Department of Primary industries and Energy  consider broadening the scope of the Fisheries Cooperation Agreement with Indonesia to consider the relevance of aquaculture research projects and the joint management of maritime resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fisheries Co-operation Agreement already provides scope for research to be undertaken into aquaculture projects. This is provided for under Article 9 of the Agreement which encourages the exchange of information and Co-operation with respect to aquaculture. There are also more general provisions set out under Articles 1 and 4 respectively of the Agreement concerning the facilitation of Co-operation in fisheries research, through exchanges and training of fisheries and marine conservation personnel. Formal consultations with Indonesia are planned for this year and  will provide an opportunity to review the adequacy of the Agreement both from an Indonesian and Australian perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is uncertain, however, whether aquaculture projects would achieve their aim of increasing the level of trochus production in Indonesian waters within a medium-term time frame. There would need to be careful monitoring, surveying and management of any increased trochus resource in Indonesian waters if sustainable production were to be assured. Even if such measures were adopted, it appears that population pressure and the resultant demand for  natural resources will always tend to outstrip supply and Indonesian fisherman can be expected to continue to be attracted to Australian waters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, given that Indonesian fisherman are also attracted to Australian waters to fish for shark and finfish species, research projects aimed at increasing the level of trochus production in Indonesian waters are unlikely to alleviate the problem of illegal Indonesian fishing in the Australian Fishing Zone (AFZ). Over the past twelve months the price of trochus has declined and virtually all recent illegal Indonesian fishing activity has focused on shark and finfish species. The recent accent on illegal fishing for shark and finfish species is thought to be driven also by the generally depleted condition of Indonesian fisheries resources, due in large part to the high levels of foreign fishing activity. As such, traditional and smaller commercial Indonesian fishing operations are seeking better catches in the more prospective AFZ. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Important cultural influences also mean that illegal Indonesian fishing is not purely a market motivated phenomenon affected by the availability of local resources or price factors. The taking of trochus from the more distant AFZ is apparently seen to be an act of manhood of significant cultural and personal importance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aquaculture may alleviate some of these pressures in the longer term and is an option that should be pursued, but at best is likely to have only minimal impact on the pressures which underlie illegal fishing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government strongly supports the development of closer Co-operation with Indonesia on the management of fisheries resources occurring in both the AFZ and Indonesian Exclusive Economic Zone. However, a joint management approach, possibly involving some form of `buffer zone' or `zone of Co-operation', is not considered appropriate or viable given the significant institutional and operational differences that exist between Australia and Indonesia in the management of fisheries resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian industry is also unlikely to benefit from joint management and it is highly unlikely that the status of shared resources would be enhanced. Indonesia already licenses a level of fishing effort by foreign and domestic vessels in the Arafura Sea which fisheries scientists and managers in both countries consider to be excessive and unsustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our preferred model for closer Co-operation with Indonesia is for the development of fisheries management practices, based on the exchange and analysis of data on the shared stocks of the Arafura and Timor Seas and collaborative work on stock assessment and fisheries research for species of common interest. The Joint Australia-Indonesia Workshop on the Shared Stocks of the Arafura Sea, held in Darwin in November 1992, is a good example. At this meeting Indonesia expressed interest in placing such an arrangement on a more formal basis, with annual meetings to address matters of mutual interest and concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until there is a major change in the way Indonesia manages its fisheries, clear delineation of the maritime boundary with complementary, but distinct, management regimes by both countries is the most cost-effective approach. It is also the approach which will result in the best outcomes from a resource management perspective.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following background is relevant to the current fisheries arrangements between Australia and Indonesia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1968 Australia established a 12nm fishing zone, thereby reserving the zone for the exclusive use of fishermen and vessels licensed under Australian law. However, in recognition of  traditional fishing activities and as a good neighbour, Australia agreed that traditional activities could continue in the declared fishing zone and the territorial sea adjacent to Ashmore and Cartier Islands, Seringapatam Reef, Scott Reef, Adele and Browse Islands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significant numbers of Indonesian fishing vessels were subsequently found on or operating in the vicinity of Australia's north-west coast&mdash;some 225 and 198 in 1973/74 and 1974/75 respectively. Following considerable concern over the health and quarantine threat posed by such activity (foot &amp; mouth disease, rabies and Newcastle disease are endemic in Indonesia) the Australian Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, raised the issue with President Suharto in Jakarta in August 1974. Officials then met in Jakarta in November 1974 and settled the terms of the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Indonesia regarding the operations of Indonesian traditional fishermen in areas of the Australian Fishing Zone and Continental Shelf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was agreed that, due to health and quarantine concerns, Indonesian fishermen would no longer be permitted to fish in waters adjacent to the Australian mainland and immediately adjacent to islands, but could do so in waters under Australian jurisdiction adjacent to the off-shore islands and reefs of ashmore, Cartier, Scott and Seringapatam reefs and Browse Island. Additionally, Indonesian fishermen could shelter within these off-shore island and reef complexes, but were not permitted (due to conservation concerns) to go ashore other than to obtain fresh water on the Middle and East Islands of Ashmore Reef. Because Australian health authorities found the wells on the Middle and East Islands of Ashmore Reef to be contaminated by faecal and cholera organisms in 1983, approved access for fresh water was subsequently changed to West Island. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent times, concerns regarding depletion of fisheries resources in the AFZ, threats to the primary industries on the Australian mainland and loss of protected species have continued. Significant numbers of Indonesian fishing vessels, both traditional and non-traditional, continue to operate in waters of the northern and north-western AFZ. The continuing presence reflects the fact that Indonesian fisheries resources are under increasing and, in some areas, unsustainable pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important to note that Australian enforcement authorities usually adopt a flexible and sympathetic attitude in dealing with traditional Indonesian fishing activity within the AFZ. Most vessels apprehended for illegal fishing are non-traditional and are engaged in overtly commercial operations, usually with motors, radio and navigational equipment. Traditional vessels operating outside the terms of the 1974 MOU are usually warned off and directed to those areas where they are permitted access. Due regard is given to their traditional status, their ability to accurately determine their position in the AFZ and the prevailing winds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the need to keep under review the issue of illegal Indonesian fishing and to discuss with Indonesian authorities those aspects requiring clarification and/or modification. Such a review is considered timely given the nature of the issue, recent developments and the need to ensure that the australian response is an effective and appropriate one. It is important to note, however, that the illegal fishing issue is regularly raised with Indonesia during appropriate meetings, including at the Joint Australia-Indonesia Workshop on the Shared Stocks of the Arafura Sea held in Darwin in November 1992 and at the time of Australia-Indonesia Maritime Boundary Delimitation Negotiations in April and October 1993 and, most recently, in May 1994, with the result that both countries have a good understanding of the issue and the constraints under which they are operating. The review would take place under the Fisheries Co-operation agreement which establishes, inter alia, a formal consultative framework to facilitate the resolution of fisheries matters of common concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges the concerns of the Committee regarding the 1974 MOU. It should be noted, however, that Indonesian authorities have recently acknowledged the worth of the MOU. The terms of the MOU reflect a measured response by both countries to circumstances where Australia has sought to balance the needs of traditional Indonesian fishermen with its health and quarantine requirements and requirements for the conservation and management of the Australian Fishing Zone. The terms of the MOU continue to be generally relevant to the needs of the traditional Indonesian fishermen while meeting Australian conservation and management requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the appropriate mechanism for seeking to deal with the problems identified by the Committee is through the existing channels of bilateral consultation rather than through seeking to renegotiate the existing arrangement. Moreover, we consider that neither the Timor Gap Treaty, nor the Torres Strait Treaty with PNG, are appropriate models on which to base revised fisheries arrangements. The former provides for the joint exploration, development and management of offshore petroleum and gas reserves and is not an appropriate model for practical Co-operation in fisheries matters. Fisheries management is significantly different from that of petroleum exploration where minimum standards and operational guidelines can be achieved. The latter provides for the management of overlapping jurisdictions and the rights of Torres Strait islanders to engage in traditional activities. Illegal Indonesian fishing occurs within Australian waters, and the islands affected are not inhabited; nor is there the element of reciprocity which underpins the Torres Strait Treaty.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee commented on changes to the funding and staffing of the Secretariat of the Institute. These changes were based on an assessment by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that the Cultural Relations Branch (CRB)&mdash;now International Cultural Relations Branch&mdash;should no longer bear all the administrative costs of the Institute and other bilateral foundations. These costs had previously been met largely out of the Branch's annual running costs allocation. Like other areas of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Branch has had to absorb, among other things, an annual reduction of 1.25 per cent in its budget as an efficiency dividend. In the circumstances, it was considered only prudent to ensure that costs were shared between the Branch and the foundations, and that all foundations were treated equally in terms of access to Branch funds for administrative purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee raised as a matter of concern the "downgrading" of the Institute Director position, the fact that the Director's position had been vacant since February 1993, and the reduction in the number of dedicated Institute staff from four to two. The Branch has in recent years been faced with continuing budget pressures that have eroded the salaries budget of the Branch.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The frequency at which graduation ceremonies are held is also a factor determining the length of time that passes between submission of a thesis and the receipt of a degree certificate. Many universities now have two or three or more graduation ceremonies during the year. Many include at least one ceremony per year in an overseas country. Such measures reduce the time that successful students must wait to receive their testamurs. Students can also receive their awards in absentia. Additionally, a number of universities have introduced procedures whereby governing councils can award degrees in absentia to successful students in the course of council meetings instead of waiting for a public conferring ceremony.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All universities provide documents certifying completion of degree requirements and transcripts of results as soon as that part of the process is complete.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most universities have taken steps in recent years to provide all students with information about the expected time required between the submission of these theses and the various intermediate steps leading up to the presentation of a testamur.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department has been consistently pursuing the objectives outlined in this recommendation since the establishment of the Australia/Indonesia High Level Group (HLG) on Energy and Mineral Resources Consultations in 1989. The HLG has met five times since its establishment and fostered good relationships and rapport between the two countries. The information exchanged is of considerable interest to Australian resource industries in both the energy and mineral sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of Indonesia's increasing energy requirements, consultations will continue to focus on Indonesia's problems in resolving its energy demand and supply situation, with a view to identifying opportunities for energy sector cooperation and particularly the participation of Australian industries in the technology, services, equipment and investment fields.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the inaugural meeting of the Indonesia/Australian Ministerial Forum in 1992, Ministers on both sides agreed to establish Working Groups on power and gas cooperation and extended the mandate of the HLG to facilitate the establishment of these Working Groups. The objective of the Working Groups is to work closely with Indonesian officials and power and gas industries to identify and collaboratively develop, through to feasibility study stage, projects for the Indonesian power and gas sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Working Group on power cooperation now called the Indonesia/Australia Cooperation Forum on Electric Power, held its first meeting in Jakarta in early December 1993.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the REPP, a presentation was made which outlined a number of options through which this technology could be transferred to Indonesia including commercial agreements and bilateral or multilateral aid and investment mechanisms. It was agreed that these mechanisms might be further considered and progress could be monitored at future meetings of the HLG.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the process of developing the agenda for each of the HLG meetings with Indonesia, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy consults peak industry organisations and relevant Government Departments to ensure that the agenda developed takes into account prevailing issues and wherever possible, provides opportunities for industries to advise Indonesia of Australian expertise. Industry participation at meetings are fully encouraged where appropriate.</PARA>

The Working Group on Trade, Industry and Investment, at its second meeting in Darwin in October 1993, discussed issues relating to industry collaboration, the trade and investment regulatory environment, intellectual property, market access and services. These Working Groups are to produce substantive outcomes for consideration by the next Ministerial Forum meeting in the third quarter of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministerial Forum expanded the mandate of the High Level Group on Energy and Minerals and established separate Working Groups on power and gas cooperation. This should create a valuable mechanism for collaboration in Indonesia's power and gas sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the statements of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and of the government, but I have to say from the outset that his statement really did have all of the meekness that the minister has been accused of in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> editorial. For that reason it is a disappointing statement. I refer to that editorial because it is a most important newspaper with the largest circulation in the world. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS>, if nothing else, is a most influential paper on public thinking, if not government thinking. So when it accuses this minister and this country, by association, of being meek in the most important matter in our relationship with Indonesia&mdash;that is East Timor&mdash;then we should take the matter seriously. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS>, as reported, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The paper accused the Australian diplomats of employing Orwellian type newspeak when they avoid mentioning the words East Timor and referred to Timor, thus uniting in their vocabulary what Indonesia has vainly striven to unite with gun and bomb.</PARA>
<PARA>It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian diplomats meekly refuse to challenge Indonesia's illegal grab of Timor.</PARA>
<PARA>I highlight those matters. I am sure the minister is well aware of them as he did respond to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> editorial with his usual bluster. It is fair enough for him to do that on behalf of the government, but I would hope that in his political rhetoric and in his retort to that editorial he absorbed some of the significance of a newspaper of this standing taking such a position. The question of East Timor is becoming anaesthetised in Australia. It may be that it is not a matter on the minds of Australians generally or, for that matter, too great an issue in our immediate region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, on the whole, a very serious matter in world affairs&mdash;certainly within the European countries, the United States and the United Nations itself. So while we in this country may be slightly anaesthetised to the issue of East Timor, it is being noted and is still a fierce cause in other parts of the world, particularly in a leading country such as the United States. For that reason, I am disappointed with the government's response because it is meek. I have not had time to properly go through the government's response but I immediately wondered what would be the most significant step this government could take in its relations in Indonesia with regard to the East Timor situation? What would be the one big perception buster that would send the message out to take the human rights issue right up to the Indonesian government? I immediately went to recommendation No. 7 where the committee recommended that the Australian government should press for the reopening of its consulate in Dili. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that would be the most significant and cautious step. It would not be a slap in the face, as this minister is so rightly but concerningly attempting to avoid in his relations with Indonesia. If we were to re-establish our consulate in Dili, that would be that extra step towards pushing the human rights issues and the concerns we have in regard to East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in reading the government's response, as the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> rightly put it, it went into political speak and was very meek in responding to this recommendation. The government says that it is not a bad idea&mdash;indeed, it is not a bad idea&mdash;but weighs it up against the cost of setting up the consulate in Dili. There would be some cost to it, but I do not think it would outweigh the perception throughout the world if Australia were to take this step. It would not be a costly step as far as showing our bona fides towards human rights in this country is concerned. I do not think the Indonesians would see that as a huge slap in the face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that our embassy in Jakarta pays regular visits. As this response says, it visits there once a month. But if we are after a true and proper foreign affairs move in the area of East Timor to establish our human rights credentials throughout the world, the small cost towards setting up a consulate in Dili is the way to go. For that reason, without having read all the responses to the other recommendations, the government's response to the report falls down, and falls down significantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would classify the report itself as satisfactory, to the extent that it is highly descriptive of our nearest neighbours in Indonesia. It is probably very good for school projects. But it also falls down in a most significant area. The committee dedicates a chapter to human rights, and I must congratulate it on many of its recommendations in this area. It puts down some very significant points. On page 95, the committee recognises that the Indonesian incorporation of East Timor is the greatest difficulty in the relationship between that country and Australia. It properly recognises that, and I congratulate the committee for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also properly recognises such events as the Dili massacre, and recognises that the troops who fired on the protesters were unprovoked. That is a most significant recognition. It also recognises in its report that over 200,000 East Timorese have died since the invasion of 1975. While the committee has put pen to paper to certain significant points in its report, it could have done that back in Australia because a committee cannot write a proper and credible report on the East Timorese situation if it is not allowed to go to East Timor. That is where this report falls down: the committee was not allowed to visit East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to wonder about a government, the Indonesian government, that would not allow this high level Australian committee inquiring into Australia's relations with Indonesia to visit East Timor to study the human rights situation in that country. It is most regrettable that none of the members of that committee protested and that there was not a minority report in this particular area. One would have to think that when the committee went to Indonesia, under the authority's guidance, it saw what it was allowed to see. For that reason, it is highly disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The depth and sincerity of the Indonesians' glacial movement towards human rights&mdash;there have been some small steps taken, but surely not enough&mdash;will be monitored by the world. I come back to my point that while some Australians might think that this is a dead or at least comatose issue, throughout the world, particularly in the hallways of the UN, it is not a small issue. It will be monitored relentlessly. Every move the Indonesians make in regard to East Timor will be monitored relentlessly. This is not just another foreign affairs issue. This is a cause not only for the East Timorese but so many people in parliaments around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue that has not slipped away into history since the invasion in 1975. In fact, of late it has gained extra momentum, to the extent that there has been pressure put on the Indonesians to change their ways. As I said before, there have been some changes. But few are going to be blinded by those minuscule changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few are going to be blinded by the Indonesian government's underlying desire to anaesthetise this issue, because there have been certain key events, certain signposts, telling us that the Indonesian government, if left to its own devices, will not make genuine steps in the way of human rights. It would be no exaggeration for some to think that, if the Indonesian government did not have this world pressure bearing down upon it, there would be sanctioned genocide of the Timorese people. I cannot put it any stronger than that. Many already believe that the Indonesians would act in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will run through those key events. The first was the Dili massacre, as recent as 1991. Of course, in 1993 there was the lifetime gaoling of the freedom leader, Xanana. That trial was heavily criticised by none other than Amnesty International. In a paper that it has produced it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . like all political trials in East Timor and Indonesia, this one failed to meet international standards of fairness, or even to comply with Indonesia's own Code of Criminal Procedure.</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, of late there has been another key event, a most remarkable event which I think will come back to haunt the Indonesian government particularly in the run-up to the APEC conference, and that was the most remarkable intimidation of the Philippines by Indonesia. As most of the Senate would be aware, an Asia-Pacific conference on East Timor was due to be held in the Philippines. Due to the pressure of the Indonesian government upon another, two well-known leaders in world politics were banned from coming into the Philippines to attend that conference. They were none other than the French President's wife, Madame Mitterand, and a nobel prize winner. That would have to create serious concerns for the United Nations about the Indonesians being at all serious. One would have to wonder what sort of intimidation the Indonesians place on our own foreign affairs minister if that is what they can do to the Philippines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Evans's statement, I say that there is still an enormous way to go before human rights look like being re-established in East Timor. But over and above that we have to believe that Indonesia will not advance in the area of human rights in East Timor unless strong pressure is maintained upon that government. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">New York Times</EMPHASIS> has reported, Australia has been very meek and mild in its approach in the area of human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government response is extremely disappointing, if predictable. I must put on record that, having put in a dissent to the committee's recommendations, I found them to be extremely disappointing. The first recommendation that the committee made and that the government is accepting is that Australia should not enter into any provisions which establish extraterritorial liability for products manufactured in Australia. I said at the time, and I repeat, that that is the wrong way to go to assist Australian industries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, as we develop our products to a high level of quality and high level of customised innovative design, we will be in a position to capture increasingly markets overseas. What a boon it would be if we could say to buyers overseas that manufacturers of products made in Australia will stand by their quality standards and, if those products do not perform, those buyers are protected. I believe that not to do so is extremely short-sighted. Even at this late stage, I call on the government to reconsider its position because, clearly, the government is anticipating making some amendments to the relevant legislation regarding some of the other items and it is not too late to have another look at this particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the second recommendation the government agrees&mdash;it has not entirely accepted this; it has taken note of it&mdash;that possibly some changes need to be made. The committee recommended that the period of repose for actions taken under the Trade Practices Act 1974 should remain at 10 years, with one exception: a court should be able to extend the period of repose if it is shown that on or before the date the product was supplied the manufacturer knew, or ought to have known, that the product was defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government rejects the case that was made for extending the statute of repose to 20 years&mdash;on the principle that our products must be able to stand up to the quality standards that are expected if they are put to proper use. That suggestion was based on the knowledge that there are classes of products where the damage or the fault in them is not known for a long time. The government, in its response, acknowledges that this is particularly the case in products which can produce toxic harm and defines toxic harm as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . harm which is functional impairment, illness or death resulting from exposure to an object, substance, emission, mixture, raw material or physical agent of particular composition.</PARA>
<PARA>The government suggests that that should be taken into account and, where such products are concerned, the period of liability should be extended. The government then offers two alternatives. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alternatively, the exception to the 10 year period could be based on the Australian Law Reform Commission's formulation to cover cases where "the loss or damage caused by the way the goods acted was not, and could not reasonably have been discovered within that period" . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The third option to be considered is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the formulation in the US Model Uniform Product Liability Act which excludes cases where "the harm caused within the 10 year period did not manifest itself until after that time."</PARA>
<PARA>The point to be made is that the government could adopt all three options. There is no need to be exclusive in this. All three exceptions have merit. I call on the government, when it considers the amendments that arise from these considerations, to incorporate all three options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final recommendation to be considered is the burden of proof. It was suggested that in our legal system in the area of product liability the consumer is always at the weaker end of the balance. The consumer cannot get all the information from the manufacturer. The manufacturer need not disclose all the process of manufacturing&mdash;only whether the faults had been caused by the manufacture or the materials that were used. The government says that it cannot accept that reversal of onus of proof because there was no consensus. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The absence of any consensus among the proponents of change as to how or to what extent the plaintiff should be assisted was an important factor in this decision.</PARA>
<PARA>I really find that difficult to understand because, during the hearings of the committee, a number of organisations and people who gave evidence simply agreed without qualification that the onus of proof should be reversed: the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs, the Australian Law Reform Commission, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the Australian Consumers Association and Professor Goldring. If that is not a consensus of those organisations and people that have the consumers' interest at heart, I do not know what is. I think it is quite clear on this occasion that the government has once again buckled under the onslaught from manufacturers who claim that, if the quality standards that they are expected to adhere to are subjected to too much pressure, their markets will shrink and their profits will drop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the point I made when we discussed extraterritoriality: very clearly, our manufacturers would do much better to place emphasis on quality, reliability and good design. They would then have nothing to fear. The government should remodel its industry policy to provide assistance to industry in terms of additional research and easy finance for venture capital to develop new products, and to assist Australian industries to market their products properly. I believe that is a positive, constructive way to go rather than maintaining protection for shoddy materials and shoddy products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the government's response to this report is a disappointing one. I can but hope that, in relation to the obvious positive policy which calls for `new growth'&mdash;as the theory is called; it was developed in Chicago University&mdash;and which offers hope for our industries, a more positive attitude to product liability legislation is combined with such a drive and that this ultimately will be the industry policy that we will be pursuing in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt matters of truth do not interest Senator Bolkus, but matters of truth should be paramount in this chamber. If he wants to make any more inane interjections perhaps you, Mr Acting Deputy President, could encourage him not to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts in this matter are not really open to an immense amount of dispute. My notice of motion on 3 May, to which this report refers, noted Councillor Samaras's involvement in a fraud perpetrated by Mr Gino Mandarino, who was fined $800 for forging an electoral form. Mr Mandarino is a member of the electorate staff of the Labor member for Throsby, Mr Colin Hollis. Maybe factional loyalty is encouraging Senator Bolkus to be excited about this. Mr Mandarino admitted involvement in forging an election document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Federal Police counsel, Mr Ian Bourke, said Mandarino's action was deliberate conceit and accused him of showing reckless disregard and contempt for the electoral system. Magistrate Derrick Price said that while he accepted that Mandarino may have been acting out of misguided political fervour during a hotly contested election&mdash;I might say that it was an election to gain control of the New South Wales Young Labor Organisation, and Mandarino was acting on behalf of the left wing&mdash;it was important that people acted honestly in regard to the Electoral Act. The official charge against Mandarino was that he uttered, knowing it to be forged, a document deliverable to the Australian Electoral Commission&mdash;an electoral enrolment form in the name of Arne Cambourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note Councillor Samaras's involvement in this matter as set out in court by the Australian Federal Police and not subsequently denied: Councillor Samaras, while a staff member of former Cunningham member of parliament Stewart West, called at the Commonwealth Electoral Commission's Wollongong office to inquire whether an enrolment form in the name of Arne Cambourne had been lodged. Councillor Samaras was advised that no form had been received. Later that morning the form was found in the mail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, Mr Mandarino, who had been advised of this information that Councillor Samaras had received, filed a forged enrolment form, a copy of which was faxed from Mr West's office, with Councillor Samaras's specific approval, to Sydney. In other words, there is no dispute that there was a clear involvement by Councillor Samaras in these actions which led to the successful prosecution of Mr Mandarino. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What intrigues me is that Councillor Samaras has totally denied it and says it is totally untrue. In his response, however, he failed to deal with these details of his clear involvement in this matter. He does not even try to excuse this involvement as innocent, which surely he should have done had this involvement been innocent. Instead, he has denied any involvement whatsoever, which is patently and self-evidently false. He does so by a carefully worded piece of nonsense. The report of the privileges committee reports that he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Baume alleges that I have been involved in electoral fraud. This is untrue.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that he did have an involvement. I said that he had an involvement, but he said that was untrue. He then goes on, in some kind of defence of his position, to make a whole series of denials of allegations that I did not make. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have never breached any provision of any electoral act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that was not the allegation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">nor have I ever asked any other person to breach any electoral law.</PARA>
<PARA>That was not the allegation. But he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allegation is simply false. I have never been before a court. I have never been charged with an offence. I have never been arrested. The allegation has no basis.</PARA>
<PARA>He denies a whole lot of allegations that were not made. But it does raise some interesting questions. What he has now said raises the question of whether he knew what Mr Mandarino was up to. That now becomes a serious question. Councillor Samaras denies everything else, but he does not deal with the question of whether he knew that the information he got was to be misused by Mr Mandarino in an electoral fraud. If Councillor Samaras wants to make proper public statements about this, perhaps he should tell us whether he had any suspicion that Mr Mandarino was up to something. I think it is important to find out whether Mr Samaras was either a willing or an unwitting accessory. He may well have been totally innocent, but the fact is that he does not say so. He just denies that he had any involvement whatsoever, and we know that to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem this raises is that, if people use this particular privilege which is quite properly given to aggrieved citizens to clear their names in this parliament, then I think there is a responsibility on these people to tell the truth. It seems to me that, in a sense, the parliamentarian who finds himself on the receiving end of an allegation that he has told lies&mdash;and Samaras's allegation is basically that I have said things that are untrue&mdash;gets ambushed at the time. He has no knowledge that he is going to be accused of saying things that are untrue. All he knows is that the privileges committee is going to recommend that a response be printed. Then, in this case a couple of days later, the parliamentarian gets the opportunity to demonstrate that the report contains total falsehoods, that the aggrieved citizen has lied, that the aggrieved citizen has not addressed himself for the alleged cause of the complaint in a proper, coherent and rational way and that the aggrieved citizen has responded to a whole series of allegations which were not made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Councillor Samaras is obviously very keen to clear the air on this matter. After all, he is seeking to be a candidate for the Labor Party for preselection to the New South Wales upper house. That might explain his enthusiasm to have this statement incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Maybe he will be a bit more enthusiastic to tell the truth next time and to recognise that he had an involvement and to recognise that it is up to him now to assert that that involvement was totally innocent, if it was innocent. It does not mean that, if he were involved to the extent of the illegal activity, he would have been charged. The Federal Police have acknowledged that there was an accessory who has not been charged, but there is no suggestion that that was Councillor Samaras. Other people were involved in this fraud. I think we have to recognise that these procedures should be properly used, not improperly used as has happened in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report. I have been trying to do this for some weeks but, because of the way the program has been operating, that has not been possible. I have taken a great interest in this particular report and I believe that it is useful for the Senate to receive some update on progress of some of the recommendations in the report. I believe that it is useful for us to do this with reports because they are not simply passed through the Senate in order to be put on a shelf where nobody reads them or takes any notice of the recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this was a very timely report and one that raised very serious and historical issues within Australian industrial relationships, and particularly within the development of the shearing industry. Many Australian shearers were not happy with this report and a number of those have contacted my office since the report was brought down. It is important to know that they still have some concerns. By taking note of the recommendations of the committee those concerns can be taken on board and we can ensure that the wool industry goes ahead and is not subject to the kinds of disputes that we have seen over many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this disillusionment, anger or perhaps frustration of some of the shearers has been noted in the media. I noted that an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 24 February&mdash;that is how long I have been waiting to speak on this report&mdash;stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A UNION branch has threatened to oppose the pre-selection of Labor senators after a Senate inquiry's rejection of union allegations that New Zealand shearers were taking Australian shearers' jobs and dodging tax.</PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting that the level of frustration is such that they have raised that possibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the report was brought down, I spoke to it. I pointed out that, even though we were convinced as a committee that the level of intervention by New Zealand shearers in our shearing industry was really only about six per cent of the total number of shearers in Australia, nevertheless, of course, even that six per cent is significant in terms of the downturn and the crisis in the wool industry which we have had over the past few years and which, thankfully, is now beginning to mitigate. Far more significant factors in the downturn in the shearing industry of which we were aware were growers shearing their own sheep; fewer sheep being sheared; and the incomes of woolgrowers, of course, being slashed by the downturn in prices. But, even so, the six per cent loss of jobs to New Zealand shearers is significant if you are one of the people who have been replaced by that six per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, another article was brought to my attention by shearers. It was in a magazine which is published in New Zealand, simply called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Shearing</EMPHASIS>. The subtitle is `A magazine for all in the shearing world'. That article drew my attention to the fact that New Zealand shearers very aggressively market their talents in the UK. A couple of paragraphs from this magazine state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations with the UK Employment Dept on entry of shearers over 27 years old has produced a system which worked smoothly in a trial last season, writes Tony Cave-Penney from the National Association of Agricultural Contractors. Still, it means planning and paperwork for both contractor and shearer. Tony explains:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you are over 27 we advise you not to try the old "holiday routine" method of entry. Unfortunately, last year, a number were turned back at UK airports because the immigration authorities considered they were coming here to work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is thought that about half the national flock is shorn by itinerant shearers.</PARA>
<PARA>This is in the UK. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No-one knows the number that come into Britain each year. With the increase in unemployment in the UK and EC, the authorities are trying to fill jobs within the Community in the first instance. Hence the increased vigilance at ports of entry.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the article concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UK sheep industry has to show that it is training people to become shearers. There are already training schemes but very few trained people are enticed to become professional shearers. New welfare codes demand that all wool breeds of sheep are shorn at least once a year so Britain will still need qualified NZ shearers for many years.</PARA>
<PARA>I read those extracts from the magazine article to show that Australian shearers are very alert. They still feel that, if New Zealand shearers market their talents so aggressively in Great Britain, perhaps the committee in its report could have given a little more weight to the marketing of the New Zealand shearers' talents in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I fully support the report of committee. I am just raising the issue that out there in the shearing industry there is still some sense of frustration. I believe that there is a need to listen to that frustration and to try to come to some resolution. I would underline the fact that the committee recommended the establishment of forums for consultation between the Australian Workers Union, the Shearing Contractors Association of Australia, the National Farmers Federation and other farming organisations. That was a very creative suggestion which I believe has been taken up. I really hope that the Senate will in due course learn of the progress of those talks and learn also that the conflict and frustration, which still exist, have been dealt with. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason for the inquiry being conducted was the way in which certain AWU members lobbied the government and whoever else might listen about all the work being taken from them by New Zealand shearers. Also, there were quite a few public accusations or statements as to tax evasion and award breaches that were occurring and which were reducing the quality of life and living standards of Australian shearers, with the blame being laid at the feet of the New Zealand shearers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it quite clear that history shows that for at least 100 years or more there has been a situation of confrontation between the graziers and the shearers who were members of the AWU. Certainly, it was somewhat patchy; in some areas there was a lot more cooperation than in others, but there has been that confrontation situation. In 1992 people went on strike because, if they were members of a union, the pastoralists would not give them a job. Then we had a long period in which the AWU very successfully used the arbitration commission, both nationally and in the states, to establish and upgrade awards, based on different types of arguments. I refer, for instance, to similar wage justification, when wage increases were made in other areas of work; there were questions of certain disabilities; and the fact that, because times were changing, better accommodation should be provided. Then we went through another period when accommodation was not so important for shearers; they were going out in cars and returning home to the country areas. So all of these changes took place, with quite a lot of undercurrents of confrontation and disagreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, of course, the AWU had organisers who were able to move around fairly quickly in motor cars, but who had to cover very large areas. Of course, we were not in a position to ensure that they had the good union organisation that they had previously. Members of the AWU came to rely on the organiser rather than on themselves to see that awards were kept. In the process, there was a reasonable development of industrial relations between the shearers themselves and the people for whom they worked, the graziers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could be led to the conclusion, from recent press statements and statements by some people in the AWU, that New Zealand shearers have only been in Australia for a few years. Indeed, New Zealand shearers have been shearing in Australia for 30 or 40 years. During those times, of course, having regard to flock numbers and the fact that there were vacancies available, those New Zealand shearers were in small numbers and fitted in quite well with the members of the AWU and the Australian shearers. They observed awards and became involved in activity to ensure that awards were kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In more recent years New Zealand shearers have been here in larger numbers. It does appear that there is some sort of division between Australian and New Zealand shearers. That division was not helped by some of the friction caused by individuals. Rather than becoming part of the great group of Australian shearers and fitting in, they did seem to isolate themselves. We embarked on this inquiry on the basis that we wanted to get to the facts. We wanted to look at evidence, not hearsay. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not need encouragement, thank you. So we decided we would look at the facts; I believe that is the way in which every inquiry should proceed. We were able to talk to people from the Taxation Office; we were able to talk to people from industrial relations; we were able to talk to graziers; and to people from the AWU. Of course, one thing became clear: there was no more tax evasion by New Zealand shearers than by Australian shearers. That position is clearly stated in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We looked at the question of award breaches. The AWU over time had not been able to prove too many of those. But I make my attitude clear on this: award breaches occur in every industry, in some cases in quite substantial numbers. They are there because of collusion between the people who work and the people for whom they work. People in the industrial relations scene, organisers, and people who are inspectors, who are given the task of making sure the awards are operating correctly, are not in a position to pinpoint those areas. Collusion defeats that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, while I say that the facts as given to us and the evidence supplied by people from all sides did not show many breaches at all, it would be quite wrong for anyone to believe that the breaches were not there in substantial numbers over time. I make the point, too, that sometimes what can be a technical breach of the award can also be a situation where both parties agree to be a bit flexible on a particular award provision that is mutually beneficial to them. While it may be an award breach, it may be suitable to both sides. We found that very few straight out award breaches in contravention of the wishes of the workers could be shown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we came to the conclusion that taxation was not being avoided. In fact, many New Zealand shearers were paying higher tax at a given time than Australians. The award breaches were very few. The AWU needs to look at the award, to upgrade it, and to have talks with the graziers towards this end. In the report we recommended, as Senator Woodley has said, that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) should become involved to try to bring the parties together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly supported such a view and put it forward. Different industry awards and agreements are being looked at and upgraded all over Australia in particular enterprises. In many cases, the agreements can take the place of an award and can be a little better. In other places the agreement may be in regard to a few provisions but having the safety net of the award. All of these things are happening. Different attitudes are being taken to flexibility in working hours, shift work and all these other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we said to people in the shearing industry, for instance, that maybe one day the shearing industry would work on the basis of shift work, they would respond in a horrified fashion. Many people in other industries who once never worked shift work are now working shift work as an accepted way of work. When discussion takes place between the graziers' organisation and the AWU many things should be on the table. I would like to see an award come into operation as a result of such discussions that is really workable, one that both sides feel should be observed. In that event we would not have the problems of the sorts of confrontations that we have now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the inquiry was not able to prove some of the things that were said by way of criticism, it was very worthwhile to the extent that it laid the basis for future discussions. The end result will be what most people in industrial relations search for&mdash;a reasonable profit for the enterprises and workers being able to share in that profit and wealth that is created. Neither side will be entirely happy because there is always an argument about the cut up, and each side considers it is being exploited by the other. I think it is a good report and I recommend it to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just listen. He has not done a 180-degree turn since he has been here, but he has a vastly different approach to this issue now from what he had before the inquiry. I commend him on his new approach. I was very surprised at some of the comments Senator Woodley made. I did not hear all his speech, but some of what I heard was pre-inquiry sort of thinking. I believe that the inquiry was a very worthwhile exercise. I have been kept well-informed by Senator Crane, who was a shearer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that Senator Burns admits that tax evasion amongst shearers does not exist to the extent that a lot of people thought it did. However, I want to take up the point he raised about breaches of the award. Senator Burns said that the inquiry found no evidence of breaches of the award but that he believed such breaches exist. I could not see why he would say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some experience of shearing, although not as much as Senator Crane. I did do some shearing and I have a lot of experience paying shearing teams at the end of shearing. We have a New Zealand contractor who employs New Zealanders and Australians or whoever suits him best. I have never been offered, nor have I asked for, a contract that cuts the award rate. Senator Woodley spoke about the aggressive marketing of shearing. If that existed I would have expected the shearer to have come in with a much lower price but that has never happened. </PARA>

Senator Burns has always claimed that there have been breaches of the award&mdash;I will come to technical breaches of the award later. From practical experience, I know that New Zealanders do not cut the award rate, but they are prepared to shear for the award rate. The Australian shearer has been more prone to demand above-award payment. It is fair enough for that shearer to try to do that at the height of the season. In Western Australia, the height of the season is from the third week in July to roughly the middle of October. If those shearers can get that rate, good luck to them. The point is that the New Zealand shearers are always prepared to shear for the award rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns referred to technical breaches of the award. I presume that a technical breach would mean shearing on a Saturday morning for a run or two to finish up. Look at it this way: our shearing team is at least 500 kilometres from home. If on a Friday afternoon of the last week of shearing there is one run left&mdash;two hours shearing&mdash;would it not be sensible to finish that two hours shearing on a Saturday morning? It might be a bit much to expect them to box for two hours on a Friday night, but would it not be sensible to finish that two hours shearing on the Saturday so that the shearers could spend the rest of the weekend with their families, maybe having the Monday off to make up for the extra bit they did on the Saturday morning? Would it not be more sensible to do that and maybe start on the Tuesday morning?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does Senator Burns believe that there should be no technical breach of the award?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about them being more important but there are a number of comments that I would like to make about this inquiry by the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs and its report on New Zealand shearers. I would like to start by acknowledging the contributions of the committee members. I particularly include our chairman. This was a much more difficult inquiry for the Australian Labor Party members than it was for the coalition members. I say that because, firstly, the coalition members have had more practical experience in the shearing shed over their lifetimes; secondly, the inquiry started on a spurious basis of the claim that 42 per cent of Australian sheep were shorn by New Zealanders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all knew that was not correct but nonetheless the inquiry did perform a very useful function. The recommendations that have come out of it, particularly in relation to training and further award restructuring, are important. The shearing industry did participate in the award restructuring two or three years ago and some significant changes were made to the award. I see that Senator Forshaw has come in. He was a principal player, I believe, in that award restructuring. A lot of flexibility was introduced into the award that did not exist before, which picked up in a lot of instances what was happening on the ground. We need to recognise that, but as Senator Burns said, it needs to go a little further. I will not go over time tonight because I have to catch a VIP plane back to Western Australia&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important that Senator Crowley is here with us because there is no doubt from the evidence that over the last eight to 10 years the involvement of women in the shearing shed has been an important development. I knew this as a person involved in the industry. I should declare an interest because I am a woolgrower and I did shear for 20 years, so I had a little practice at the game. The involvement of women in the shearing shed and their handling of wool have been incredibly beneficial to the industry. For whatever reason&mdash;and I am not going to go into that&mdash;it is my view from my experience and from the evidence that was given to us that by and large women are better wool handlers than men. Whether it is because they have more patience or whatever is irrelevant; it is an important development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The breaches of the award are minimal, very much at the edges. We did not come up with any substantial breaches, certainly not in terms of pay. Generally, awards were observed. The other point that needs mentioning in terms of this report is the number of New Zealanders operating in Australia. The interesting point about the number of New Zealanders here is that the vast majority of them are residents of Australia; they live here. One particular individual who gave evidence and pointed out the facts as he knew them said that his understanding was that most of the people in this area had been in Australia&mdash;working, paying taxes, their children going to school, or whatever part of community life they were involved in&mdash;for more than 10 years. It was interesting to learn how stories grow on top of stories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In one particular instance in Queensland&mdash;I forget the name of the town&mdash;after some encouragement, an individual appeared before the committee. I am sure Senator Burns will remember this well. The individual had been named as one of the big, bad New Zealanders. He got up and said, `I want to put a couple of things on the record. One, I have been in Australia for 18 years. I married an Australian girl. I have four Australian children but actually I am a citizen of New Guinea.'  That gives us some idea of how myths grow up. Getting these things on the public record is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that needs to be understood very clearly is that most of the problems in the shearing industry, and in this particular blow-up, emanate from the collapse of the wool market and the enormous drop in sheep numbers. Pressure was put on employment because within a very short time&mdash;some four to five years&mdash;sheep numbers dropped from 173 million to 139 million. I am using figures estimated over the past two years. It meant that almost a quarter of the sheep were slaughtered or were sent to market and that there were fewer sheep to be shorn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This created the problem that there were the same number of shearers to shear approximately 25 per cent fewer sheep. This must be taken into consideration when we deal with this subject. A great deal of emotion was generated on both sides of the equation. On one side were the woolgrowers and farmers who were being economically pushed and losing a lot of money on their operations, and on the other side were the people involved on the production line&mdash;the shearers, rouseabouts and wool classers&mdash;who were also being economically pushed because there were not the same number of sheep to shear. When the government develops policy responses, it is important that it understands that there is economic pressure on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have worked with shearers, I have employed shearers and wool classers, and I have worked on a lot of properties. I can say quite categorically that in my experience 99 per cent of the employers that I worked with were very good, considerate and helpful. I can say the same about the shearers that I worked with on the board, the rouseabouts, the wool classers and the wool pressers. But it is the one per cent of people&mdash;and this runs right across the shearing industry&mdash;who often give the industry a bad name, and certainly an unfair name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the government in its response to this report, and in response to any matter pertaining to the wool industry, not to direct all the efforts to the side of the one per cent of the industry who cause a lot of heartburn, heartache and disputation. They are the people, whether employers or employees, that we do not need in the industry. If we continue to see the current improvement in wool prices, I think the problem will go away very quickly. Australian sheep numbers will build up to 150 million or 160 million again, there will be sufficient work to go around and there will be a return to the producers. As a result I believe content will return to the industry. </PARA>

I know that before the tax file number was introduced shearers could go and work for an employer, and because of the itinerant nature of the work be taxed at a much lower rate because they were not in employment for a long period. That also was due to the seasonal nature of shearing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, we are not going to get people to come forward to give evidence to a committee seeking to identify that sort of problem because such witnesses could implicate themselves. Nor are graziers willing to come forward. I think the government's effort to ensure that the NFF enters into discussions with the AWU with regard to award matters is a worthwhile step. Whether or not it will work will remain to be seen. I think the government must continue to monitor the situation. If we are looking at protecting the employment of Australians in general, then monitoring is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Panizza and Senator Crane might be interested to know that on four or five occasions in the past 10 years the NFF has sought to deny shearers national wage increases. The federation has an application before the IRC to reduce shearing rates and to take away the 2 1/2 per cent national wage increase. I fear that the cooperation between the NFF and the shearers and unions will not necessarily do anything to solve this problem. It is no good saying one thing and meaning another. It is unfortunate that the committee could not get the evidence to support the claims made. I know from personal experience that the problem exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the government will continue to monitor the situation so that the problem does not get worse. One of the problems is that there is no recognition of shearing as a trade. People do not get a certificate or accredited when they become shearers even though it is a very skilful line of work. Whether or not the shearer performs correctly can determine the worth of a woolgrower's clip. As a result of this report, I hope that the government will continues to monitor progress in the industry and keep an eye on what is happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of six bills is the second group of bills dealing with agricultural and veterinary chemicals to pass through the chamber this year. It makes a total of some 14 bills. It is rather ironic that after so many years of no progress at all on this issue we see such a flurry of legislative activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous package provided a scheme for the evaluation, registration and control of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in the ACT, and it was envisaged that complementary legislation would be passed throughout Australia so that the approval, registration, control and supply of those chemicals would come under the auspices of the National Registration Authority. I referred to it at the time as the `one-stop shop' approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation and, indeed, the entire concept behind registration came out of a Senate committee, for which I was the deputy chair under Senator Colston some years ago. One should never be surprised at the speed or lack of it that it takes to enact legislation, and the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation is no exception. It should therefore come as no surprise to the Senate that the legislation before us now is a consequence of most of the state governments not enacting legislation in time for commencement of the national agricultural and veterinary registration scheme on 1 July. In fact, I regret to say that, of all the states, only South Australia has put the necessary legislation in place. Other states will be some months in getting it through, and one or two may not even have it ready before the beginning of 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original legislation set up a three-tier method of payment for cost recovery by industry of operation of the registration scheme. Next financial year it is to be 83 per cent cost recovery, and it will be 100 per cent the following year. Without state complementary legislation the re-registration fee cannot be collected. There lies a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation proposes to shift the money that the Commonwealth would have collected in the re-registration fee onto a product levy. There is a sunset clause to this legislation so the charging can revert to the original intent of the first package of bills once complementary legislation is passed through the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However&mdash;here is the problem&mdash;there is the potential for the states to use this legislation as a windfall chance for an additional tax. There is a commitment from the Victorian, New South Wales and Queensland state governments that they will waive the charges. A similar commitment, however, has not yet been forthcoming from Western Australia, Tasmania or the ACT. But I am confident that my colleagues in those states will waste no opportunity in suggesting to those governments that they do not levy the charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, if the charges are levied on the chemical companies the cost will merely be passed down the line to the end user, which in most cases is the farmer. For that reason, I would caution, as indeed my colleague the shadow minister for primary industries did in the other place, the National Registration Authority to ensure that it remains efficient and cost effective. It is absolutely essential that it does that. Farmers are fed up with being made to pay for inefficient services over which they have little or no control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind the Senate of the appalling mess AQIS has got itself into in recent years&mdash;total mismanagement of its funds and the work ethic that has developed within some levels of the organisation that suggests it does not matter if someone else is footing the bill. In fact, the other day at the Blayney abattoirs the inspectors just decided that they were going to go out. Six hundred people were put off for the day because there was no job for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Registration Authority may well be a 100 per cent cost recovery operation and not a direct financial burden on government, but taxpayers still foot the bill.

That has sometimes happened and I think it happens occasionally with AQIS, especially in the meat inspection area at different times. The coalition will be watching this authority with the same keenness with which it has monitored AQIS over the years and expects it to perform in a way in which the user does get full benefit and the users paying will feel as though they are getting full benefit out of the user pays system. </PARA>

The other states must be kept aware, though, of their slowness in moving towards the national ag and vet registration scheme and the problems this could cause. Re-registration comes in on 1 July and if the states try to double dip, if you like, I think it is up to us to make sure that it does not happen. It is also up to us to really take them to task if they do something that is in the wrong manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this package of agricultural and veterinary chemical bills. These bills are significant. The matters that they address have been of continuing significance to the people in Australia. We have before us a series of bills which will give effect to interim cost recovery arrangements for the operation of the National Registration Authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope senators recall that just a few weeks ago the Australian Democrats opposed legislation establishing the National Registration Authority. We opposed the bill for a number of critical reasons. It was our view that the NRA is not properly based on sound principles of ecologically sustainable development and that the NRA was not going to provide enough information to enable interested people to adequately participate in the process of the registration of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were tempted to say at the time that the legislation then was a con. Support for the assessment that we made came a short while later, when this Senate extended the life of interim arrangements because the states had not passed complementary legislation. That was after the Senate and the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs had been stampeded&mdash;I use that word advisedly&mdash;into rejecting the Democrats' amendments and community concerns. They were stampeded into that because it was thought necessary that that particular set of bills be passed by 30 June so that all the start-up dates could be met and the deal that was supposed to be stitched up with the states could come into play. But it had not been, so we extended the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the NRA has commenced operating there is further evidence that the elaborate legislative references to public consultation and sustainability in particular are in fact nothing more than smokescreens, that there is absolutely no intention to properly involve the public or to limit chemical use. What is more, there is what amounts to denigration of people who are daily suffering the effects of ever increasing quantities and varieties of deadly chemicals in our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Senate passed this legislation the NRA has provided public release summaries for metosulum and clorsulon, in our view with undue haste and contradictory to the principle that for sustainability we need fewer chemicals rather than more. In this context, I wish to object to the presentation from the chairman of the NRA charting the process and influences surrounding the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. When I say `charting', I mean presentation in diagrammatic form of what the process is. Without trying too much to use words to draw a picture, anybody who has seen the chart which has been prepared of this process would know that it is an octagon with ever decreasing zones and bits and pieces supposedly interacting with each other. The chart shows the NRA's task has been to rubber-stamp proposals to register chemicals from the chemical industry because it does not show any other refinements. It does not show the NRA having input from other areas. It simply shows a rubber-stamping process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Registration is depicted as the target, the goal, to be achieved after overcoming community concerns which are interpreted and even written down as being `chemophobic'. This term is particularly offensive and has angered hundreds of people who daily battle against the as yet unrecognised adverse effects of chemicals in their environment and in ours. To describe them in such a way I think illustrates an attitude which should not reflect the attitude of the National Registration Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation that I am referring to, proudly called `The Octagon' and designed by the NRA chairman, is an unfortunate and out of place creation which has done nothing to rebuild community confidence in the NRA and in the use and legitimisation of chemicals. I take this opportunity to call on the NRA to withdraw that creation and to apologise to the community of chemical victims throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I view with concern the total absence of proper analytical standards. What we have here are summaries of data reviewed and an invitation to the public to comment before deciding whether to proceed to approve the chemical. The summaries are nothing more than a huge and expensive farce. They may well be summaries but, as far as providing a basis from which the public can offer any sensible comment, they are demonstrably useless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When somebody presents a report of an experiment, or writes a thesis, one is normally obliged to provide either the evidence of the processes used and the results obtained or extensive referencing to proper documentation. That is normal academic process. As we understand it in Australia, that is the proper way to present information. One does not write any sort of academic analysis without citing the references, without referring to sources and without supporting opinion or experimentation. This is an example of something without any of those supporting documentations. The idea that the NRA is being in any way helpful or open by providing totally unsubstantiated assertion is absurd and an insult to anybody who wants to find further information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation gets worse. I understand that some comments on the summaries have referred to the lack of citations to which the NRA has responded. I quote from the NRA in response to people's concerns about the lack of rigour:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several respondents mentioned the lack of references cited in the public release summary. It therefore needs to be made clear in future PRSs that the information provided in them is a very brief version, presenting only the conclusions reached by the various expert reviewers . . . Any trial data presented for evaluation has to be of a standard publishable in a reputable reference journal. It is clearly impossible in a summary to present all the data considered . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This nonsense compounds the problem and suggests a fraud. There is no other word to use. What is the point of inviting comment without providing either source documentation or the results on which the conclusions are based? The results might just as well be figments of someone else's imagination. For all we know, they might be. There is no way of telling. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators would no doubt be aware that this parliament has been involved in a long and protracted debate on the subject of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This started with a Senate standing committee report back in 1992 and was followed by seven bills which were introduced in December 1993 and subsequently reported on by the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, of which I am a member. I am pleased to see that the chairman of that committee is with us tonight and Senator Brownhill, who is also a member of that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is  fair to say that the parliament has given a thorough examination of this very important subject. I was very satisfied with the results which came from the hearings of the rural and regional affairs committee. I believe that report went a long way towards addressing the issues of the rural community and also concerned members of the public&mdash;and I would have thought Senator Bell as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That package of bills ensured that there would be important safeguards, such as public access to information, the recognition of community service obligations, third party appeals and the control of use after sale. Importantly, the bill was to establish a national approach for the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The original package of bills was supported by the agricultural and veterinary chemicals industry, the NFF and Commonwealth agencies involved in agriculture. We thought that the agricultural and veterinary chemicals code which was set out in the schedule to the legislation would be adopted by the enactment of complementary legislation in each state and the Northern Territory. That would have ensured that the evaluation, approval, registration and supply of agricultural and veterinary chemicals would be administered uniformly across Australia by the National Registration Authority. The authority had played a key part in implementing the findings of our rural and regional affairs committee on the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has insisted on recovering 83 per cent of the cost of the registrations in the next financial year and 100 per cent the year after. The original legislation set up a three-year method of payment. This included an application fee, which was to be paid when applying to have a new chemical registered, a registration fee and a levy on products sold. The fact is that without complementary legislation the re-registration fee cannot be collected and it is therefore necessary to use a levy as an alternative revenue raiser. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it is fair to say that the states have been dragging their heels in terms of passing complementary legislation. I believe that this is extremely regrettable, as we should have had in place by now a uniform set of national procedures. That was the understanding of our committee. I understand that this is not as a result of changes in policy at the ministerial level and that there is still broad agreement on the need for a uniform scheme to evaluate the register and control the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That said, there can hardly be too many legitimate reasons why the states are able to claim support for the legislation but not back up those claims in a more practical and convincing manner. As a result, we have been left with no option but to provide for interim cost recovery arrangements to allow for the operation of the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>

Therefore, any additional charges could have an adverse effect upon the recovery process which is starting to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke earlier of the National Registration Authority. I alluded to the important part played by the chairman of the NRA, Professor Ben Selinger, when the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs was considering the original package of legislation. I again stress that I believe the NRA has a very important role to play in terms of the control of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in this country. I am very much aware that, as spelt out by Professor Selinger, the NRA will be starting somewhat behind the eight ball because of the poor public perception which exists regarding the use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I might cite my own experience. As Senator Brownhill knows, in my earlier life I was an orchardist. In those days, orchardists were very much involved in the use of chemicals but had very little education in their use. Most of the sprays we used in those days for orchards were of pretty basic origin. If I remember correctly, the basic sprays we used were lime sulphur, a mixture of lime and sulphur&mdash;which was foul smelling and rather sharp on the eyes&mdash;bluestone and oil. With technology we got into DDT. I have sprayed a fair bit of DDT and I am still standing up, but I am sure I have got plenty in my bones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later on the organophosphates came into vogue.

I have always been rather sceptical about the long-term effects of some of those early organophosphates. I remember very well one day when we were thinning apples after having sprayed them with a chemical called Rogor. In those days, I have to admit that I used to roll my own cigarettes&mdash;as we all did. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was tobacco. We all felt rather dizzy, and it was not the cigarettes; we put it down to the fact that we had been handling apples with spray on them. I suppose that same effect was felt by many others. The concern in this area lies not only with sprays that were used in the fruit industry. Those of us who have used pour-on lice control would know that, in a confined area, the fumes are rather nasty. Sheep dip is likely to make people feel a bit ill if they are not using it in the correct way. In the past there was a terrible lack of education about all sorts of agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition and the industry support the measures introduced by the government in this package of bills. Even though Senator Bell has been rather critical of some parts of this legislation, it all gets back to the NRA. I have the greatest faith in Professor Selinger. The committee will be very interested to assess the work of the NRA. Although the NRA's role is very important, we must remember that when these products come at a cost to the user which, by and large, is the rural sector, the NRA will have to prove to its stakeholders that it is doing the job on their behalf. If this proves to be the case, I am sure it will enjoy the continued support of the coalition and all those members of the rural and regional affairs committee who spent so much time assessing the evidence put before us at committee hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By happy coincidence, the topic of my adjournment speech is also in relation to chemicals in terms of organochlorine insecticides. I would like to briefly comment on Western Australia's cessation of organochlorine imports, which is a matter welcomed by the Greens and, indeed, by the many individuals in the community who are concerned about our continuing reliance on chemical use. The Greens are pleased to recognise that Western Australia has joined other states in supporting the National Registration Authority report and the recommendations of the inquiry into the use of organochlorine insecticides for termite control. The result of these recommendations is that the federal government will not import heptachlor or chlordane from September 1994, except for the Northern Territory's needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens also commend the NRA's improved handling of the inquiry into the organochlorine issue during which it gave the community the opportunity to express its views. I am saying this in the awareness that there has been criticism of the NRA's process to date, and I trust that it takes these comments and criticisms on board. This was the first instance of a successful application of a national approach to these issues. There are many other issues facing the NRA, including the review of pesticides&mdash;the use of pesticides and the availability of pesticides on the supermarket shelves that should not be there because they are too toxic for the public to handle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example is thimet, which is a pesticide used to kill aphids and is extremely acutely toxic&mdash;more toxic than arsenic. It should, under no circumstances, be available to the public to use so freely. I shudder to think about the potential hazards for the 10 per cent of members of our society who are illiterate and are, therefore, unlikely to know about the toxicity of thimet and the need for careful handling of this pesticide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have a great concern with old chemicals that continue to be used. Some chemicals were registered a long time ago and the information on them is inadequate, yet we continue to use them. Something needs to be done about a chemical like atrazine which may be contaminating our surface or ground water. Perhaps more attention needs to be given to the environmental effects of these chemicals in Australian conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, though, if the approach to the serious continuing problems we face with pesticide use is met with openness and efficiency, Australian society can look to making reforms in this area. While I look forward to being able to support the work of the NRA in the future, I also have a complaint that needs airing. In answer to a question by my colleague Senator Christabelle Chamarette&mdash;that is, question No. 1104&mdash;the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) explained on behalf of the NRA that in its opinion the National Health and Medical Research Council report on the organochlorine pesticides was being misquoted because of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ambiguity in parts and some apparent contradiction between the report and public statements by those who are closely associated with it.</PARA>
<PARA>The example the NRA cited was a statement by Dr Duggin, Chairman of the NHMRC working party compiling the report, who said that in respect of organochlorine insecticides `there are major human health concerns'. At the same time, the NHMRC states that organochlorine insecticides `appear to be free of serious health effects in humans at current levels of exposure'. Yet these two statements are not contradictory at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern to me that the NRA apparently does not understand this point. In many cases, animal studies and other non-human data will cause toxicologists to have serious concern about a pesticide's effect in humans, yet there will be no evidence for serious health effects in humans. Toxicologists suggest withdrawing, restricting or not registering a pesticide only rarely on the basis of demonstrated serious health effects in humans, partly because it is either impossible to get such human data or very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human data is difficult to obtain, for example, when a whole population is exposed to a chemical because there is no unexposed population with which to compare the exposed population. Such is the case with the organochlorines. Yet this does not rule out the possibility that serious health effects, for example cancer, are occurring. Toxicologists may be concerned about the probability of these effects occurring, even when they think the risk of cancer and other effects is small, when the whole population is exposed to a chemical. In other words, the risk of serious effects occurring is only small but because the risk is taken by the whole population, the low</PARA>
<PARA>level risk becomes a serious concern to public health officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the two statements together can be seen to represent the precautionary principle to which the state and federal governments and, I hope, the NRA are committed through the intergovernment agreement on the environment and are, therefore, far from contradictory. The inevitable conclusion from all of this is that the NRA board either should have greater access to public health expertise or that in the future it should avoid making pronouncements on matters of health. </PARA>

There is a joint arrangement with ADI and Intermarine Spa, which is an Italian company with leading edge technology. It will be building the combat proven Italian Gaeta class vessel, which is of state-of-the-art glass reinforced plastic. That particular technology will bring enormous opportunities to develop high-tech industries in the Hunter in the areas of advanced sonar, data processing and information systems. Hopefully, it will bring other defence work and shipbuilding work to the Hunter region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most exciting thing about this project, in terms of industrial development, is probably these new fibreglass plastic composites. Research is now going on by ADI and others to actually develop this product for a more extensive use than shipbuilding. It is hoped that by the latter part of this decade it will be possible to use this type of technology in the development of materials for cars, whitegoods and furniture. So it will have a real opportunity to develop new industries and to re-establish the reputation of the Hunter as one of the leading industrial centres of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some concerns about the readiness of the region for this possible future expansion. We would urge the federal Labor government to help develop a proper infrastructure plan for the region. In recent years, there have been a number of welcome developments in this area, particularly in the area of rail and the F3. But the area is not properly linked with the rest of the economy at this stage. There needs to be more road works and port works. The development of a proper aircraft facility would be very useful for the region as it would bring other industries into the region. That needs to be developed now so that this new industry and the support industries that it will attract can develop. It will really help bring down the unemployment levels in this region of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have fears as to whether the sort of development needed will occur. My fears are based on the government's recently released paper on regional development in response to the Kelty inquiry. That turned out to be a totally damp squib. It responded in a very minor way to the regional needs of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional Australia needs further infrastructure development to help it compete with the big centres. We did not see anything like that in the government's response to the green paper. We will call on the federal government to put proper infrastructure into regional Australia so that areas such as the Hunter can achieve their full potential. In the meantime, we have one good first step in all of this. It is great news for the Hunter. It is long overdue. All involved at the federal, state and local level should be congratulated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this week I gave notice of a motion to acknowledge that this week was schizophrenia awareness week. Yesterday my colleagues Senator Tambling and Senator Patterson spoke on this issue in the matters of public interest debate. I thought it was important that I speak tonight because I want to acknowledge the Schizophrenia Australia Foundation's report on care of the seriously mentally ill in Australia. It is a rating of state and regional programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the report that the results indeed are disturbing in this regard. It is a particularly important week for all Australians as mental illness is a disease that is suffered not only by the individual but by the community as a whole. The families and friends of those with mental illness should never by overlooked in the way this government has ignored the mentally ill in Australia. The report looked at staffing, access to day-care facilities, hospital access and general services tailored for the mentally ill. Of my home state of Queensland, the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">How many times can we say that a region is a disgrace? If you were a person with severe mental illness in the South Coast region, we would advise you to cross the border and live in New South Wales. It will take a massive effort and a massive amount of cash to improve significantly in the region, and there is no sign of either from the Queensland Government . . . If you have a serious mental illness in Queensland&mdash;migrate!</PARA>
<PARA>Queensland spends less per capita on mental health services than any other state. The report highlights what are frankly scary statistics, such as the Wide Bay region where there are three staff specialised in mental illness for a region with a population of 100,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Brisbane, the Wolston Park Hospital, the largest mental hospital in Australia, has a waiting list of between two and three years. With Queensland's population growing at a rate ahead of all other states, particularly in the south coast region, the problem of care for the mentally ill in Queensland is even more evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Central and North Queensland areas received even lower ratings than the south-east corner. It is stated that the mental patient facilities in Townsville are `oppressive, over-crowded and rated as one of the nation's worst admissions ward.' One was the infamous Ward 10-B at Townsville General Hospital, which I understand is closed, but the community is still reeling from that recent scandal and inquiry into the abuse and treatment of patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report concludes that the Queensland government has shown a disregard for the mentally ill and that the state as a whole is no place for a person with serious mental illness. In light of the damning Burdekin report into mental illness in Australia, I would conclude that Australia in general is no place for a person with mental illness. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> Human Rights Commissioner Brian Burdekin, in response to the Queensland government budget for mental health, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should not forget that this state, Queensland, has been described as the worst in Australia by a number of independent reports and this Budget fails to live up to the responsibility or reasonable expectations of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>In a nation where the number one killer of young men aged 18 to 24 is through suicide, it is important to note that up to 90 per cent of all suicide victims are mentally ill. Given this link, we must ask ourselves: are we going to lose more of the already lost generation to youth suicide than we have through the social and economic disenfranchising policies of this decade of Labor government. There was a moving article in Monday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> by a mother of a schizophrenic, and she put it most aptly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are not killing the mentally ill, we are letting them kill themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>This is perhaps the most telling indictment of the government's inaction in the area of mental health. Some of the major areas that are emphasised by the report in desperate need of attention include rural health services, Aboriginal mental health, rehabilitation programs and integration of mental health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These recommendations have the same condemning conclusions as the Burdekin report outlined in its mammoth report into mental illness. Why must the government continue to vacillate over this critical area of health care? This crisis in mental health care is in some ways even more compelling than the crisis that besets the entire health system in this country. It is more compelling because the victims&mdash;that is all we can call them&mdash;are so helpless. They do not have lobby groups; they do not have influence; they do not have the electoral power to give them a voice in the government and the bureaucracy; and, to a large degree, the community refuses to acknowledge their existence. All they have is their suffering and the comfort that their relatives and families provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, just as government, state and federal, must focus on the plight of the mentally ill, of equal importance is support for and recognition of the plight of the families and relatives of the mentally ill. For every mentally ill patient, there are numerous people who are affected by that illness. The suffering of these relatives is so easily dismissed and so often neglected. We must turn our attention</PARA>
<PARA>not just to the mentally ill but also to the impact their ill health has on the community as a whole&mdash;an impact that is made even more burdensome by the inaction of this government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It was not the task of the Committee for Quality Assurance in Higher Education to rank institutions, from 1 to 36, unlike similar quality assessment exercises overseas. Rather, the Committee grouped institutions into bands of institutions which demonstrated like characteristics with regard to their quality assurance processes and outcomes. The Committee stated in its report that it did not believe that the information available to it could justify rank-ordering by institution. There was, however, adequate information available to it to group institutions and rank the groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) All institutions in the Unified National Systems volunteered to participate in the program and agreed to have their quality assurance processes and outcomes in teaching and learning, research and community service assessed within the context of their missions and goals.  An important feature of the approach is the emphasis on the institution's own mechanisms for self-assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee placed equal emphasis on the three functions&mdash;teaching and learning, research and community service and on processes and outcomes in conducting its assessments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It should be recognised that the Quality Assurance Program is a program to reward excellence. Institutions are paid a base operating grant to deliver high quality educational provision. Those institutions best able to demonstrate effective quality assurance processes and excellent outcomes in the areas under consideration were placed in the top five groups. A sixth group of institutions were assessed as showing improving outcomes with the introduction of systematic processes underway. The groupings are based on an assessment of, and commitment to, systematic quality processes within the institutions, together with the evaluation of outputs over the range of university activities. This approach was emphasised in the guidelines issued by the Committee to institutions choosing to participate in the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee found that all institutions had responded positively to the program and deserved recognition. In view of its finding that there is good evidence of commitment to and achievement of new and revised quality processes in all universities, the Committee recommended to the Minister that groups 1 to 5 receive additional funding which represents a percentage of their operating grant. The percentages ranged from three percent additional funding for group 1 to one percent for group 5. Institutions in groups 1 to 5 are required to expend the funds to maintain or to enhance the quality of higher education particularly in the institution's areas of strength.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee also recommended that institutions in group 6 receive an alternative form of funding to increase the momentum for change.

It is the institutions themselves who have chosen to make ranking an issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, the Committee's overall finding was that the quality across the higher education system in Australia is high with a commitment to, and achievement in, the development of quality processes and significant evidence of excellent outcomes in all universities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) While the Committee recognises that highly qualified staff are an important input to a university's performance, its principal focus was on the quality assurance processes and excellence of the universities' outcomes in this exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the assessment of research output the Committee is aware that there are several ways of calculating research productivity. One of these is on a per capita basis. This is a calculation which tends to favour those universities which have not experienced significant amalgamation with institutions from the former CAE sector. The Committee had regard to these factors in its final judgements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Sound corporate management practices and a collegial approach to decision making are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. The Committee has not proposed any particular management model to the universities; rather it has suggested that it is their responsibility to demonstrate good quality assurance processes. Processes such as systematic feedback mechanisms directly benefit key stakeholders such as students who are one of the beneficiaries of this program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The quality assurance program was designed to recognise institutions with a high level of performance in teaching and learning and community service as well as in research. Those institutions best able to demonstrate effective quality assurance processes and excellent outcomes would receive the additional funding. The program was not designed to fund research which is funded primarily through the Australian Research Council. The Government is mindful of the research infrastructure issue.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is no formal review into the funding arrangements for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's policy for funding MRI services was examined following representations from the Royal Australasian College of Radiologists for an expansion in Medicare funding. The Government has now considered the issues raised in the submission and has decided that there should be no change to its policy for subsidising the provision of MRI services through Medicare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current policy is based on the results of a comprehensive national MRI assessment program which was established as a joint Commonwealth-State initiative and conducted under the auspices of the National Health Technology Advisory Panel (NHTAP) over the period 1986 to 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy responds to the concerns of the Commonwealth and State Governments that complex and high cost technologies like MRI are introduced in a planned and cost-effective way. Accordingly, the policy for Medicare funding of MRI services targets subsidies to a set number of publicly owned MRI units via a grants program to States. Based on NHTAP's recommendations, a national supply target of 18 MRI units has been set to meet the needs of both private (non-compensable) patients and Medicare hospital patients, mainly for neurological and neurosurgical applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the MRI program, the Commonwealth provides capital grants to States for the purchase of MRI units and about 80 per cent of recurrent costs.
