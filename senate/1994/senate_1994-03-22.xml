We know his attitude towards the Senate. That is reinforced by both ministers, in the same area, not attending the chamber today, when one of the most critical issues on the national agenda is the intention of the government to increase the Medicare tax. The government intends to do that. The first minister in the area is absent from the Senate today. The second minister, in the area of family services, is absent as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that at least someone is interested in high matters of state in this parliament. It was a very statesman-like question on a very important subject. I am glad that at least one person in this place is approaching this in the proper spirit and with the proper appreciation of what this parliament is supposed to be about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the question that I was asked about North Korean nuclear capability and the current situation that exists there, the situation is this: the Board of Governors of the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, met yesterday, 21 March, under Australian chairmanship and adopted a resolution on the DPRK nuclear issue. The resolution, which we co-sponsored, expresses grave concern at North Korea's  failure to allow the IAEA to conduct essential safeguard activities at its most sensitive declared nuclear sites and calls upon the DPRK immediately to cooperate with the IAEA to implement its safeguard obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The resolution also importantly asks the IAEA director-general to report to the UN Security Council on North Korea's non-compliance, which the board has an obligation to do under the terms of its statute.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution is a measure of the seriousness with which the international community regards this issue. It reflects our determination to ensure that the DPRK abides by its commitments under the NPT not to develop nuclear weapons and to allow full international verification of its nuclear activities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring the issue to the UN Security Council does not necessarily mean an immediate move to impose economic or any other sanctions on North Korea. The fact that the security council will again simply consider this issue should itself be a further significant signal to the DPRK. Certainly, unless the DPRK takes a more cooperative approach and fulfils its undertakings, we are likely to see measured and gradual moves in the council towards punitive action, while every attempt is made at the same time to seek a resolution through dialogue and negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said on a number of other occasions, it is our hope here in Australia that a long-term solution to this problem can still be found through negotiation. We sent a message to North Korea ourselves last Friday urging it to allow IAEA inspections to be completed as a means of restarting the dialogue process. Regrettably, the DPRK has not so far seen its interests as apparently being best served by proceeding in this fashion. But we hope that, with the pressure that is being mounted and the attitude of the international community being made clear, North Korea will&mdash;as it has on previous occasions&mdash;consider its position. The government will be following developments closely and, of course, we will support any action that is considered necessary by the security council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have already had our semantic discussion on this particular subject on at least half a dozen previous occasions. The nature of the promise that was made at the last election was in terms of not doing anything that would add to the total taxation burden. In any event, it is not the case that a jobs levy would be regarded as a tax increase but rather as a levy which is traditionally, technically, regarded as quite different, and traditionally regarded by the Senate as something quite different from taxation because of its implications for the way the legislation proceeds. Beyond that, I have nothing further to add.

The nature of our broad commitments to the tax system and the level of taxation in this country has been made absolutely clear; we have debated it on a dozen occasions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the case that Japan's prototype fast breeder reactor, Monju, is due to reach criticality in April this year. That is not news; I think that has been anticipated for some time. I am surprised that Senator Coulter has suddenly decided to get excited about it. Japan's nuclear energy program has for some time provided Japan with access to separated plutonium. The point about that plutonium, and any new plutonium that might be generated by this particular addition to Japan's energy capability, is that it is strictly safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency in accordance with Japan's obligations as a party to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty. Those safeguards provide very strict controls to ensure that all nuclear material is used exclusively for peaceful non-explosive purposes and is fully accounted for. All Australian supplied uranium to Japan is also, of course, subject to the stringent conditions of Australia's bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement with Japan. As to the second group of questions asked by Senator Coulter, Japan is a party in good standing to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty under which non-nuclear weapon states, parties to the NPT, renounce any intention to acquire nuclear weapons. Japan announced last year its support for the treaty's indefinite extension beyond 1995. A particular attribute of the NPT, as the central pillar of the international nonproliferation regime, is that countries which have attained sufficient scientific and technological competence to develop nuclear weapons&mdash;certainly Japan is in that category&mdash;nonetheless forswear that option through internationally, legally binding commitments. The Australian government accepts Japan's clear and frequent statements that, as a fundamental principle, it will not possess plutonium in excess of the amount required for its nuclear fuel recycling power program.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Indonesian troops in Australia are using special-purpose Australian training facilities in Perth to undertake aircraft counter-hijacking training. Such training has potential relevance to the protection of Australian lives and property in the event that Australian aircraft travellers are caught up in a hijack incident. There are no plans for counter-insurgency training to be provided by Australian forces.</PARA>

That is why I felt very insulted this morning by the degree of snide questioning about this. We have made it very clear that the government has provided information with respect to the costs, but daily rates have been kept in confidence because, to do otherwise, would damage the bargaining position of government when we do go out and buy legal services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understood that there are no further developments planned for the Salisbury Campus and that the consolidation of faculties would eventually lead to a move from the Salisbury Campus to the Levels Campus. I point out as a South Australian senator that the distance from Salisbury Campus to the Levels Campus is only a few kilometres, so it is not a great distance. It is on the major transport route in Main North Road through the northern suburbs of Adelaide. So it is not as though it is going from one side of Adelaide to the other.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the particular aspect about equity, I am further advised that all institutions are required to have an equity strategy within their educational profile.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The economic research wing of my portfolio, the Bureau of Industry Economics, published on 16 March another benchmark study, this time in electricity generation and supply in Australia. This is part of a series of benchmark studies in which we compare the efficiency of industry sectors in Australia with the best performed industry sectors elsewhere in the world in order to identify the performance gap, if there is any, and encourage those sectors to become globally the most efficient of all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This study was into electricity generation and supply. It found that prices for electricity in Australia affect all businesses right across the board. Some are more intensive than others, but if we can reduce the cost of electricity tariffs we make a major input saving to Australian business and hence improve its competitiveness worldwide. Roughly three to five per cent of all industry costs in Australia are incurred by the purchase of electricity.</PARA>

I have explained to the Senate on numerous occasions, including in that disallowance debate, that there were discussions between the comptroller-general and me. As a result of those discussions Mr Kelly resigned as comptroller-general. Further discussions took place with appropriate officials in the Commonwealth Public Service, which led to Mr Kelly being offered a job commensurate with his skill. I have explained on many occasions that even the Conroy review said that customs is to be congratulated for what it has been doing on an international level, in the introduction of electronic systems, paperless systems, and international customs harmonisation, in which Mr Kelly has played a leading role. Therefore, it was quite appropriate that Mr Kelly be offered the job of consultant to DITARD for a couple of years as we develop those processes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a very positive story to tell in this respect. The meat and livestock industry was our largest agricultural export earner in 1992-93, and the potential exists to significantly boost its earning capacity by moving into the higher value added food product sector. The impediment to achieving that potential is as Peter Roberts correctly points out in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. He states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The meat industry is well aware of the potential for further value adding. The industry is encouraging the adoption of new technologies and innovations through the Meat Research Corporation. As I said before in the Senate, I think the best thing that John Kerin did, among a lot of good things, was to set up that series of research corporations and councils in 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MRC is jointly funded to around $50 million a year by the government and meat industry levy payers. The MRC approached the government in late 1991 proposing to develop a fund to invest in rural innovations. The government supported the proposal. Following consultation with the meat and livestock peak industry councils, it was decided to set up the agribusiness trust fund. The agribusiness trust account is a subsidiary of the MRC and is managed by Hambro-Grantham Ltd. It will invest in companies which commercialise the results of research and development to the benefit of the meat and livestock industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trust will hold less than 50 per cent equity in each of its investments. It will operate on a strictly commercial profit objective and decisions will be based on stringent commercial and financial criteria. The MRC has set aside around $5 million for the trust fund over the next three years and this could leverage to over $15 million for commercialisation of new technologies. The actual size of the fund will depend upon the availability of investment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement of the trust coincides with the trust's first investment which is in a food processing software company, Sastek Pty Ltd, which will commercialise video imaging analysis technology that has been developed by the MRC. The investment involves the progressive acquisition of up to 25 per cent of Sastek, which is an $11 million company specialising in the design, manufacture and supply of management information systems for food processing industries. The government welcomes the establishment of the agribusiness development trust account. It is  an approach that should help increase the adoption of new technologies and innovations by our extremely important beef export industry. This is yet another demonstration of the success of government working with industry to build on their competitive strength and develop a greater value added export base for the future.</PARA>

If no action is taken at all, it can only leave the public with the impression that we as a Senate, as a parliamentary chamber, believe that that sort of political tactic by a minister is an acceptable form of bringing a political debate to an end.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hold on a moment. Firstly, I feel for the victims, and the children of the Holocaust. Secondly, I made the point that I resented then, as now, the way that the opposition has taken a penny-pinching approach to the pursuance of the war crimes trials. Senator Vanstone, wanting to ask about costs, comes in here today and says, `Well, I've pursued these questions because I want to ensure that people in these cases have adequate and competent representation'. The cost details were provided, but not the daily rates. I made it very clear that we could provide information on the daily rates in confidence. That information can still be provided in confidence, as is quite often done in relation to commercial-in-confidence transactions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this point was pursued this morning by Senator Vanstone, she made the point that she was pursuing it not to ensure that everyone had fair and adequate representation, but because she was concerned that we were `fixing up our mates'.

I went on to say that I felt this particular line of attack was insulting. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is like arguing about the tariff of the gas at Auschwitz.</PARA>
<PARA>I have had a long concern about this issue, which has been expressed in my chairing of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that I could have expressed my distaste in a better way than I did this morning. I could have judged it better, but I stress that I was expressing my distaste. If my comments caused offence to anybody then I truly apologise. My motivation on this matter is not to insult those victims or children of the victims, but to ensure that we, as a nation, can stand up in the international community and say quite clearly and fairly that we did everything within our capacity to track down those who might have been responsible for these horrendous crimes. That has been my consistent point of view. My motivation was that, having been frustrated by this unreasonable pursuance of this information by the other side, I felt offended. I apologise if, for some people, the comments were distasteful&mdash;I imagine that they may well have been, and I regret having used them.

In those circumstances there has always been a mechanism&mdash;people have decided not to pursue it keenly in order to make political points, but have been prepared to sit down with the government and accept that in some circumstances the information can be commercial-in-confidence. That mechanism was available this morning, and is now. If members of the opposition are serious about this, they should sit down with us and accept that information. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for people to understand what the situation is&mdash;otherwise they cannot understand the urgency with which we want to consider this matter. Time and again the question was put&mdash;I think it was six times, but it might have been eight&mdash;to the minister asking him to provide the daily rates paid to defence counsel in the war crimes trials. The argument was put that when one knows the daily rate paid to a counsel one can get some idea, but not a complete one, of the level of competence of that counsel. Then, at the next estimates committee one can get the daily rate paid to the prosecuting counsel in this matter, and get an idea whether this legislation has been administered fairly. I do not believe that those questions are in any way inconsistent with the sentiments expressed by Senator Bolkus. If he genuinely believes what he said&mdash;which I think he does&mdash;that these people ought to be dealt with and that we should play our part internationally, he must agree that we have to play that part fairly. He must agree that the prosecution should have an equal chance with the defence, and that the defence should have an equal chance with the prosecution. One should not be inhibited in any way as opposed to the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says he is happy to make public the total amounts paid to the separate counsel. But that is no help, because someone who is paid $5,000 a day and works for 10 days gets $50,000; but someone might get $50,000 for 20 days work and only be paid $2,500 a day. The daily rate of $2,500 versus $5,000 does not tell us that one lawyer is twice as good as another, but it does give us an indication of the level of counsel that the government sought to give each side. Surely, to conduct these trials as fairly as possible, we would want to have counsel of roughly equal competence, and I do not think that is an unfair question to pursue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says, `You can have the information about daily rates on a confidential basis'. What good is that? If I find that the daily rates are so disproportionate that I want to make the claim that each side was not dealt with fairly, how can I let Senator Chamarette know, for example, or Senator Kernot, Senator Harradine or anyone else? I just have to know privately that the wrong thing was done&mdash;if I believe that is the case. So to offer it in confidence is no help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that the time is coming very near when legal counsel in any matter&mdash;let alone the war crimes trials&mdash;will not be entitled, when they have their hands in the Commonwealth till, to be protected from parliament or the taxpayers knowing on what basis their fees are calculated. We have the cost of justice inquiry being run by a committee of this chamber, which acknowledges that the government is an extraordinarily large user of legal services. It should be using its power to reduce those services, and one way it could do that is by having an open market in this matter and releasing the daily fees. At the last estimates we were told by Mr Rose from the department that all bars know there is this hefty discount; all bars in Australia work for the Commonwealth for hefty discounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put the case that there is no commercial-in-confidence to protect. I say that to indicate the perfectly placid nature of the estimates committee until, suddenly this morning, the minister decided to interject with his quite offensive remark that the proper pursuit of these questions was tantamount to arguing over the price of gas at Auschwitz. I was simply astounded. It is the most tasteless remark I have heard from anybody since I have been in parliament.

To have suggestions made of that kind, if indeed they were made, as Senator Bolkus says they were, is to create an environment in which one can readily understand someone responding emotionally and saying, `Well, you have really just missed the whole point as to what these war crimes proceedings were about'. </PARA>

He has frankly and straightforwardly acknowledged that the use of the expression in question was a misjudged one. He has explained the context in which he used the expression in question. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was at the hearing of Estimates Committee F this morning, and for that reason I wish to say a few words in very strong support of Senator Hill's motion. I think the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will show quite unequivocally that Senator Vanstone this morning was pursuing a totally legitimate line of questioning about the expenditure of public money on legal fees and the principle of this government's use of the commercial in confidence defence in refusing to disclose details of legal fees paid by the government in pursuit of its activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that for some reason&mdash;I do not think any of us really understood the reason&mdash;Senator Bolkus appeared to be extremely sensitive about this issue and took great offence. This afternoon his explanation to the Senate for his extreme sensitivity seemed to me to be quite patently inadequate. Surely other things must have contributed to his view. As a result his whole approach was totally obstructive and was very provocative indeed. His statement, to which the coalition takes such great offence, really came out of the blue. To accuse a member of parliament of either house by saying that the pursuit of legitimate questions was like arguing about the tariff on gas at Auschwitz is a totally unacceptable statement, almost regardless of the provocation. It is even more unacceptable when that alleged provocation was the pursuit of a quite legitimate line of questioning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the estimate committee hearing, both Senator Vanstone and I asked Senator Bolkus to withdraw his remark. We drew attention to the fact that the relevant standing orders of the Senate also govern the conduct of Senate committees, including estimates committees. Senator Bolkus refused to withdraw. In the Senate this afternoon we again asked him to withdraw. Again, he refused. Senator Bolkus, by his refusal to withdraw in the Senate this afternoon, has quite clearly contravened standing order 193(3) which says that a senator shall not use offensive words against any member of either house and that all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those members shall be considered highly disorderly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is no reasonable conclusion that anyone could come to in this matter other than that Senator Bolkus contravened standing order 193(3) in the most offensive and obscene way that I have ever seen a member of parliament so contravene that standing order. He stands condemned for that, and that is the reason Senator Hill moved the motion in the terms that he did. It is all the more deplorable that a minister for immigration and ethnic affairs should use the terms that Senator Bolkus used. Senator Bolkus should unconditionally withdraw the remarks he made today in the estimates committee hearing. He stands condemned anyway. He will stand condemned for the rest of his parliamentary life if he does not now withdraw them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short said a little while ago that Senator Bolkus's actions were the most offensive and most obscene that he has seen in this parliament. Senator Short entered this parliament at the same time as I did but, obviously, he was not in the chamber or tuned into his television set on Thursday night of last week when one of his colleagues&mdash;I think it was the colleague who sits beside him&mdash;took advantage of this place and the privilege that we have by getting stuck into and attacking the mayor of Townsville, a local government member, a person who does not have an opportunity to defend himself. In a sense, that is a double standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone said the committee meeting this morning was of a placid nature. It was hardly of a placid nature because the first thing we started talking about at 8 a.m. was when we would have time to meet again to conclude the job that had been given to this particular Senate estimates committee by the Senate. It could hardly be described as a placid meeting&mdash;and that was only the start of it. We then talked about the questions put on notice at the estimates committee by the relevant senators. Of course, the first question related to the issue in front of Senator Bolkus which led to his uttering the unfortunate words&mdash;words for which he has since apologised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of double standards is that, on one occasion when there was an intervention by the chair on a point of order, the minister was asked to withdraw the words, `Shut up', which he had directed to one of the committee members.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the Senate will allow me to steer this debate back to some relevance, let us look at standing order 209 which talks of urgent necessity. The issue that we have before us is the conduct of Senator Bolkus at an estimates committee meeting earlier today. The question of behaviour at Senate standing committees and otherwise is pertinent today and it certainly requires some urgent attention. It is a topical matter and, therefore, one which should be disposed of today, and that is the reason for the urgent necessity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the legitimate line of questioning by Senator Vanstone in relation to the hourly rates of solicitors as paid by the government. In reply to that we got from Senator Bolkus the statement that her questions were `like arguing about the tariff of the gas at Auschwitz'. That sort of reply is entirely inappropriate. It is not conducive to the carrying out of proper affairs in Senate committees. I think that it is appropriate for this chamber to express its opinion firmly in relation to how senators conduct themselves in Senate standing committees and estimates committees. After all, we are there for the good government of this country and the people of Australia should be able to place their trust in us that we will carry out our affairs in a proper and appropriate fashion in accordance with standing order 193 without resorting to such&mdash;I would submit&mdash;offensive language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone's inquiry is a proper one. It deals with the hourly rates applicable to solicitors. I can tell honourable senators that if a solicitor works for the Legal Aid Commission there is a public rate of pay. There is no commercial confidentiality about that at all. I do not think it would place the government in a lesser bargaining position if this were to be made public. In fact, I think it would increase the government's position, allow some sort of competition between practitioners and give a greater deduction to the Commonwealth and, indirectly, to the people of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to briefly address that motion, and I understand that there may be some debate on it. I do not have any pleasure in moving this motion, but the need for it has arisen because of the very small amount of legislation that the Senate was able to debate last week. Honourable senators will recall that last Monday there was no time for government business. On that day there was an MPI, a first speech and a ministerial statement on Macedonia which took considerable time. On Tuesday, all available time was taken up with debating three disallowance motions. On Wednesday and Thursday there was a continuation of the disallowance debate and also considerable interest and involvement in the question of the disclosure of the pecuniary interests of senators. Consequently, at this stage, we have a backlog of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a serious backlog but we do have 10 packages of bills to debate, four of which are in the committee stage, and we have three messages to receive from the House of Representatives. I estimate, and I have told Senator Hill this privately, that we need nine to 10 hours of government business time to complete the program. If we get a reasonable amount of time today, including the additional two hours tonight which are sought in this motion, we may not need further late night sittings this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always difficult&mdash;as I think all honourable senators know&mdash;to make any hard and fast predictions about what is going to occur with the Senate's business timetable. I do not intend to make those predictions, but as a precaution I would be proposing tomorrow to look at the issue of the Senate either negating or perhaps curtailing to some extent its general business debate on Thursday, if that is agreed amongst the parties in the Senate. There is the less palatable option of finishing our program on Friday. However, I believe that there will be no need for the Senate to negate tomorrow. I think we can see our program completed with a little more increase in government business time and, I hope, cooperation from all senators&mdash;opposition, minor parties and Independents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that it is not the government's intention to negate the adjournment tomorrow night but to make an assessment by the close of play tomorrow about how we are travelling with our program. If there is a need to make any adjustments for Thursday, the appropriate adjustments will be made at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to second guess any contribution that Senator Hill may make in this debate. However, I predict that he may claim that this motion indicates some lack of success, or failure, in the new timetable. I do not think that that would be a fair conclusion to draw in any sense. In fact, I would strongly disagree with that. The new timetable of sittings and routine of business have meant that the Senate, throughout this particular session, has been able to rise by 8 o'clock each day and even the extra sitting hours proposed in this motion will mean that the Senate will rise at what used to be its normal finishing time. That clearly is a preferable arrangement to the previous situation when, at the end of the normal parliamentary session, there was a negation of the adjournment at 10.30 p.m. and we worked into the wee small hours of the morning. This is a responsible approach by the government&mdash;sensible, given the constraints of our legislative program&mdash;of which notice has been given for a substantial period of time. I urge all senators to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will oppose this motion. It is inconsistent with the programming and timetable that were forced upon us. We voted against this not very long ago when we were told that late night sittings were unhealthy and, therefore, would not be imposed upon the Senate in the future. There was great determination on the part of the government, the Democrats and the Greens that the Senate would not sit later than 8.00 p.m. Here we are, on the first occasion when that is put to the test, and we find the government getting together with the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;the team, as we tend to refer to them these days&mdash;and deciding that they will breach their own determination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the numbers being as they are in this place, our view becomes somewhat irrelevant. It is sometimes forgotten that when the Greens, the Democrats and the government join together, as they so often do, we become a minority. We did protest at the time that this new system was imposed, and I think its shortcomings have now been demonstrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has made a concession&mdash;which I recognise&mdash;in that he is now prepared to undertake that he and the minority parties will not seek to impose the longer hours on the Senate tomorrow night. I respond positively to that; it is more of a concession than we had earlier today. He has acknowledged that he may well be seeking a further late night extension on Thursday, which is scheduled to be the last sitting day of this session. The point is that with proper planning this should have been unnecessary. The Senate sat a lot earlier this year than it has in the past&mdash;coming back near the beginning of February&mdash;to enable the government to better plan its program within a time frame that, according to the government, would not require night sittings. At its first test, it has failed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sought today to pass blame for that to us, which is its usual practice, but it was not our decision last week to bring upon the Senate the debate on senators' interests. It was the government's determination to get that through the Senate last week pursuant to another arrangement that it had made with the Australian Democrats and the Greens&mdash;another team effort. It was an item of business to take precedence ahead of all government legislation, notwithstanding that the government for 10 years has played around with the issue. It has brought it on occasionally and dropped it&mdash;in some instances, for up to two years&mdash;before bringing it back again. But last week it had to be the item that took precedence over all other items, including government business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that last week the government got a bit behind in its schedule. The problem is not made any better by the fact that government members failed to attend the chamber, were counted out, and therefore lost time. One might ask the question: why does the Senate now have to suffer a night sitting&mdash;which we were told it was so important to avoid&mdash;simply because government members failed to attend during the scheduled time? It does seem incredible that when the government fails to keep its own quorum the Australian Democrats and the Greens say, `Never mind. We will join with you to extend the Senate into a night sitting' so shortly after the Democrats and the Greens told us it was critical to avoid night sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the good faith of the government in this matter was tested, and a lack of good faith was demonstrated, in relation to the estimates committees. Apparently sitting late at night on an estimates committee does not harm our health, but sitting late at night in this chamber does. Again, with the first test we found that the new sitting hours, in the government's eyes, did not apply to estimates committees. If those committees sat late, that was too bad, notwithstanding the health consequences. So we have had late night sittings of estimates committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, but none of these concerns were taken into account. It was convenient to the government when it suggested that this committee sit at half-past six in the morning. It is now convenient to the government that the Senate should sit tonight, and, as I said, the Greens and the Democrats roll over whenever the government seems to call them in these days. That is what will occur because the government has the numbers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we are debating this change to the timetable, I put on the record a couple of extra protests. We said at the time of the changes to the timetable that we were concerned about the changes being made to the adjournment debate. We conceded that often there is not an adjournment debate, and sometimes it is a short one, but argued that on some occasions there are issues of significance that will take longer than the maximum 40 minutes allowed. That has been demonstrated to be the case. The problem with that is if the government, the Democrats and the Greens, come in and want to participate in that 40 minutes then we, not being a majority, but certainly the largest group in this chamber, are lucky to get in one small contribution during that debate. That has been demonstrated not to work satisfactorily&mdash;certainly not from our perspective. It suits the government and the minority parties, but it is the opposition that is being restricted. For the next session, I register my protest at what is occurring in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the government conceded during the debate on setting a new procedural structure for the Senate that the ability to take note of matters that arise during question time should become a right and not require leave. Its purpose is basically to enable opposition and minor parties to take note of matters that arise out of government answers because question time is clearly stacked against an opposition. We have just one minute to ask the question; ministers have four minutes to answer it. We argued that it should be three, but again the Democrats joined with the government to make it four. As it is televised, it is again biased against an opposition's interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concession was generously made that we should have the right to take note of those matters after question time. What is happening now is that government members are coming in and participating in that process, again stacking the debate so that that right is, in effect, being lost. That is an abuse of the spirit in which that compromise was reached, and I therefore put on notice my protest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already protested about the long hours that the estimates committees are sitting, the fact that there was not sufficient time scheduled within this program to allow for the proper and reasonable functioning of the estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, whilst the minister has said that the new framework is working satisfactorily, on this side of the chamber that is not our view. Therefore, no case has been made out for the need to vary this timetable today to enable this later night sitting tonight. As the minister said, there is now not a lot of legislation before the chamber, and some of that is non-controversial and not expected to take a long time. In fact, the one I am involved in later today I doubt will take more than a few minutes. But, that has not been put to the test because before we get towards the end of the program the government joins with the minor parties to extend the sitting of the Senate. It may well be found by Thursday that this later night sitting tonight, in breach of the government's undertakings given at the beginning of this session, was unnecessary. But that will never be put to the test because the government cannot wait. It is determined to come in here and extend tonight's sitting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that we have not seen much improvement by the government in managing its program as we have moved along this path under the new timetable. If there were one or two bills that could not be dealt with it would not matter much because we are back here in just over a month, and there is very little legislation on the program that could not have waited to be dealt with at that time. In fact, that is how the new system was supposed to work&mdash;there would be a flow-over if the time for debate expired within the time frames that the government and the minor parties had set for this Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, therefore, vote against this proposal. In our view, the case has not been made out. I regret that the numbers are such that we shall lose, but nevertheless we believe it is important to protest again at this incompetent program. </PARA>

If they are meeting at the times that people have told me about, we might have to look at that. There are some difficulties. My estimates committee adjourned at 10 past 12 on the first night. We were delayed in starting because of this chamber. I have to say that when there are four departments in a night, and two have been gone through and there are just two smaller ones left, to adjourn at 11 o'clock and come back at another time is inconvenient.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to illustrate that by an example of where things have got out of hand. In Estimates Committee C on Tuesday, 1 March this year&mdash;I remind the chamber that that is three weeks ago today&mdash;I raised a series of questions with regard to an $8 million allocation of funds for the Subiaco Oval in Western Australia. I made some very important points and addressed a number of fundamental questions with regard to both the bureaucratic and the political decision-making process of that $8 million allocation. </PARA>

There were links to Mr Dawkins, the then Treasurer; there were links to the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe; there were links to Dr Carmen Lawrence who, at the time we were inquiring into, was the Labor Premier of Western Australia. Maybe for government reasons, and because an election involving Dr Lawrence was coming up in Western Australia in the intervening period, the government would not provide any of that information to Estimates Committee C. I was seeking in particular&mdash;and I refer to page C166 and onwards of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> for 1 March&mdash;a lot of information that required the minister, and I think it was Senator Crowley on that occasion, and the chairman of the committee, Senator Reynolds, to pursue with Minister Howe access to ministerial correspondence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the estimates committee again met on Thursday, 17 March, none of that information had been provided. I sought it again in more detail. It was very obvious from the information that was given to us by departmental officers that the information had been tendered to Mr Howe's office. All of the correspondence that I was seeking between Mr Howe, Mr Dawkins and Dr Lawrence had very important overtones and, as it turned out from some other departmental information that flowed, an implication that also linked the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to this area. It became obvious that there was probably a good deal of correspondence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is out of whack, and tonight we are being forced to consider other legislation because the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party have obviously cooked up a deal. But they are not giving proper consideration to the issues that should be evolving. I am pointing out only one particular issue: this Subiaco Oval con job where $8 million has been going round in little circles for nearly three years and where surreptitious deals have been done between Mr Keating, Mr Dawkins, Dr Lawrence and Mr Howe. We cannot get the information from Senator Crowley, and we cannot get it from Senator Reynolds under the committee system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the committee the other night, there is obviously camouflage and subterfuge with regard to this very important project. It smells. We want to deal with it, but we are being forced off to other estimates committee meetings at dawn tomorrow morning. As Senator Patterson said, there was a request for one committee to meet this morning at 6.30. How ridiculous! That is then compounded in other areas of the committee. It proves that government management is totally out of control. When it comes to a cover-up, the government is the supreme expert at trying to rig the agenda and at trying to control the flow of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will not be any time for a debate on this issue if, as I suspect, this correspondence shows that there probably should be a much more substantive debate in this chamber during this week's program on such an important issue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Robert Ray said that members of the government should take turn in taking note of answers. He and a few others on the government side of the chamber must have a short memory. The concept of taking note of answers was introduced to let the opposition have its say following question time.

The government need not have worried about senators' interests; it could have had the legislative program ready. The Government Whip should have had the numbers in here when the quorum was called.

I also thought I heard him say that if we are on track we might not sit Thursday night.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply say this: all that these changes of rules have achieved is that the coalition has been restricted in the opportunities it has to debate very important matters. Certainly we have not had any restriction in the time that the Senate sits. Sure, we finish at 8 o'clock sometimes but, when it suits the government, we go back to 10.30 p.m. When we finish early there are meetings of joint committees, estimates committees and Senate committees which carry on and on. So none of these pious promises we got during the debate have in any way helped. We heard the expressions&mdash;the insincere expressions, I might say&mdash;of concern as to the health of senators. All that is just rubbish. The whole purpose of these changes was so that the Labor Party could restrict us, and it has done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray, in his very calm and apparently reasoned way, said, `Well, if you are having trouble with the adjournment, we will look at that. If you are having trouble with seeking to take note, we will look at that. If you are having trouble with matters of public interest, we will have a look at that'. Senator Ray also said that we accuse government senators of not participating in debate. We do accuse them of that, and we do not object when they do. In fact, we would like to hear a bit more genuine debate from the other side. I must say that when they get up, what we hear is usually pretty much hogwash&mdash;there is nothing in it at all. But we would like them to get involved in debate. What we object to is that, when they do get involved, they take up the little time that we have to raise these very important measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party knows all about curtailing the adjournment debate. It did this very successfully before the Fremantle by-election. It brings in a team of speakers to filibuster so that we cannot make any points. Matters of public interest debates used to be only for us, but now the Labor Party is rostering people to filibuster. Those opposite have never before worried about taking part in such debates. But now, because they see that we are getting a message across, they are rostering people to come in and filibuster. That is what all of this has been about, and these things should be made known. </PARA>

We expect Senator Richardson to know something about health, but where is he? Because Senator Richardson is in a difficult portfolio, because he is under attack, because the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) wants to shuffle him off to Zimbabwe or somewhere else or wants him to take a less strenuous portfolio, what does he do? He does not turn up in this chamber. He was sick for three or four days just at the time when he had some difficult matters to answer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report No. 27 runs across the whole range of ministerial portfolios. All of these reports, in one form or another, have already been presented to the parliament but in this report the Auditor-General has dealt with some follow-up matters. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audit report on the Aggregate Financial Statement prepared by the Minister for Finance for the year ended 30 June 1993 was qualified on the basis that audit reports on underlying departmental financial statements had been qualified on matters which were material in the context of the Aggregate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Audit reports on fifteen departmental financial statements were qualified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the non-departmental area, six statutory authorities and three companies were qualified. The qualifications related to uncertainty of sale values of assets and liabilities; inadequate accounts and records; and accounting and disclosure aspects involving breaches of legislation and accounting standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The key findings of this audit inspection were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Problems still exist with the inclusion of supplementary information on certain assets and liabilities in departmental financial statements. The financial statements of five departments were qualified on the grounds of inadequate accounts and records of assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outstanding accounting issues continue with a number of departments regarding the validity of benefit payments and substantiation of revenues due to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were numerous procedural and controlled breakdowns together with minor and technical non-compliance with Commonwealth laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There remains considerable scope for more timely preparation of financial information subject to audit, together with a need to improve accounts and records and control systems that produce financial information.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to deal at great length with all these matters that the Auditor-General has raised. However, I want to draw a couple of them to the attention of the Senate. The first one relates to the explosives factory at Maribyrnong. The audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report of a preliminary study of Defence's procedures associated with the closure of the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong has commented on Defence's expenditure of some $26m on facilities to produce nitroester and rocket motor propellants, and on procedures to clear and decontaminate the factory site for future development. The report notes that remediation of the site will be expensive and that it will be many years before a suitable use for the site can be determined.</PARA>
<PARA>This has turned into quite a saga. I think the Senate will be concerned about several aspects of this matter. In the first place, I refer to the contamination of the site. This is of major significance. As the Auditor-General reports:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department valued the disposal properties at market value of $231m.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the market value of that Maribyrnong site. The Auditor-General continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Market value represents the amount the Department would expect to receive on disposal less selling costs including those costs associated with making the property saleable.</PARA>
<PARA>Information was not available to the Auditor-General, however, which would allow these costs of making this site saleable to be quantified. However, the Auditor-General says it is possible that these costs could exceed the reported property values. As I said, the reported property value is $231 million, but the costs of decontaminating this land could, according to the Auditor-General, exceed that property value. That is an incredible cost. The cost to decontaminate this land could exceed $231 million. The audit report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO considered that the value of these properties reported by the Department did not reflect the true market value as it did not make allowance for decontamination costs of those properties. The Department advised it did not provide an estimate of the likely costs because relevant information had not been obtained or the uncertainties involved precluded a reliable estimate being formulated. Accordingly, the ANAO was unable to determine the extent of the costs not reflected in the financial statement.</PARA>
<PARA>This kind of cost is, to my mind, absolutely incredible. In fact, the whole question of the Maribyrnong explosives factory astounds me because quite apart from the question of decontamination is the question of some extraordinary expenditures just before the factory moved. To complete the matter of site clearance and contamination, I note that the Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . At the time of closing the Explosives Factory Maribyrnong&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which was in December 1990, as I recall&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there were some 500 building on the 92 hectare site. The site and buildings were contaminated by chemicals after many years of explosives production. The objective was to clear the site of contaminated buildings that presented a hazard. Preliminary studies have given some indication of site contamination. Demolition work has had to take account of this and heritage considerations. Buildings assessed as having heritage value will be examined for their level of contamination. Some 200 buildings have been demolished, and more will be demolished in 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The extent of contamination of the ground is still not known but qualitative studies are under way. The Department said that studies so far indicate that the site does not present a danger externally and is unlikely to present a human or ecological health risk to its surroundings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . A proposed second stage of studies will investigate the drainage system and assess the extent of contamination of the rest of the site quantitatively to help in estimating the remediation cost. It is not yet possible to estimate this cost or when remediation will be complete. It seems, however, that remediation will be expensive and that it will be many years before a suitable future use for the site can be determined.</PARA>
<PARA>This is quite extraordinary. Not only does the government not know how much it is going to cost to fix up this contaminated site, but it also does not know how long it is going to take and what the ultimate outcome of those attempts to fix up the site will be. The fact that it could cost more than the estimated value of $230 million is quite extraordinary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also extraordinary to note that early in 1993 the audit office made a preliminary study of the procedures of the Department of Defence associated with the closure of the explosives factory in Maribyrnong in Melbourne. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Explosives had been manufactured at the site since 1912 but by 1989 the facilities were regarded as out of date and too close to residential areas. Production capability was moved to facilities at Salisbury and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Two issues arose during the preliminary study. One was the expenditure of some $26m on facilities to produce nitroester and rocket motor propellants that has provided little value. The other was the delay in action to clear and decontaminate the factory site.</PARA>
<PARA>This production of nitroester was an extraordinary waste of money. The Auditor-General's report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  Plant to produce nitroester was ordered in 1987. (Nitroester is used in the production of rocket propellants, Otto fuel for torpedoes, etc.) In February 1989 the then Minister for Defence announced that the factory would close before December 1990 and that the buildings would be demolished. After the Minister's announcement the Department continued with the acquisition of the nitroester plant, which was delivered in May 1989 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that the decision was made in February 1989 to close the factory but the department went on with the delivery of the nitroester plant in May 1989 and installed it not in the new facility at Salisbury but in the old factory at Maribyrnong that was going to be closed down. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . After operating the plant for only three months, the Department transferred it in February 1991 to Salisbury where it was operated for only six months (September 1991-March 1992). The plant has since been scrapped. The cost of the purchase, installation and transfer of the plant was $5.2m.</PARA>
<PARA>That was absolutely and totally wasted. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The Salisbury facility was established to accommodate the Nulka Project, which had been developed at the Maribyrnong factory. (Nulka is a naval rocket-powered hovering decoy.) Between 1987 and 1992 the Department outlaid $22.3m through the Maribyrnong factory to establish the Salisbury facility. Of this amount some $10.8 million was spent from 1987 to 1990 on cast composite rocket propellant facilities for the Nulka Project and $11.5m was spent from 1990 to 1992 to establish a cast double base propellant facility for rocket motors in Ikara and Seacat missiles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . It was announced in mid-1992 that the Salisbury facility would be closed. There was no demand for the rocket motors. Although the Navy decided in March 1991 to stop using Ikara missiles, the Department continued to transfer rocket production facilities to Salisbury. Interest in Nulka declined; the Department will relocate the Nulka capability to Mulwala at further cost.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General says that it seemed to the ANAO:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the expenditure on plant to produce nitroester and facilities to produce rocket propellants provided little value to the Commonwealth and could have been avoided, at least partly, with forethought and better planning and coordination . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The Department said that in hindsight it might be seen as unnecessary to have purchased and installed the nitroester plant.</PARA>
<PARA>The department responded to the Auditor-General and has stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decisions taken by Defence in relation to establishing production facilities for nitroester and rocket motor propellants were based on the best information available at the time. Subsequent changes in operational requirements which resulted in the withdrawal from service of the Ikara and Seacat weapons systems significantly reduced the need for the facilities but it was not possible to foresee this at the time of the original decisions. Nor was it practicable to alter the course of action in progress to establish facilities at the stage the change in operational requirements became known.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that that looks quite extraordinary. It seems to me that the Auditor-General has uncovered once again in his particularly useful way some curious decisions within the bureaucratic structure. I commend him for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are just a couple of other remarks I would like to make briefly about the Auditor-General's report. One of them relates to the Australian Pork Corporation. I give notice that I will be paying more attention to this matter at an appropriate time. The Auditor-General's report on the audit of the accounts and records of the corporation referred to the fact that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . During the year the corporation incurred approximately $40 000 for legal costs in relation to the industry's appeal to the Federal Court in respect to findings regarding imports of Canadian pigmeat. Of this expense, an amount of almost $28 000 was in breach of the Pig Industry Act as it was a variance from the expenses included in the annual operational plan approved by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The Corporation has since been advised by the Minister that he is unable to sanction the Corporation funding the Federal Court action. The Corporation is continuing to seek Ministerial approval for the expense.</PARA>
<PARA>I must say that I hope, if that requires a cabinet decision, that a declaration of interest will be made on the matter by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter I would like to raise relates to the audit of the Australian Taxation Office, which I would like to deal with at length at another time. I want to mention in passing that it is curious to note that one of the matters that the audit office found to be unsatisfactory was the use by members of the tax office of the Australian Government credit card. The Auditor-General has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was a number of unsatisfactory matters relating to credit cards including:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">inadequate descriptions on sales vouchers which prevented verification of items purchased and no supporting documentation that goods and services had been received; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">monthly reconciliations of the credit card settlement account which were not always completed. </PARA>
<PARA>There may be some taxpayers who would be very interested to know that in its own administration the tax office, which takes such a strong position on the verification of credit card accounts that it will not regard monthly credit card statements as evidence of expenditure and requires the little yellow slips, has not satisfied the Auditor-General in respect of descriptions on sale vouchers and unsatisfactory reconciliation of the credit card settlement account. This is perhaps a whimsy that might appeal to those taxpayers who have found their deductions denied simply because they provided credit card monthly statements. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 330, Review of Auditor-General's Reports, May 1991&mdash;September 1992</EMPHASIS> details the Committee's review of 72 audit reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review was conducted in accordance with the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, which requires the Committee to examine all reports of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as representing the fulfilment of a statutory obligation, the review on which this report is based has given the Committee an opportunity to re-visit a series of audits which had been conducted some years ago. With the perspective of time, the Committee has been able to identify issues which have not, in the intervening years, been properly addressed by the audited agency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has not canvassed in detail all of the issues raised in the audit reports: to have done so would have gone over ground already well covered by the Auditor-General, and would have delayed considerably the tabling of this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead, the Committee has focused on the recommendations contained in the audit reports. We have surveyed and checked the responses given by each of the audited agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the vast majority of cases the audited agencies have agreed with the recommendations contained in the audit reports, and have taken appropriate, timely and effective remedial action. In these cases the Committee has made no comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has commented only in those cases where the agency response has been inappropriate, tardy or ineffective. Most of the recommendations therefore are aimed at encouraging agencies to complete actions taken in response to a particular audit report. However, I wish to draw attention to two recommendations which have wider implications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first concerns internal audit. The Auditor-General had recommended that the Department of Finance should develop better in-house knowledge and expertise in the area of internal audit so that it could help to improve standards in public sector internal auditing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Finance disagrees, maintaining that, in a devolved environment, it is inappropriate for it to have a broad role in assisting agencies to develop expertise in internal audit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee supports the view expressed by the Auditor-General and has recommended that the Department of Finance take a broader and more active role in improving internal audit standards in Commonwealth agencies. The Committee believes this role fits squarely with Finance's policy and program responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second recommendation I wish to draw attention to, concerns the mandate of the Auditor-General. The Committee notes that the Auditor-General has for some time sought to have himself appointed as the auditor for ANUTECH, a wholly owned subsidiary company of the ANU.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is consistent with recommendations contained in the Committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 296, The Auditor-General: Ally of the People and Parliament,</EMPHASIS> which called for the Auditor-General to be the auditor for all statutory authorities, government owned companies and government business enterprises. Moreover, in December 1990, the Government announced its agreement to this principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee endorses the Auditor-General's view that full public accountability to the Parliament of ANUTECH is not assured under the current auditing arrangements. Accordingly, we have recommended that the Auditor-General be appointed as ANUTECH's auditor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 330</EMPHASIS> is necessarily brief in the consideration it gives to the audit reports, the process of checking agency responses has been valuable in itself. Many agencies have been required to report to the Committee, in some cases more than once, on their progress in implementing the Auditor-General's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee regards its review of reports of the Auditor-General as an important part of its work and intends to table the results of its examinations on a regular basis. On occasions this will result in compilation reports, like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 330</EMPHASIS>, but on other occasions the Committee will review and report on individual audit reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this statutory review process, the House of Representatives has, over the last decade, developed the practice of referring some audit reports to its standing committees and to certain joint committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acknowledges that the referral of some audit reports to other committees is appropriate in some circumstances&mdash;for example, where an audit report is relevant to a subject already being considered by another committee, or where an audit report deals with an issue in which another committee has developed a particular expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the requirement to review described in the Public Accounts Committee Act is not satisfied by the referral of an audit report to another committee. It is the Committee's intention to examine all reports by the Auditor-General which are tabled in the Parliament. Although the Committee is conscious of the need to avoid unnecessary duplication, it will examine audit reports which have been referred to other committees. It is anticipated that, at times, this examination will show that another committee has reviewed or is reviewing the major issues identified in the audit report. At other times, the Committee may decide that further review is needed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reports of the Auditor-General make an essential contribution to parliamentary and public scrutiny of the Executive. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 330</EMPHASIS> will remind agencies that the process of scrutiny continues beyond the tabling of an audit report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As honourable senators would be aware, there has been some heated debate recently about the need to strengthen the mandate of the Auditor-General and take steps to ensure his independence from the Executive. I welcome this debate and remind the Senate that these issues have been of interest to the JCPA. Indeed they were at the heart of the Committee's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 296</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled in March 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge the Government to take advantage of the present opportunity to incorporate in its proposed financial management and audit legislation those recommendations from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 296</EMPHASIS> which it had previously rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On behalf of the Committee, I would like to thank the secretariat for their work on the review. I would also like to acknowledge the contribution made by other officers from the House of Representatives who helped in the initial analysis of the 72 audit reports reviewed in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report 330</EMPHASIS>. Finally, I acknowledge the Australian National Audit Office for their assistance during this review, and, of course, without whom this review would not be possible.</PARA>

HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Cerberus</EMPHASIS> is the major training establishment for the Royal Australian Navy and is located on Western Port Bay, Victoria, some 60 kilometres south-east of Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1991 Defence Force structure review endorsed by the Commonwealth government foreshadowed the closure and transfer of the technical training establishment at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> west of Sydney. At the invitation of the Hon. L. Lieberman MP, member for Indi, the committee inspected the army college of TAFE at Bonegilla, which was one of the alternative locations considered for training by the Department of Defence. Although impressed by the facilities at Bonegilla, the committee concurs with the decision made by the Department of Defence, following a survey conducted for them by Kinhill Engineers, to transfer technical training to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transfer of technical training from HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba</EMPHASIS> to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> necessitates the provision of additional facilities to enable effective training to continue. Existing facilities and services at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> date back to the early 1920s. However, a number of facilities are more modern or have been upgraded. This proposal provides for technical training facilities, replacement of those facilities where upgrading is not economical, expansion of facilities unable to cope with increased demand and new facilities for services operating from temporary and inadequate accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scope of the work provides for continuous functioning of the base throughout the construction period and includes a health centre, technical training classrooms and workshops, indoor swimming pool, gymnasium extension, motor transport compound and engineering services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee viewed the medical and dental services which are presently provided from 18 separate buildings. The majority of these buildings are being utilised for functions for which they were neither originally designed nor adequately constructed. The committee agrees with a comment made by the Minister for Defence, the Hon. Senator Robert Ray, when, at a Senate estimates committee hearing in September 1991, he described the facility as the `most disgraceful Defence facility I have seen in Australia'. The committee commends the personnel at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> for working under such conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of waste water management was raised by the committee at the public hearing, and the Department of Defence gave the committee a verbal undertaking to carry out a study of the potential for the re-use of waste water at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS>. That has been the attitude of the committee on a number of issues. The committee, therefore, recommended in its report that such a survey be carried out. However, last Friday the committee received a report on recycling of second class water, which has been carried out by Kinhill Engineers for the Department of Defence. This report concluded that the cost of developing and operating recycled water irrigation systems is high, and the implementation of such schemes will not result in an overall cost saving through the reduction of relatively small volumes of first class water. The committee commends the Department of Defence for speedily taking action on its recommendation and assures it that the committee will study the report in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee commends the Department of Defence on the regular energy audits of its establishments and recommends that it be advised on the implementation of the recommendations of the energy audit recently conducted at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS>. The estimated cost of the technical training and other facilities at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> is $45.5 million at April 1993 prices.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We return to the debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill, which is essentially a machinery bill and which allows a couple of alterations, keeping in mind the government's nomination of a particular person, namely, Justice Deirdre O'Connor to be appointed as President of the Industrial Relations Commission. This legislation is particularly related to that appointment. As such, it allows a current judge of a court created by parliament to be president, and not, as the legislation presently allows, just a person who has previously been a judge. It ensures that a judge's salary and conditions are not reduced or affected by such an appointment as president. The legislation allows the first president, Deirdre O'Connor, to be appointed after its passage. It allows that first president to be appointed for just five years, with subsequent appointments to age 65 as before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter of a five-year appointment would normally be of considerable concern because it raises the potential for governments to undermine the president's independence and thereby the independence of the Industrial Relations Commission itself. I say that it would normally be of great concern, but that concern is alleviated entirely by the fact that it will be applicable to the first president to be appointed and therefore it does not establish a precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber we can establish laws to change legislation for each particular case. That does not establish a precedent; it allows individual cases to be considered on their merit. If a future change was to be made&mdash;as has been suggested by some critics of this legislation&mdash;it would occur not as a result of a precedent but after a full deliberation in this place. Full parliamentary scrutiny is what is required for the amendment of any legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore it does not create a precedent; it creates a particular application. We still have the opportunity to judge legislation on its merits. The Australian Democrats have no difficulty with this particular legislation. The government's professed aim is to make senior appointments from outside what is known as the industrial relations club and we welcome that move. Regardless of which interest group in society the appointee comes from, in a body such as the Industrial Relations Commission all new appointees will need to work extremely hard to gain the confidence not only of their colleagues but also of those on whose behalf they are passing judgment. That would apply no matter who was appointed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason to doubt that Justice O'Connor will rise to the occasion&mdash;as she has done in other appointments, such as on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Her track record demonstrates she has a capacity for intelligence and energy, and independence. An independent point of view is the most important characteristic here, and that has been displayed in former appointments. They are the sorts of qualities that the President of the Industrial Relations Commission will need to display. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just say in passing that Mr Iain Ross will be a fine addition to the commission because he brings with him, as a vice-president of part of the Industrial Relations Commission, particular expertise in the area for which he will be responsible.

The cries seem orchestrated and poetic; they are contrived and have virtually been rehearsed to the point of being refined and almost predictable. We have seen such orchestrations before. Those who have argued against the appointments to such senior posts usually have fallen flat on their faces because the capacity of the appointees has been demonstrated to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is proposing an amendment to the second reading.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My first reaction to the claim that senior commission posts have been stacked with union officials is that it is misleading to attach such weight to the origins of commission members. Once people are appointed to the commission they tend to be influenced more by their obligation to serve the public interest than by their past allegiances. For instance, I am quite certain that Mr Iain Ross will act with the intelligence and impartiality that is required in his new post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that the reverse allegation was made not so long ago by Mr Bill Kelty of the ACTU.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did I hear somebody talking about balance? The Democrats do not dispute that the commission needs to be broadly represented. I would even use the word `balanced', now that it has been introduced into the argument. But it does not refer only to former employer representatives or former employee representatives, but also, for example, to gender balance. Taking into account all the considerations, the appointments that have been made by Minister Brereton are a step in the right direction. The proof of the pudding will be in the eating. To make assertions and assumptions now is not only naive but, I suggest, ignores the precedents of decisions that have been made by the commission&mdash;and the criticisms of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What matters ultimately is not the make-up of the commission but the decisions. The time to criticise will be when the decisions are before us.

We expect the new commission to bring the same wisdom and independence to bear in the ground-breaking work before it. We oppose the amendment to the second reading; and we support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 and support the remarks of my colleague Senator Chapman and the amendment that he has moved. This bill makes provision for the appointment of a judge as President of the Industrial Relations Commission. Justice Deirdre O'Connor has had a distinguished career. At present she is a judge in the Federal Court and President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. She was also chair of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for a time. However, there is nothing in her record to suggest that she has had any significant experience in the complex and difficult area of industrial relations. Honourable senators may be aware that the Industrial Relations Act specifically indicates that the appointee to the position of president should have `skills and experience in the field of industrial relations'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I can ascertain, Justice Deirdre O'Connor's experience in the area of industrial relations is extremely limited. It is confined essentially to workers' compensation where the issues involved inevitably do not deal with the collective relations between employers and employees. It is a measure of the arrogance of this government that whereas we are passing this legislation through the parliament purely to assist the appointment of Justice O'Connor, the government is unwilling to acknowledge in this bill that by the standards of the current act&mdash;its own act which it has previously passed through this parliament&mdash;it appears that Justice O'Connor is not qualified for this task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably the Governor-General is going to be advised that Justice Deirdre O'Connor has a high level of experience in industrial relations. The government will have to advise him that. The government should change the act to allow the appointment of someone like Justice O'Connor, without the necessary experience&mdash;if that is the way the government wishes to go&mdash;or the Governor-General should press the executive council for further information on her industrial relations experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a debating point. By not amending the legislation this way the government exposes Justice O'Connor to being disqualified from office at a future date, possibly by the High Court. One can easily contemplate that in a bitter industrial relations dispute where emotions are running very high a declaration could be sought by parties to this dispute, who may believe they will be in receipt of an unfavourable determination, claiming to the High Court that Justice Deirdre O'Connor has not been properly appointed. I also draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the announcement of the appointment has been made before the legislation is through the parliament and before the Governor-General has had a chance to consider the recommendation of the government. This is but another example of an arrogant break with tradition, when the Governor-General announces the appointments of high government office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are strong reasons for this protocol, not the least being that the appointees are seen to be independent. There are a number of people on the Federal Court who have a more detailed understanding and, hence, a far greater claim to this position than Justice O'Connor would appear to have. Such people include Justice Keely, Justice Gray, Justice Ryan or Justice Northrop. Possibly they were approached by Minister Brereton&mdash;I do not know. However, it has to be said that there was no press speculation encouraged by the minister's office about possible offers to these and other distinguished judges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In industrial relations circles there is widespread criticism of the government for its failure to consult about this appointment. I am sorry that this point was not picked up by Senator Bell in his remarks. The last three presidents of the commission&mdash;Sir Richard Kirby, Sir John Moore and Barry Maddern&mdash;had a wealth of experience to bring to the institution. Maddern struggled hard and manfully to maintain the independence of the institution but, as we all know, he was treated shabbily by Mr Kelty and the government for his efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice O'Connor&mdash;I heard Senator Bell's remarks and the hopes that he expressed&mdash;may turn out to be a great president of the commission. I wish her well. But I would be less than frank if I did not state that at present, based on her level of experience, she is clearly the odd president out&mdash;and I am referring to the other three presidents. There is an argument put to me by people involved in this area that industrial relations is a jurisdiction where subtlety and a deep knowledge of industrial relations history is important in the often highly charged atmosphere in which cases are heard. I certainly hope that Justice O'Connor has these skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All previous appointments saw the post of President of the Industrial Relations Commission as the pinnacle of their careers. This bill makes it a comparatively short-term assignment. Justice O'Connor has been appointed for a fixed period only. Why? The presidency of the commission is not a life sentence. Justice O'Connor could leave at any time&mdash;in two, five or 10 years. The government has not explained why  it is necessary to create this special arrangement. Senator Faulkner is smiling. I am interested to hear his remarks. Perhaps he could answer the question about the five-year term and what is so special about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is usual with this government, there was no consultation with employers prior to the announcement. I am sorry that Senator Bell did not make that comment. It is important in this area that the commission enjoys the confidence of all parties. When employers and their views are not only ignored, which is bad enough, but are not even given the courtesy of an opportunity to consult with the government, it is a very poor start indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Justice O'Connor will have a mighty task to convince employers in this country that the court will provide industrial relations justice without fear or favour. The plain fact of the matter&mdash;I again listened very carefully to Senator Bell's comments&mdash;is that the presidential members of the commission have been stacked with ACTU operatives: Jan Marsh, Alan Boulton, Ian Watson and Jenny Acton are already presidential members; Iain Ross, as has been mentioned, has just been appointed. All these individuals come directly from the office of Bill Kelty. If it is not so important whether these people have a union background or an employer's background, why are all these major appointments coming straight out of the ACTU? Frankly, the government and the unions feel it is important and we in this Senate should express concern about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, with your interest in industrial relations you will remember that Jenny Acton got her position by deciding not to contest the ALP preselection for the seat of Hotham. Honourable senators will recall that that seat was given to Simon Crean. What a small world it is. Of course, that is not to say that these appointees are precluded from carrying out their tasks in a thoroughly professional fashion. I understand that Alan Boulton, for example, has established a reputation for impartiality and is eminently well qualified for the position he currently holds. I point out to Senator Bell that I am not opposed to the appointment of union people, but we need union people of quality and union people who are prepared to establish their independence. Even Phil Gude, the Victorian industrial relations minister, observed that Boulton had served as President of the Victorian Industrial Relations Commission with integrity and professionalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the standards of the Labor cronies act&mdash;the overriding law which governs the activities of the Keating administration&mdash;it has to be said that Iain Ross, the new vice-president in charge of enterprise agreements, is superbly qualified, having worked with both Mr Keating and Mr Kelty. He has the double. Indeed, a number of commentators consider the vice-presidential role to be more powerful and influential in the commission than even the presidential position, to which Justice O'Connor has been appointed. The result of the government's legislation in this area is to force work into the bargaining division, which Iain Ross, late of the ACTU, controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AIRC should not be in a position, as the ACTU is, where the secretary makes the running and the president is the mouthpiece. Justice O'Connor has the ultimate responsibility  for the commission, but she will have no direct control over one of the key areas. Hence, this vice-presidential appointment greatly adds to the problems that Justice O'Connor now has in restoring the credibility of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are approximately 17 presidential members of the commission in all. I point out to Senator Bell that only two members come from business backgrounds and two from government backgrounds. As I have said, the preponderance of federal government appointees to the commission comes from trade union backgrounds. Senator Bell&mdash;given his often expressed concern for small business, which I do not dispute&mdash;would have served the community better if he had drawn the attention of his particular concern to this stacking of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under previous administrations, Liberal and Labor, there was a genuine attempt to establish a balanced commission that could attract widespread support from the community and, indeed, all sides of politics. Under the Hawke and Keating governments, this tradition has been cast aside. The commission, through appointments and the Industrial Relations Reform Act, has in effect been converted to an arm of government and of the ACTU in an attempt to make it do Keating and Kelty's bidding. I therefore stress that Justice O'Connor and her other commission members have a truly mighty task to demonstrate independence from the government and the ACTU. Their efforts will be closely watched by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, neither business nor the states were consulted in this appointment. The changes to industrial relations make it essential that the states be consulted on appointments. There is no doubt that the commission's role has been greatly strengthened by the recent change to the Industrial Relations Act, giving the commission power to set minimum terms and conditions of employment for all Australian workers, not just those covered by federal awards. There will be increasing importance attached to test cases run in the commission on such matters as parental leave, termination and redundancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Justice Boulton, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Journal of Labor Law</EMPHASIS>, argues that there has been widespread acceptance of the need for cooperation and coordination between different industrial relations systems. The Commonwealth, as the dominant player, must exercise considerable care and restraint in making further changes to the system and in making appointments to the commission. In this context, the failure to consult with the states prior to making a present appointment is not a welcome development. If the Commonwealth wishes to establish its bona fides in relation to a more coordinated and cooperative national set of arrangements governing industrial relations, it must take the initiative in promoting greater trust and confidence in those parts of the national system over which it has exclusive control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also needs to be remembered that this government and the present ACTU leadership have done more to damage the standing and reputation of the AIRC than any other government in our history. Honourable senators will recall the Staples affair, the controversy over commission pay, a tax on the commission by Keating and Kelty after the 1991 national wage case, and the stacking of trade union people onto the commission. And who could forget the resignation of the former trade union leader and commissioner, Ken Turbet, who said that he had had a gutful of government and ACTU attacks on the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that in the not too distant future Justice O'Connor will have the opportunity to demonstrate that the commission over which she now presides is one that will maintain its independence and integrity and will judge cases on their merits and not simply endorse government-ACTU proposals. She would do a great deal to restore confidence in the commission if she gave a clear message to the government that what she wanted was a balanced and independent commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government changes to the AIRC are an attempt to bend this institution to union and government dictates. The government, forever proving that it is the industrial arm of the trade union movement, has met all of Kelty's demands over the last decade or so to extend union power and privilege within the Australian community. Just think of the list: compulsory amalgamations; compulsory superannuation; overriding state government laws through the aggressive use of ILO conventions; huge amounts of government grants to trade unions; and of course a vast range of jobs in strategic positions being given to union representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the AIRC, the government has been more than happy to follow Mr Kelty's bidding. Yet the paradox remains: every effort to buttress the power and privilege of unions only seems to make them feel more insecure. I point out to Labor senators that the ultimate security of the union movement lies not within the laws which this parliament or any other parliament may pass; nor does it lie in the ability of Bill Kelty to stack key institutions. The security of the union movement lies in the hearts and minds of Australians. And the plain fact of the matter is that increasing numbers of Australians are refusing to join trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a decade in power, all the ALP-ACTU government has delivered is massive unemployment. Of course, having prevented major reforms to the economy, Kelty and Keating have left Australian workers exposed to further economic adversity. Kelty has treated other players&mdash;key institutions and state governments&mdash;with contempt. I wonder whether he is worried that other governments in other times may make use of the precedence that he has established. Mr Kelty's attitude reminds me of the East Germans: they constructed the Berlin Wall and for decades worked hard to make it more secure and more impregnable; yet in 1989 the whole structure came tumbling down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1994 the attitudes of Mr Kelty seem more and more irrelevant. If the AIRC as it is presently constructed turns out to be simply another arm of the Kelty machine and the government, we can be assured that public support and respect, which are essential to any key institution, will collapse. Justice O'Connor and her colleagues must now establish their independence. If they do not, I make this prediction: this parliament will be debating industrial relations reform bills relating to the AIRC in the years to come. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make this afternoon is that, even though this is just a minor machinery bill to amend the substantive bill which went through the parliament in December, it does not encourage people to invest in Australia. In fact, it is another minor irritant on the investment scene here. I have said in the Senate several times that there is an investment crisis here right now. The level of investment in Australia for the last two years has been the lowest ever by business for over 30 years, and the investment in plant and equipment is the lowest ever since World War II&mdash;over 40 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What an extraordinary outburst! If we want to encourage people to invest, what do we do&mdash;go around threatening people? Investment is a voluntary act by individuals or by companies, partnerships or various other business entities who make decisions based on their perceptions of the opportunities for making a profit from investments. After all, I remind the government that in the last several years most of the growth in business has been in very small business, which we expect will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who are looking to invest&mdash;and they are looking to invest&mdash;have a choice of whether they invest here or overseas. Basically, the government has been frightening those people and consequently encouraging them to invest overseas rather than here. Instead of trying to blame business for the lack of investment, the government should be looking in a mirror. After all, it was the government which accelerated interest rates here and led us into the recession we had to have. We had interest rates much higher than we needed and we had a recession which was longer and deeper than we needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as importantly, the industrial relations bill that went through the parliament in December was also an absolute positive deterrent to investment because it increased the uncertainty of the business world&mdash;of investors&mdash;about their people. With this bill, the government is signalling further ACTU involvement in the industrial relations scene and, again, the perception will be that the government does not want us to invest in Australia. Yet it is known by all advisers and commentators in the investment world that freeing up the labour market and not constraining it is the first priority for sustained economic growth in the long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to close now, Mr Acting Deputy President, by making sure the Senate understands that the threatening rhetoric we have been hearing from the government in recent months in an attempt to encourage investment has actually heightened concerns about investment and frightened people away from investing in Australia.

The infrastructure for the administration scheme is already in place and will not require major enhancement to deal with an expected gradual increase in workload. It may be necessary to transfer some resources from the DVA to Defence as the number of beneficiaries under each scheme changes. There will be a decline in the overall workload of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. There is already a system in place in Defence for safety, rehabilitation and compensation and this system will result in administrative savings. Overall there will be minimal augmentation which will generally result in savings that are difficult to quantify precisely.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that there is very little rehabilitation at the moment under the old VEA legislation, except in some limited cases for Vietnam veterans. But, under the new provisions of the MCS, much greater consideration is given to rehabilitation. Defence will integrate its administration of the scheme and ensure that it fulfils its responsibilities in the way that employers in other industries are increasingly doing in the rehabilitation area. It is generally no longer acceptable for employers, where they have been found to have injured an employee, not to take an interest in the rehabilitation of the injured individual.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A separate MCS, which is administered by Defence, brings that employer's responsibility into sharper focus. The responsibility for occupational health and safety, compensation and rehabilitation are all closely aligned. The MCS will allow Defence to integrate all of the aspects of this important area. Although the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a long history of administering veterans' benefits, it has had little experience in managing the type of rehabilitation and vocational retraining that is the hallmark of modern compensation legislation, such as the MCS. Defence is now fulfilling its rehabilitation and vocational training responsibilities under the SRCA and is well positioned to continue this for the MCS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much rehabilitation work is now carried out by the Defence Force's medical services and through a highly effective system of schools and training courses. The MCS allows the co-location of medical, occupational health and safety, compensation, rehabilitation and defence administration in the regional defence centres. This arrangement will help to ensure that an injured serviceman or servicewoman is provided with continuous support for a process of treatment and rehabilitation both within and without the service. It is important to keep the MCS separate from the VEA. Although both schemes provide excellent benefits, they are different schemes with a different focus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that the parliamentary secretary's advisers would have those figures to hand, because it is a very relevant question. The government is asking us to approve a bill that provides for a lump sum payment. We have established what that lump sum payment is. By the standards of the time, with respect to all the circumstances under which a claim might be made, I would have thought that that sum was considerably inadequate. I would have thought the other thing the parliamentary secretary would have is a case history experience. The MCS is based on a bill which has been running for six years. It is important for the parliament to be able to judge whether the provision of a lump sum in the case of major injury is attainable for someone, if that person is badly injured.</PARA></TALK.START>

If we consider the potential lump sum payment together with the possible pension entitlements and the increased emphasis in this legislation on ensuring rehabilitation of the servicewoman or serviceman involved through education, training and a range of other initiatives, I do not think that package is unreasonable.</PARA></TALK.START>

He is 22 years of age. Under the MCS he is on peacetime service. He will qualify for the lump sum payment. He will qualify for income support&mdash;presumably at the level of a private. What happens to that soldier when he reaches 65 years of age? At present he is covered under the VEA. He would be on a maximum rate TPI pension under the current VEA legislation which would not cut out at 65 years of age; it would see him through for the term of his natural life.

At 65 years of age, that person would be receiving a service person's superannuation entitlement, which is 76.5 per cent of that person's salary. Obviously the amount depends on the salary that person is receiving.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the greatest respect, I think it is relevant. A major area of responsibility was removed from the Department of Veterans' Affairs by this government when it decided to get out of providing hospital care and either integrated within the state system or sold off the repatriation general hospitals. That takes a great deal of responsibility away from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. If we now move the responsibility for compensation and other entitlements away from the Department of Veterans' Affairs and transfer it, as will occur under this Military Compensation Act which will apply to all members of the ADF and certainly all peacetime members, these personnel will not have the right of a claim under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The government will then find that a great part of the responsibilities and duties of the Department of Veterans' Affairs will disappear. I am asking Senator Sherry quite directly: how long will this government keep the Department of Veterans' Affairs in existence?</PARA></TALK.START>

As he will have gathered from my questioning, I have a great concern about the position of veterans under this legislation when they reach 65 years of age.

The commission supervises the administration of both the SRCA and the occupational health and safety legislation. An essential feature of the composition of the commission, after extensive consultations flowing from the Brown review of the Comcare program, was that it should represent employers, unions and government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will be supporting the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill. It is very short; basically, it will facilitate the commission of inquiry that has been set up to inquire into ASIS. It will do so by ensuring that the inquiry has access to the information that is necessary to it. There being some doubt about that under the terms of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act, this amendment will ensure that such access can be provided. Therefore, we obviously support the spirit of what we find in this bill because we support the notion of the inquiry that the government has finally conceded to conduct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, aspects of this inquiry still concern us. I wish to take a minute of the Senate's time to mention some of those concerns because while they remain outstanding we fear that they will prejudice the final determinations of the inquiry. That is something we obviously do not wish to occur. Concern has been expressed&mdash;in particular, by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, Mr Peacock, who has opposition responsibility in this area&mdash;about the appointment of Mr Michael Codd and Mr Chris Maxwell in their respective positions under this inquiry. We do not question their capability or integrity but we do question whether their appointment was appropriate in light of their previous relationships. I mention in particular Mr Codd's functions in the area of intelligence and security services&mdash;he presided over the secretary's committee on intelligence and security and the Office of Security Intelligence Coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern, therefore, is that he is too close in his background. It would be better to have appointed someone to this task who can be seen publicly to be more at arms length from the issues that are being addressed by the commission. I stress that it is no criticism of Mr Codd's capacity or his integrity. If the findings of this commission are going to be accorded the sort of public support that we would like to see, it would have been more sensible for the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to have kept the commission more at arms length from what it is charged to examine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Maxwell concerns us because he was so close to Senator Evans; he worked in his office when Senator Evans was Attorney-General. It is bad judgment by Senator Evans. We regret that it has occurred. We have invited him to address it, but he has declined to do so. I guess that is not surprising, because that is the way that Senator Evans normally approaches these matters. But it will be seen to be a shortcoming of the process that is the subject matter of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have criticised&mdash;and I do again&mdash;the terms of reference of the inquiry, which seem to us to be too vague and narrow. The functional role and priorities of ASIS have been excluded. The inquiry is really only looking into how ASIS was run and not what it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I remind you that the night before Senator Evans announced this inquiry he was assuring us that what he had in mind was a `root and branch inquiry' into ASIS. He told us that one of the motivating factors was that the Cold War was over and that we must re-examine ASIS in light of the new strategic environment. That can only be interpreted in one way: there is a need to examine the functions and priorities of ASIS in the new strategic environment. Yet by the following day he told us that that was unnecessary and that he did not intend to give the inquiry the breadth to examine such a fundamental question. We believe that that is a major shortcoming of this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly do not accept the justification that Senator Evans gave for the revision of his thinking, which is that an internal inquiry had already taken place within the last few years. From memory, I think it occurred in 1992. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will remember, from the little you would have seen about it in the press, that it was purely an internal review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that it is necessary to now look beyond the views of the Canberra bureaucracy. Therefore, what logically follows is that the minister has given us no justifiable explanation for his overnight change of mind. One can only assume that pressure was put on him from some direction; one knows not what. The legacy will be that this inquiry will take place and will be concluded without there being any outside examination of the objects and priorities of ASIS in this new strategic environment. That is a disappointing shortcoming. An opportunity has been lost by this government, and no satisfactory explanation has been given for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that some of the allegations that were made were operational allegations. It is hard to imagine how they can be examined without looking at the functional role and priorities of the body itself. We are also concerned about the threats that appeared in Senator Evans's press statement in relation to the ASIS officers whose public concern has led to this inquiry&mdash;a public concern that they voiced under very difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. On the one hand, the government cannot criticise them for voicing their concerns about an important, secret and, therefore, protected body within our bureaucracy and, on the other hand, acknowledge that there is sufficient justification arising out of their concerns to set up a commission of inquiry of this nature. If Senator Evans accepts that there is sufficient justification to set it up, then we believe that to finish his press release with threats to the individuals concerned is unsound, unhelpful and does not demonstrate from the minister the sort of good faith that we have a right to expect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security validated at least some of the expressions of concern of these officers who made complaints when he found, in relation to issues concerning their labour relations, that they had been handled `improperly'&mdash;I think that was the word he used in one of his annual reports. Certainly, he said that they had been denied natural justice. In those circumstances where the Inspector-General gives credit to aspects of their complaint, their personal grievances, one wonders whether there might be some validity to the claims that they make on operational matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess that is one of our fundamental concerns that we are pleased has resulted in an inquiry of this type. The fact that they have received some support from the Inspector-General into certain aspects of their complaints at least gives them sufficient basis to justify an inquiry into those which are much more difficult to explore: the operational questions. It also indicates that the people making complaints deserve to be treated with more respect in their expressions of concern than what they have received from Senator Evans to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How these particular former ASIS officers are supported in this inquiry will, again, demonstrate how serious the government is in fairly addressing their concerns. The question of legal assistance is one that is still on the table. I will be interested to hear what support the government is prepared to give them to ensure that their case is put to this inquiry in a proper and professional way; certainly in a way that is at least as professional as that which is going to be put by others denying their claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is critical now that the government has gone down this path that it gets to the bottom of these very serious allegations so the public can be reassured in the future that ASIS conducts its business in a way that the public has a right to expect. I understand that the inquiry will look at the operation of ASIS within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and into the well-known public antagonism against ASIS that exists within parts of the foreign affairs bureaucracy. Without a sound working relationship between the two bodies under the same umbrella, the public obviously will suffer a loss of confidence and there will be a loss of efficiency. If, as I understand it, the inquiry is going to look at that issue, we will be pleased to see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the case obviously was made out for an inquiry. We are pleased that it is occurring. We are very sceptical about Senator Evans's explanation that he had been giving this inquiry consideration for some time, firstly because he told us the same day as he said he was considering it that there was no need. Between question time during the day and estimates in the evening he apparently changed his mind. Secondly, he said that he had been considering it for some time and it needed to be root and branch, thus obviously raising the issue of objects and priorities. Yet the following day he decided that that was not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such confusion does not give us confidence that it had been well thought through by Senator Evans, but rather that he had been induced to go down this path by public embarrassment caused by the revelations made public by these officers. While not having great confidence in his planning for this process, we are nevertheless pleased that it is occurring. We wish only to record that we would have been happier if he had ensured that in the structure of both the commission and its counsel those with vested interests were to be kept more at arms length. We would also have been happier if he had gone as far as he indicated that he desired to go&mdash;and had a full inquiry, including an inquiry into the functions and objects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators on my side of the chamber have been supportive of ASIS over the years. But when bodies are protected by secrecy, as this one needs to be, it places upon the government perhaps a greater responsibility than in relation to other parts of the bureaucracy to ensure that the body keeps to its charge and its objects, to ensure that it is efficiently managed to achieve those objects and, particularly, to ensure that staff who have less recourse to public avenues of support than staff in other areas are properly treated and do not get into difficulties with ASIS, eventually being told by an adjudicator that they were denied the principles of natural justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As we have heard, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Amendment Bill 1994 relates to the impending commission of inquiry into the operation and management of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, ASIS. These amendments will enable the Inspector-General of ASIS and his staff, both current and former, to appear before the commission of inquiry and to give evidence, including documentation, something not currently permitted within the provisions of the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats agree that the commission of inquiry must have unimpeded access to all the necessary and relevant documentation as well as information from officers of ASIS without the risk of prosecution of those giving evidence at this inquiry. Under the circumstances, the Democrats are pleased to support these amendments as they will undoubtedly strengthen the inquiry's scope and enable the commission to examine ASIS operations in accordance with the government's terms of reference. As to those terms of reference, the Australian Democrats have a number of concerns which we have previously stated in relation to ASIS operations and about which we hope the commission of inquiry will deliver some positive recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should by now be no doubt that ASIS is, in all probability, an organisation operating out of control. The government's desire to have the commission of inquiry examine the current arrangements for the control and accountability of ASIS indicates that the government also has concerns. The recent ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program on ASIS revealed remarkably disturbing aspects of the operations of this country's foreign intelligence services. We believe a great many people who saw that program were as alarmed as we were at the allegations contained in the program and, in particular, at claims that Australia was involved in illegal activities in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth repeating here that we believe the whole question of why Australia is involved in the foreign intelligence business at all should come within the scope of this commission of inquiry. The Democrats do not accept that a middle-sized power such as Australia has any real reason to be involved in foreign intelligence, and we sincerely doubt that there is any lasting benefit to this country by indulging in this sort of activity. For instance, why on earth is ASIS involving itself in intelligence operations being conducted by both the British and the US in third countries? How do these sorts of operations bring any benefit to our foreign policy?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are concerned that the allegations surrounding ASIS will do substantial damage to Australia's reputation in the international community. Clearly, ASIS is an organisation which at the moment is accountable to no-one. The effectiveness and the value of Australia's foreign intelligence services are severely in question here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background, the issue of oversight of ASIS is perhaps the most important aspect of the examination to be conducted by the commission of inquiry, and the terms of inquiry reflect this. As I said at the time this issue arose, it is an essential cornerstone of democracy that no body or group can be or should be above the law. There is absolutely no justification whatsoever for any government instrumentality to effectively operate as a law unto itself, as ASIS now appears to be doing. We obviously cannot allow this to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ASIS is to continue then there must be serious thought given to control and accountability mechanisms now in place. Accordingly, the Democrats note and welcome the commission of inquiry terms of reference, which will include an examination of current control and accountability processes. We believe there needs to be better oversight of ASIS and its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time ago I asked the minister a series of questions about the accountability of ASIS and how similar foreign intelligence services, such as MI6 or the CIA, were monitored in the United Kingdom and in the United States. It is worth repeating that in those countries a process is in place whereby both intelligence agencies are scrutinised by their respective legislatures. In the UK, for instance, parliamentary oversight is now being put in place which will hold to account both the internal and the external intelligence agencies of that country. Perhaps we need to look at setting up a similar structure here. One option may be to expand the role and responsibility of the parliamentary committee currently overseeing the operations of ASIO so as to bring in ASIS as well. We will be awaiting with very keen interest the outcome of the commission's recommendations on this subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On another matter, the Democrats express some reservations that the commission's terms of reference are not sufficient to examine the grievance system now in place in ASIS. Quite clearly&mdash;the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> report underlined this point&mdash;the existing grievance system for staff appears to have failed. Serious allegations have been made and the Democrats are concerned at this stage that the commission of inquiry should be in a position to deliver some form of justice to those officers and ex-officers who have legitimate grievances against ASIS. In all of this, the Democrats believe it is important that former officers of ASIS not be forgotten. In spite of all this, and in many ways because of all this, the Democrats support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is finally dealing with the last of four omnibus tax bills or amendment law bills which were introduced into the parliament during 1993. I remind the Senate that there are in excess of 20 taxation proposals previously announced which the government has yet to legislate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Senate rises prior to the budget session the parliament will have before it another omnibus tax bill correcting further difficulties. This bill seeks to amend the already complex Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 and the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because time will not allow me to dwell on all the relative merits and drawbacks of each measure, I will be fairly selective in my remarks. I deal firstly with the fringe benefits tax. The general exemption to employees for travel in foreign locations rectifies a problem that should never have existed or been created in the first place. The change in the fringe benefits tax is that the rate applicable to many non-profit organisations will extend to non-government schools under Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment rectifies a deficiency in the original legislation which the explanatory memorandum says was unintentional. Luckily for those potential casualties of the government's attempt to legislate, this deficiency has now been picked up and the amendment is supported by the National Council of Independent Schools Associations and will extend the grossing up rebate to a number of schools in Tasmania, including the Hutchins School, St Michaels Collegiate School, the Launceston Church Grammar School and Scotch Oakburn College. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final FBT change is aimed, I guess, to increase tax revenue by eliminating the loophole that employers had found with the FBT on car parking provisions. I draw the Senate's attention to how quickly the government often moves to rectify measures if there is an intended loss to revenue. Presently, employers must pay FBT on car parking benefits, mind you, provided to their employees. Naturally, some astute employers have minimised the FBT payable by selecting low reference rates&mdash;the fees charged at kerbside meters or the night-time fees set by commercial parking stations. The effect of this amendment is that fringe benefits tax will be calculated in relation to daytime rates from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. only, and that parking meters will not be considered `commercial parking stations'. I remind the Senate that, in effect, each car parking space may attract a double tax, especially where more than one car uses that space in any particular day. I also remind the Senate of the very high compliance costs associated with identifying cars coming in and going out of car parking spaces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that light, I confidently predict that this amendment will not clarify the matter sufficiently. I forecast that problems will arise with the concept of `commercial parking rate' which could vary between locations. One way of eliminating this problem altogether would be to use a standard rate applicable to all employers, irrespective of location. If the Australian Taxation Office adopted a commonsense approach to interpreting the legislation as it currently stands, this amendment would not be necessary. However, instead, there have already been determinations as to the measurement of the one-kilometre radius, the form of valuation required, what is a commercial parking station, the valuation of car parking benefits and the valuation of benefits for a particular day&mdash;just to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, we find nine amendments for measures which will add something like 40 pages or more to already complex legislation. Taking this in the light of announcements made by the government over the past few years about simplification&mdash;15 February 1990, November 1992, 1 September 1993 and 17 December 1993&mdash;I am a little perplexed as to what the government's real intention is because quite often the complexity of taxation laws is increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment on the question of luxury cars will force those lessors of luxury cars who use the finance method of returning their assessable income to take account of the depreciation limits, thereby increasing their assessable income. The government estimates that approximately $60 million is at risk if this measure is not implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators of litigation involving Citibank on the issue of leasing arrangements. The finance method in that case was rejected and the taxpayer was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court on the decision of the Full Federal Court where that court held that Citibank was assessable on the gross rentals received under the finance leases of cars but was entitled to depreciation allowances, subject to section 57AF cost limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment in clause 51 aims to ensure that liability for franking additional tax is not affected where franking deficit tax can be offset by an initial payment of company tax. The proposed amendment will apply to overfranking of a dividend that is paid after 14 December 1993 when this bill was introduced into the House. In relation to overfranking of tax&mdash;I must say that I will not comment on an aspect in the original bill&mdash;I am pleased that the government does intend to raise an amendment to correct a problem in relation to dividends declared and paid that could have resulted in some unintentional tax paid by companies because of approximately a nine-day difference between the dates dividends have to be declared and actually paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Institute of Australia argues that, with changes to the corporate tax payment system whereby companies will pay 85 per cent of their prior year tax liability within 28 days of the end of the year, there should be no real concern in allowing companies to include the 85 per cent tax payment in their calculation of franking credits for the prior year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the heritage conservation rebate. This amendment will give a 20 per cent rebate for approved expenditure of at least $10,000 on conservation work on heritage listed buildings. Heritage conservation work is defined as work for the conservation, maintenance, preservation, restoration, reconstruction or adaptation of a building or other structure of cultural significance and is listed on a heritage register declared by the responsible minister as a recognised heritage register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a bureaucratic, essentially two-step process to be administered by the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services. I note that there is a $2 million cap per annum so it appears that, unless the government wishes to clarify my assumption, the rebate will be available on a first come, first served basis. The Taxation Institute of Australia and others have concerns about the rebate scheme. The institute states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the inclusion of a further Division, to provide a rebate, albeit for a commendable purpose merely adds further to the complexity of the Assessment Act.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree with the institute's suggestion that a better alternative is a grant system administered by DAAS, which is responsible for issuing certificates on which the rebate system is based anyway. I certainly hope that, when we come to power and attempt to simplify the Income Tax Assessment Act, the rebate system will be scrapped and replaced by an appropriate grants system administered by the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services or another appropriate authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that the institute rightly emphasises that expenditure may be totally unconnected to any income earning activity of the taxpayer and argues that there is no policy for including the rebate within the tax system as it merely adds to its complexity. We have received representations from the Australian Council of National Trusts which are not all that complimentary to the rebate scheme. It, too, states that the rebate `represents a most important initiative for heritage conservation in Australia'. But the praise stops there and the criticisms commence. The council indicates that it and other heritage organisations have  lobbied for a considerable time for the introduction of the scheme which was first mooted in Australia by the Hope inquiry in the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The council's major concern is that buildings or structures must be listed on Commonwealth, state or territory registers. There are particular problems in Tasmania; but I understand from Mr Cleary that the council is seeking to rectify those issues very quickly. In relation to that, during the committee stage I will be moving a couple of amendments&mdash;one to deal with a reduction from $10,000 in minimum expenditure to $5,000 and another in relation to the extension of the classified registers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the problem of the $2 million annual cap. Anyone would realise that capping curtails the full potential of a scheme and has a number of problems. Perhaps $2 million is a minuscule amount, albeit a step in the right direction. A more appropriate figure, I have been told with certainty, is of the order of $20 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of problems with this rebate scheme. Any expenditure incurred on work before a provisional certificate is issued will not be rebatable. Expenditure on the acquisition of depreciable plant and articles is not rebatable. No rebate is available if expenditure does not exceed the qualifying expenditure limit. For that reason we will be moving to bring the limit down from $10,000 to $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the issue of pensions and annuities. The  amendment extends the rebate currently enjoyed by superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities paid from a taxed source to superannuation pensions and roll-over annuities bought by rolling over an ETP representing the commutation of a deferred annuity or a pension from an untaxed superannuation fund. I note that it has taken the government only since 1988 to rectify this matter since once again the existing legislation unintentionally excluded immediate annuities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the issue of company instalments. The amendment lays down the grouping rules for company tax instalment arrangements and has the effect that all companies forming a group with a likely tax bill of greater than $300,000 per year and whose likely individual tax is over $8,000 must pay tax instalments according to the rules for `large' taxpayers. This makes a significant change to when tax is payable. A `small' taxpayer pays tax in one instalment 18 months after the start of the financial year, whilst large taxpayers pay in four instalments with the first due nine months after the start of the financial year, being 25 per cent of the estimated liability payable for the first three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Large companies will be required to lodge their tax returns on 1 December instead of 15 March. The issue at stake is how much or how far the government can squash the cash flow lemon of companies in Australia without impeding their competitiveness, profitability and available cash resources. This will be felt most by corporations with high manufacturing content&mdash;those with long lead times between the taking of raw materials and conversion into a manufactured state&mdash;or even miners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of this amendment, there is a substantial contraction of the time interval and a bunching effect during which returns must be prepared. The taxation environment in which companies operate today is constrictive. They must cope with initial tax, quarterly instalments and then extra taxes arising from changes to fringe benefits tax. This is due to the fact that previously certain expenses were not subject to FBT; they are now deductible but subject to FBT. This tax must also be paid during the year in which the benefit is paid to an employee. The whole tax scenario leads to a contraction in cash flow and additional payments by corporations in a contracted time interval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the penalty provision for new company tax instalment arrangements is amended to ensure that the penalty for underestimation of tax cannot be avoided by lodging two estimates in quick succession. I note that the group test applied for company instalment tax arrangements differs from that applicable in other taxation areas and I query why different tax approaches are used in different areas. For example, the group test for the transfer of tax losses is 100 per cent common ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In passing, I note that the extension of the eligibility of the tax concession on infrastructure borrowings to construct infrastructure facilities on land leased from the Commonwealth and to pay interest on direct infrastructure is clearly a step in the right direction. But I wonder whether the government has given sufficient consideration to the scope of some provisions if its objective is to truly encourage private sector involvement in infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite a few amendments are being made to the superannuation guarantee charge. They include making it clear that statutory authorities whose enabling legislation otherwise exempts them from Commonwealth taxation are liable for the superannuation guarantee charge; excluding lump sum payments for accrued leave, long service leave and sick leave on termination from the calculation of employer contributions; extending the superannuation guarantee charge to contractors; and deferring the quarterly superannuation guarantee charge obligations until 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be quite frank: none of these amendments address the real problems the superannuation guarantee charge scheme is riddled with. The government seems to ignore the many casual, part-time and itinerant workers whose superannuation benefits are eroded by taxes, fees and charges. I am pleased that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation will be examining this very matter through the taking of submissions and public hearings later this year and that it will be reporting to the Senate. Someone has clearly got to look at this massive problem. The government's promises in August of last year to give high priority to resolving the problems has unfortunately fallen by the wayside or its timetable has slipped. I am glad that all these people do not have to wait to see how long this government defines as high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is extremely concerned that the government is widening the `employee' net so that contractors will also be caught. Would it not be far better to eradicate the patently clear problems first and then bring others within the ambit of an effective superannuation scheme?

Many of the government amendments to the bill, however, despite the fact that it is classified as a bill that does not impose taxation, are to be moved in the form of requests for amendments because the view is taken that they will increase the liability to taxation and therefore fall within the third paragraph of section 53 of the constitution insofar as they would `increase any proposed charge or burden on the people'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that a very important paradox is quite apparent here. How can an amendment increase a proposed charge or burden on the people when the bill to be amended is classified as a bill which does not impose taxation and, therefore, presumably, does not propose any charge or burden on the people? How can a bill which could be introduced in the Senate because it is not a bill imposing taxation then be amended in such a way as to increase the burden of taxation? Can the Senate introduce a bill which it cannot itself amend in that way? If the proposed amendments have to be requests because they would increase a charge or burden on the people, then does it not follow that the provisions in the amendments actually impose taxation?</PARA>

We should never forget that last year's post-election budget was unequivocally a budget of deceit and betrayal. We got election promises, hype in the government's proposals and promises, and glad words before the election about no increases in taxation. We had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) saying just three months before the election, `What I am promising is not to put up tax. I do not think the incidence of tax should rise', and the then finance minister, now Treasurer (Mr Willis), just after the 1993 election saying that the government `does not intend to increase the overall burden of taxation'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these statements we have had, as a result of the re-election of the Keating government a year ago, across-the-board rises in wholesale sales tax of up to 20 per cent and a massive 30 per cent hike in petrol excise&mdash;7c a litre. There has been a major reneging on the government's so-called One Nation income tax cuts which were to be worth something like $8.5 billion. Only $3 billion worth of tax cuts was delivered and the remaining $5.5 billion worth was pushed off to never-never land,  which means that they will never be introduced. Of course, the government never intended that these cuts would be introduced because the government never thought it would be in a position where it had to honour that promise as it did not think it was going to win the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in a post-1993 budget and pre-1994 budget context where we have an electorate, a taxpaying community, which has seen all those promises shattered. In the current financial year, 1993-94, the taxation revenue was budgeted to equal 21.9 per cent of the gross domestic product. This year, on the estimates provided at the time of the last budget, and since revised, it rises to a whopping 22.8 per cent. On the government's own figures, that is an increase next year in real terms of 8.1 per cent. By 1996-97 it will, again on the government's own figures, have risen further to a figure of 23.5 per cent of gross domestic product. In other words, taxation revenue by 1996-97 will be not far short of one-quarter of total GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the situation where income tax, sales tax and petrol tax are higher and the fringe benefits tax burden is greater. It looks almost certain that we will have another hike in the Medicare levy this year&mdash;whether it rises from 1.25 per cent to the 2 per cent that the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) obviously wants or whether it is some figure in between, we will have to wait and see. What is quite certain is that there will be an increase in the Medicare levy. We look like having the prospect of another new tax in the form of a so-called jobs levy. Different words have been said about that, but it has not been ruled out yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are facing changes to the tax treatment of superannuation, which seems quite certain to result in another tax hike. So, we are, and have been for 12 months now, in an environment of high and rising taxes with no prospect of that turning around. Indeed, on the government's own expectations and forecasts publicly produced, far from any tax burden falling, the overall burden is forecast to increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to this year's budget, which is now only six or seven weeks down the track. The Treasurer has announced in his fiscal framework that the government believes there is a starting point deficit for 1994-95 of around $13 billion. That compares with what is expected to be an outturn for this year of something of the order of $14.75 billion&mdash;a far too high and unacceptable budget outturn. Yet, we have a starting point for the year about to commence of a figure not much less than that. Heaven only knows where it will finish up by the time the government determines its spending program on the whole raft of things it has said it will spend on. I think this would be a convenient point for me to break. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (1) As part of their promotional activities some chemical companies do sponsor landcare activities at the local, state and national levels. For example, Monsanto Australia is a sponsor of the Roundup Primary Producer Category in the National Landcare Australia Awards. The National Landcare Awards are organised by Landcare Australia Limited (LAL), a company established to encourage awareness and sponsorship of landcare. Acceptance of sponsorships by LAL should not be seen as endorsement of the sponsors' products, but rather as endorsement of landcare by the sponsoring companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The safe use of chemicals is consistent with achieving certain Landcare objectives. The use of sprays to control blackberries is one example. The use of weed killing sprays as part of minimum tillage cropping practices leading to reduced soil erosion and associated water pollution is another.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking to establish sustainable land use systems the National Landcare Program does not advocate any particular method of managing land, water and vegetation. The most appropriate management regime is a matter which the individual resource managers must decide, taking account of the best available information from all sources. It goes without saying that appropriate regimes need to take account of government regulations concerning natural resource use and chemical use.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In 1993 the Commonwealth established the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. Pesticides are thoroughly evaluated for safety to the environment and the user before they are registered. Possible side effects are taken into account in such evaluations. Chemical manufacturers are required to provide detailed information to substantiate any claims made in respect of their products. Only those chemicals which meet the established criteria are permitted to be released.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The appointment of a member to the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee to represent consumers is made under paragraph 45(1)(d) of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 ("the Act"). The term "consumer" is not defined in the Act, but following advice received from the Attorney-General's Department in 1991, the term "consumer" was broadly interpreted to mean either any member of the public or a consumer of new varieties or a consumer that uses products derived from new varieties as raw materials. The selection criteria to be fulfilled by the consumer representative are that the person so nominated must have, in the opinion of the selection committee which advises the Minister, appropriate experience and qualifications to adequately fulfil the function of representative of one or more categories of consumer. Weight in the selection process is also given to the representational breadth of the nominee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The first consumer representative was a solicitor with experience in public and administrative law nominated by the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations. The second representative was an agricultural economist with qualifications and research experience in the nature and socio-economic impact of plant variety rights. The nomination of the third and current representative was supported by the Council of Australian Food Technology Associations. This person has qualifications and research and development experience in developing consumer products from new varieties of agricultural crops. In its formative stages the Australian Plant Variety Rights Scheme and the legislation on which it is based has gained appreciably from the cumulative advice received from the breadth of experience of the consumer representatives that have represented a wide spectrum of relevant consumer interests in plant variety rights.</PARA>
