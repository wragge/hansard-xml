<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans. I refer the minister to the August balance of payments figures, which revealed a deficit of $2.1 billion for that month, the third highest on record, and the continued trend decline in Australia's balance of payments situation. As the trade deficit has recorded monthly deficits of $1.4 billion, $1.7 billion, $1.8 billion, $1.6 billion, $1.8 billion and now this $2.1 billion over the last six months, what policy changes will the government be implementing to address this looming crisis, or is Australia going to continue to go through the boom-bust cycle of Labor's economic policy?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1293" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While the debt service ratio remains as low as it is, it is absolutely nonsensical to talk in terms of the balance of payments situation as constituting any kind of serious problem for the Australian economy. The rise in the current account deficit in August was, of course, mainly due to a rise in investment related imports. Too much weight should not be placed on any month's figures, and that is particularly true of August and its outcome because of not only the very high general level of monthly volatility that applies in these estimates but, for example, the particular impact that was made in the August figures by the two Qantas aircraft, valued at $248 million alone, which happened to be part and parcel of those figures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlook for the current account deficit is not simply a matter, as we all should know by now&mdash;although we go through this idiotic process almost every month with the opposition seeking to score points&mdash;of extrapolating a few months' estimates, as some media commentators and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate have done. The truth of the matter is that some deterioration in the current account deficit was always to be expected at this stage of the cycle, given the underlying strength of the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investment is now unquestionably and unequivocally growing strongly, with underlying plant and equipment investment, for example, rising 15.6 per cent over the year to June. This is, of course, increasing imports of capital equipment. Those imports will, as again we have said on innumerable occasions, increase Australia's productive capacity, increase our future income, and increase in particular our capacity to make further export income and, as such, have a positive impact in the longer term on the balance of payments itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufactured exports continue to respond very well indeed to the improved economic environment. Our international competitiveness has improved by around 30 per cent over the last 10 years. It is being further helped by continuing low inflation and wage rises and by strong productivity growth. We had exports of ETMs&mdash;elaborately transformed manufactures&mdash;growing by 16 per cent in the last financial year, 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the runs are on the board. Everyone knows that the Australian economy is growing as well as that of any other developed economy in the world; in fact, substantially better than the overwhelming majority of them. All the basic elements are there for a continuation of that strong growth. That strong growth is unquestionably taking the form of a surge in investment related imports at the moment. That in turn will feed back into the productive capacity of the economy and our ability to make more returns from exports in the future. It is exactly where we would expect to be at this stage of the economic cycle. Those opposite should stop whingeing about it and get on with the job for once and be a little bit more helpful and productive in their own approach to the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. The problem is that we are hearing exactly the same from this government as we heard in the lead-up to the worst recession in 60 years: that is, the minister in the late 1980s came in here and said, `Don't worry about it because the debt service ratio is okay and, in any event, it is only an importation of capital goods.' My supplementary question therefore is: if we are having the same scenario that is going to lead to the same disastrous result as last time, with one million Australians out of work and the worst recession in 60 years, why will this government not tackle it in a different way from last time? Last time the government's solution was to push up interest rates, which is what is occurring again in this instance, with the disastrous consequences that I mentioned. That is why we are asking the minister why he does not find a different way to approach the cycle this time, instead of seeing Australia go through another boom and bust with the same tragic results as last time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate does not know or does not want to know the basic realities about the underlying strengths of this economy following the entire process that we went through during the 1980s. We have a much stronger position right now than we had at any stage during the 1980s&mdash;in particular, in those years just before the last recession. We have strength in the underlying growth rate, now running at around 4 1/2 per cent. We have strength in the underlying inflation rate, down to around two to 2 1/2 per cent. We have strength in the basic productivity gains that are being made and consolidated. We have strength in the continuing industrial relations environment and the productivity that continues to be delivered by that. We have strength in the low interest rate regime which is applicable at the moment and which will be maintained, notwithstanding adjustments that are obviously going to be necessary from time to time, as is always the case when we get into an economic cycle of this particular kind in the recovery phase.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LH4">Senator JONES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans. Following reports of massive numbers of Iraqi troops near Iraq's border with Kuwait, I ask: can the minister inform the Senate of the Australian government's position in light of these recent reports? Further, what is the current situation involving any Australians in Kuwait or Iraq? Has Australia been approached to provide any military support to allied deployments in the gulf?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1295" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The latest information available to me is that seven divisions of Iraqi troops have moved to within 25 to 30 kilometres of the border with Kuwait. Iraqi troops do not at this stage appear to be operationally ready for an invasion of Kuwait; however, their proximity to the border and the presence of major elements of three divisions of Iraq's elite Republican Guard do, of course, give rise for some concern in that respect. Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's intentions are unclear. They certainly have not been made public. He has not indicated the purpose of these troop movements and he has not given a reliable assurance that Iraq harbours no aggressive intention towards Kuwait.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to these developments it is, of course, the case that Kuwait has initiated defensive deployments of its own and it has called on military support from the United States and the United Kingdom, which has been provided to the extent that the US has deployed 4,000 troops to Kuwait, placed another 14,000 on special alert and is moving an aircraft carrier into the region. The UK is also in the process of deploying naval assets to the gulf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been, I suppose, the general assessment&mdash;it is shared by our own officials who are tracking and monitoring these events very closely&mdash;that it is unlikely that there will be an aggressive act against Kuwait in the near future; but, of course, nobody is making any absolute assumptions about that and the readiness to deal with a situation of this kind, should it arise, is as I have described it. The view that has been taken is that, given the lack of operational readiness that presently exists among the Iraqi troops, the time taken to gain operational readiness would be ample for necessary counterforce deployments to be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While no-one is entirely clear about what the Iraqi motives are in this whole affair, clearly their behaviour does seem linked to the question of the continued application of sanctions and, in this context, any further Iraqi moves seem likely to follow or be delayed until the release in New York today&mdash;New York time&mdash;of the report of the head of the UN Special Commission, which has the responsibility of ensuring the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction. Iraq has demanded that that report set a time frame for monitoring the elimination of these weapons, after which the council would consider the lifting of sanctions against Iraq. We will need to await, I guess, the course of events over the next 24 hours in relation to the content of that report and Iraq's reaction to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the Australian position, we certainly fully support the statement by the President of the Security Council two days ago emphasising the necessity for Iraq to fully implement all relevant Security Council resolutions and reaffirming the Security Council's commitment to Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Apart from two Australian Defence Force personnel serving with the UN Special Commission in Baghdad, Australia has no military personnel or units presently in the gulf. There has been no approach to the Australian government to contribute to the current defensive build-up in Kuwait.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, has been in contact with the Australian community in Kuwait, which reports that the situation in Kuwait City remains quite calm. Arrangements are in place for liaison and rapid communication of advice on the situation within the Australian community. We will continue to closely monitor the situation and will remain in close contact in particular with the Australian community in Kuwait through our embassy in Riyadh and also with the Australian community in Iraq, including Care Australia representatives in northern Iraq, through our embassy, in this case, in Amman.</PARA>

I further imagine that, in the present environment, the Prime Minister will have no hesitation whatsoever in entering into a very long lease indeed in order to lease out that particular property and derive a sufficient income from it.

I know that Senator Evans will find it difficult to comprehend, but this is a matter of principle, apart from the fact that the Prime Minister now obviously seeks to negatively gear this property to avoid tax. By the Prime Minister's own admission, he borrowed money&mdash;as he said, he `hocked the super on the future'&mdash;to pay $430,000 for his half-ownership of the piggery group that he `disposed of' to his impecunious partner, Mr Constantinidis, for an undisclosed amount. That, by the way, was in breach of the tax act. Mr Keating is now buying this Woollahra mansion for $2.2 million&mdash;a total of $2.6 million on pigs and mansions, the same total that a foreign Singapore-based company, JGL Trading Ltd with Hong Kong directors and an Indonesian association, recently invested in Euphron Pty Ltd, his former piggery holding company.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry, Senator Boswell: the opposition seems to have lost interest in the drought. The package announced on 21 September is part of an ongoing process. Commonwealth government expenditure either made or committed to this drought is now in excess of a quarter of a billion dollars. I will take a further submission to cabinet addressing long-term issues such as taxation incentives to encourage farmers to better plan for drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought package is targeted at farmers in extreme drought. This is consistent with the national drought policy that was agreed between the Commonwealth and states in 1992, which recognised extreme drought as that which good managers could not be expected to factor into their risk planning. The current package is aimed at those farmers in exceptional circumstances areas. Areas in which support is not available will attract assistance as they meet the exceptional circumstances test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications for the drought relief payment commenced today, with back payment to 1 October. Payment will be equivalent to the jobsearch allowance but, unlike other income support payments, only non-farm assets will be taken into account in the assets test. Recipients of the drought relief payment will automatically qualify for the health care card, and their farm assets are excluded from the assets test for Austudy. For a family with three children, one of whom is attending a tertiary institution, the package is worth around $25,000 a year.</PARA>

The introduction of the drought relief payment is accompanied by increased funding and changing of the administration of the exceptional circumstances provisions of RAS. The package announced on 21 September changed the funding of RAS exceptional circumstances provisions to a demand-driven program. In addition, the total amount of RAS support available to an individual farm enterprise has been increased from a maximum annual limit of $50,000 to $100,000, while the cumulative limit over five years has been lifted from $100,000 to $300,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our diplomacy is also, I guess, characterised in a number of these instances by a quality of patience because we do believe that there are many kinds of human rights achievements and advances which are likely to be realised only in a context of changing economic circumstances or things of this kind which will create those kinds of pressures. It is not a matter of waiting for that to occur and not taking any other steps; it is a matter of recognising that that is another element which is sometimes part of the equation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the particular context of East Timor and the Amnesty report that Senator Kernot has quoted, our concern is that that report is not anything other than a campaign document. It is not an objective or a measured or balanced analysis of the situation either in Indonesia overall or in East Timor in particular. It is the case that the trends in human rights performance in Indonesia are not measured in that report in any kind of balanced or carefully assessed way. While it is the case that Indonesian performance still falls well short of international human rights standards in many respects&mdash;and the report quite correctly points that out&mdash;it does fail to note that by historical standards there have indeed been significant improvements; and that has to be taken into account in making any assessment of where Indonesia has come from and where it is going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the case that that report wholly obscures the improvements which unquestionably have taken place in economic and social rights, whatever may be the case or whatever Senator Kernot's assessment may have been when focused solely on civil and political rights. It is important that that be taken into account in any fair assessment of the situation in East Timor, just as elsewhere in Indonesia. The report is also weak, I think, and unhelpful to the extent that it does not make any constructive suggestions at all about processes which might actually improve the human rights situation, particularly at this crucial period of transition in Indonesian society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in East Timor is not as good as we would like it to be, but there is no element of complacency that I can discern among the governing and other elites in Indonesia about that state of affairs. The whole question about the best way to move forward a reconciliation process in East Timor is the subject of very lively and intense and very current discussion in Jakarta right now. I had an opportunity last week in the United Nations in New York to contribute something further to that discussion, and I believe that now, as indeed more generally, the best way Australia can move the situation forward in East Timor, which unquestionably needs to be done, is through making suggestions and being persistently encouraging and persistently quite carefully descriptive in our representations to the Indonesian government against the background of a multidimensional relationship with Indonesia, which will ensure that our voice will be heard and will be taken seriously.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The peace process in Bougainville so far as the conference is concerned is only in its very early stages. The conference was scheduled to start today, as Senator Loosley has said. Reports most recently available to me indicate that it has commenced on schedule, but we have not as yet had a complete readout on the extent of the participation in it, the particular individuals and those others in attendance and their representative status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BRA commander, Sam Kauona, is understood to have travelled to Bougainville last night, notwithstanding some recent indications that he was not going to attend the conference; and that obviously is a good sign. The Bougainville cease-fire committee, which does include BRA representation, has been working actively to maintain conditions for the conference to proceed. I should say in that respect that we are, of course, aware of reports that several individuals, including members of the PNGDF, were wounded by gunfire yesterday, but that was an isolated instance for which the BRA has denied responsibility and it is our assessment that that will not disrupt the peace process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where a wide cross-section of Bougainvillians and representatives from the PNG government are expected to be at this conference, including representatives from church groups, unions, women's groups and the interim authorities covering the various regions of the island. We also welcome the presence of UN observers and administrative support for the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Pacific peacekeeping force, which was formed to facilitate these talks, is now fully deployed with an advance party having arrived in Arawa two days ago to prepare for the arrival of the main contingent yesterday. There are about 400 personnel involved in the operation, with Fiji supplying some 230, Tonga 110 and Vanuatu 50. Australia is providing HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> which, anchored as it is in Arawa Bay, will be the combined force headquarters, and HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Success</EMPHASIS> which will provide supply support. We are also making available Black Hawk helicopters and Caribou aircraft to assist in transport and logistic requirements and up to 50 personnel, as required, to undertake logistic communications, medical and movement support for the contingent actually on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presence of this peacekeeping force was provided for under the Honiara commitments to peace on Bougainville, which were signed, as honourable senators will recall, by PNG Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan and BRA Commander Kauona, on 3 September. The force is operating under a multilateral status of forces agreement signed by the governments concerned. It is intended to play a wholly neutral role and in fact will play quite a limited role in support of the peace process. It is essentially a role of providing security for the participants at the peace conference now under way. It will also have a role monitoring the situation in declared neutral zones at Panguna, Buin and Wakunai. We have been happy to provide support, as requested, to that force. At the same time, I repeat what I have said previously publicly: we have underlined to the PNG government and others directly involved that they alone are responsible for the conduct and outcome of the peace conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that the conference will conclude on 16 October with a peace ceremony. There is no proposal for a continuing or open-ended peacekeeping presence on Bougainville. If that peace ceremony does go ahead, as is hoped, on the weekend of 16 October, a number of representatives will be there from neighbouring countries including, I hope, me, representing Australia, and hopefully also the Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, Emeka Anyaoku, to demonstrate our witnessing, as it were, of what we are all hoping will be a very successful process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obviously too early to make a judgment about how successful this process will be but certainly it remains, as I have said before, far and away the most helpful development that we have seen in the resolution of this distressing ongoing conflict in Bougainville. Once again, I think the committee headed by Senator Loosley is to be thanked for the work that it did in creating the environment for this process to proceed and, in particular, for the concept of this conference to take hold as it has. We can all only hope that there will be a successful outcome.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two reasons why I have not responded in detail to that leaked document: firstly, because, in accordance with established government practice, it is not appropriate to comment on leaked documents; and secondly, because in the present circumstances when we are all trying very hard to resolve a very delicate and difficult situation with the hostages, I do not think it would be helpful to do so. However, given the fact that Senator Teague has repeated once again the canard which has constantly been echoed, I have noticed, in newspaper reports and editorial comment over the last few days about my alleged statements on this subject, let me get once and for all the chronology straight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the case that the contents of this cable are inconsistent with the assessments that I have been giving publicly about the situation in Cambodia. The last time I did express some very real confidence that things were generally going very well in Cambodia was on the occasion of my last actual visit there in April this year&mdash;8 and 9 April. But it was only a couple of weeks after that, on 19 April, that the debacle occurred in which the Khmer Rouge recaptured Pailin from Cambodian government troops with a lot of consequential adverse morale effects flowing from that to the government itself, with a degree of fragility and vulnerability creeping into the administration of the country in a whole variety of ways as a result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that happened I have been very careful indeed in all of my public statements about the situation in Cambodia and have often pointed to the fragility and vulnerability of the situation and the need for those of us around the world genuinely committed to the country to be prepared to be as helpful as we can and as responsive as we can to this new, very difficult phase in the evolution of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the further point, however, that the cable in question is dated June; it is now October. The sky has not fallen in during the intervening period. I am not entirely clear what Senator Teague or anyone else is getting so excited about. I have never made any secret of the fact that a country such as Cambodia, emerging as it is from decades of civil war and the most horrific abuses of human rights, can hardly be expected to turn into a fully functioning democracy overnight. I have also made no secret of the fact that Australia&mdash;and I myself&mdash;has constantly made vigorous representations to the highest levels of the Cambodian government and its armed forces about individual cases of abuse, about the need for a widening and deepening of democratic structures and about a general need for reform in a number of governing institutions, not least the military.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite some inevitable hitches along the way, our assessment, and that of others, including people such as Justice Michael Kirby, the UN Special Representative on Human Rights, is that progress is being made on most of these fronts. We, of course, are continuing to play our part in the international effort to reconstruct Cambodia, including in the propagation and consolidation of democratic norms, by providing assistance to the Cambodian government and to non-governmental bodies aimed, among other things, at building and strengthening democratic institutions and the rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I continue to believe very strongly, as Mr Holloway does&mdash;and let it not be forgotten that this is a central part of the assessment of Mr Holloway, if this document is to be regarded as an accurate representation of his views&mdash;that the democratically elected government of Cambodia remains that country's best hope for the future. It is also the case that, as his health permits, King Sihanouk will continue to play a very important role, as will other institutions and people in prominent places in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no intention&mdash;this government has no intention whatsoever&mdash;of walking away from the responsibility that the international community has taken for Cambodia. I believe that just about everyone else around the world who has taken a responsible interest in this would take a similar view. The key to the country's future prosperity is economic growth and development. That requires security. The alternative&mdash;a resurgence of the Khmer Rouge&mdash;is simply too horrible to contemplate. Details of how we might best respond to the situation in which the country finds itself are still being worked out by a number of countries with which we have been discussing these things. They will be considered by the Australian government in due course. I do not intend to pre-empt any further decision we might make in this respect by any further comment at this stage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a few contenders for the honour of being Senator Margetts's most muddled question in this place, but I have to say that that one is getting pretty close, in terms of the suggestions in it that Australia's participation and logistic role in the peacekeeping force somehow involves a breach or a potential breach of the cease-fire agreement entered into by Sir Julius Chan and Sam Kauona. It cannot conceivably be characterised in that role. The Australian force is not playing any role other than that of logistic support in order to get on the ground the 230 personnel from Fiji, the 110 personnel from Tonga and the 50 personnel from Vanuatu who constitute the peacekeeping forces. It is only Australia in the region that had the logistic capacity to move those sorts of numbers quickly to get them in there in accordance with the timetable that Sir Julius Chan had agreed with his BRA interlocutor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been playing what I think has been universally perceived as a helpful role in this respect. It is not an active role on the ground in any way other than that I have described. We retain some overall coordinating responsibility for it because of our logistic role and the necessity to coordinate all the elements coming together in this way, but the command of the force on the ground is with the Tongan and Fijian commanding officers, not with the Australians. That remains the case. The Australian role in this respect was well understood, I think, in prospect at the time of the cease-fire agreement and has certainly been very well understood since as a result of detailed conversations that have taken place with the BRA about the nature of this exercise and the nature of Australia's role in it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said publicly in this Senate, it is only on the basis of a clear understanding by the BRA of Australia's involvement that we would ever become involved, because we are not in the business of trying to impose ourselves in an unhelpful way on this situation. Our intentions are wholly constructive and, in the way this has evolved so far, I think the effect has been wholly constructive. At this stage we do not know what the outcome of this process will be during this week; we can only hope that the process that has been set in train, the confidence-building mechanisms associated with it and the security supplied for it, will all work their effect and create an environment in which the obvious desire of the people for peace can be translated into some formal and final agreement, or some peace agreement which gives us all hope that this issue can be resolved.</PARA>

What this process needs at the moment is an injection of confidence, not an injection of cynicism, scepticism and rank despair of the kind Senator Margetts has communicated in her question. There is no basis for it in terms of the way in which we or anyone else have been trying to handle this problem.

There are six rural land protection board districts in New South Wales&mdash;Mudgee, Merriwa, Dubbo, Scone, Nyngan and Grafton&mdash;all of which qualify for the Prime Minister's drought package according to the Rural Assistance Authority in New South Wales.

I am pleased that Senator Brownhill has given me the opportunity to say a few words about this because the actions that the New South Wales minister for agriculture, Mr Causley, took in raising the hopes of people without foundation are regrettable, and I think `regrettable' would be a polite word for it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is right. I know that he was concerned about his own electorate, which in fact was the one district, can I say&mdash;not six districts&mdash;that last week we got down to arguing about. There was no argument at official level on the clear ineligibility of five of those six districts that were on a draft list. They did not qualify for the 24 out of 36 qualification; in fact, they came nowhere near it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The integrity of this very substantial package of assistance has to be defended, not just in the farming community but elsewhere in the Australian community. The only way it can be defended is if the guidelines set up are adhered to. These were the guidelines that not only were agreed at the ARMCANZ meeting but, at Mr Causley's insistence, we actually shook hands on&mdash;24 out of 36. The original guidelines provided for two years of continuous drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said publicly at the time, they would have been totally defendable criteria to use for the benefits of this significant package&mdash;two years. I do not think that anyone would argue that one year of drought would be an extreme drought. I have changed the drought guidelines that apply to Queensland. Had the original guidelines been applied to New South Wales&mdash;they were criteria suggested by the shadow minister and I quoted from his press conference on the drought&mdash;six rural districts in New South Wales would have qualified. I deliberately revised those guidelines from two years continuous drought to 24 months out of 36 to assist farmers in New South Wales&mdash;that is, any 24 months out of the previous 36. That was to cater for farmers who had dry years in 1991 and 1992 and are currently droughted, but actually had good crops last year. This will allow them still to qualify. The opposition's proposed definition would have provided for six districts to be assisted; we are providing for 15 districts in New South Wales to receive assistance under the amended criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I made public last week that we provided a draft list to New South Wales officials. I am sure that Senator Brownhill would concede that a lot of work has had to be done on this package. We have had to line up a whole lot of social security officers very quickly indeed to handle a whole new form of payment from today on to get the money out. We have had to draft a whole stack of legislation. A lot of work has been done&mdash;and I must say cooperatively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A draft list was issued at official level with the word `draft' stamped on it in letters an inch high. I am happy to table that draft. Mr Causley faxed that list to his National Party mates and media outlets all across New South Wales. We know where it came from because we see `Minister for Agriculture' at the top of the fax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of people in crisis were hanging on every word that came from the governments of New South Wales and the Commonwealth. For a minister to fax out a draft list which had not been confirmed by either the New South Wales government or the Commonwealth was indeed a cruel thing to do. That list was revised. I asked my department to triple-check all the draft listings, and a small number were removed. I condemn the minister for agriculture in New South Wales for circulating this list to his National Party mates and to a number of media outlets in New South Wales. That is how this list was circulated. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

In answer to an earlier question, the minister said that exceptional circumstances are applied where the drought has gone beyond people's ability to cope. If there has been drought in 24 of the last 41 months, one is aware that it has gone beyond a farmer's capability to cope.

I repeat that it was appallingly irresponsible for the minister for agriculture in New South Wales to circulate to media outlets and to National Party members, who then put out press statements, a list that has stamped on it, in letters an inch high, the word `Draft'.

I refer to the good fortune of American citrus growers who continue to enjoy between 40 and 47 per cent protection against Brazilian orange juice concentrate while Australia, according to the government, must dismantle its sales tax concession for local content. Why did the government cut Australian tariff protection against imported fruit juice concentrates to the ridiculously low level of 10 per cent, reducing further to five per cent, when it must have been aware that the Uruguay Round of GATT would demolish protection through the sales tax system?

The Australian Democrats were starting to establish a little credibility around the place for putting forward economically coherent proposals; now they are back to their bad old ways. In fact, they were starting to take the place of this useless lot opposite as the people who articulated alternative economic positions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I want to put some facts on the table and then point out some of the contradictions. The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade is exactly that: an agreement. We cannot impose it on other people. We all have to agree. It is not an Australian edict that we tell everybody else what they have to do; it is an agreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to explain to the Democrats a bit of basic arithmetic. It does not make sense to pose here as opponents of indirect tax and advocates of tariffs. A tariff on orange juice puts up the price of orange juice. The Democrats are opposed to indirect taxes because they put up the price of essentials. They spent the whole of the last election purporting to agree with us that they do not like indirect taxes because they put up the price of basic essentials. But here they are wanting higher tariffs on orange juice and higher tariffs on clothes, which will mean that the price of food and clothing will be more expensive. They cannot at the same time credibly hold both those positions. It is in fact against the interest of the Australian primary producers to do it, and they do not want it done. It is against the interest of Australian consumers, and they do not want it done. It is just another part of the myth.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Michael Baume this day, relating to the purchase of real estate by the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>In response to my question, Senator Evans chose not to ask Mr Keating to explain how he could afford to buy a Woollahra mansion for $2.2 million, which is more than the total take-home pay the Prime Minister has earned during his 25 years as a parliamentarian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that this chamber&mdash;in fact, the people of Australia&mdash;would like to know how Mr Keating has been able to avoid the effects of the `recession we had to have', that is, his recession, in which tens of thousands of ordinary Australians have lost their homes and businesses, particularly those in rural Australia, who note the extraordinary difference between the treatment of Mr Keating's piggery group where $4 1/2 million was provided for as a bad debt by the Commonwealth Bank, while at the same time the Commonwealth Bank appeared to be enthusiastically putting other primary producers off their farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Prime Minister, as he promised in the 1989 budget, has brought home the bacon. He has brought home the bacon to himself and left the rest of the carcass very badly used for the rest of Australia. Continuing the analogy of bringing home the bacon, in order to get this sort of money he seems to have had some kind of snout in the trough. No doubt there will be enough room for many people at his Thai teak table. No doubt there will be plenty of room for French clocks and Gould prints in the Keating mansion. That is, of course, if he can magically find the money to borrow or acquire all these items, just as he managed to acquire his mansion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear from Senator Gareth Evans today that all this is simply a commercial venture&mdash;that he bought it in order to lease it out at a very high rent. We know already that this was a mate's price when he bought it because the former owner said, `Really, it is worth a lot more than $2.2 million,' and that this was just a mate's price to the Prime Minister. Quite frankly, no Prime Minister should put himself in a position where he gets a special price for something, because that implies clearly some benefit to the Prime Minister&mdash;he is under some obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he managed to buy this mansion for a mate's price, we wonder what kind of a mate's lease will happen now. Will there be a mate's lease whereby someone pays some specially high leasing price, just as the Prime Minister paid a specially low purchase price? The Prime Minister should not be in a position where he would be under any such obligation, although I suppose that quite a few people would like to provide the Prime Minister with a benefit by paying him a handsome rent on his mansion because there are many matters where, in fact, people do stand to gain from governmental decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be, of course, that this special mate's rent is high enough for the Prime Minister even to avoid the need for negative gearing, because one gets negative gearing, which would quite properly and legally reduce one's tax liability, only where one's rent is lower than one's interest payments. It might be appropriate in these particular and extraordinary circumstances for the Prime Minister, when he does make such a lease, to advise the parliament of it and of the terms of it so there can be no suggestion of any kind of impropriety, any kind of mate's rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one thinks of the times when the Prime Minister has criticised others&mdash;particularly those on this side&mdash;for having made quite proper arrangements with housing in order to minimise their tax liabilities by negative gearing, one finds it interesting to see whether this Prime Minister will admit, if it is the case, that he has negatively geared in, as I have said, a legally proper way to minimise his tax. He held himself up to be a puritan on the issue of tax when he attacked our former leader on this very issue. He said, `You can see that the tax I paid is totally correct and proper because it has been audited.' That was, in fact, false; it was his company that had been audited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that I wonder whether the Prime Minister remembers telling a Sydney journalist, Jonathon Chancellor, `All you write about is fascist types upgrading their property or flash eastern suburbs types driving around in their second-hand Mercedes dragging their mortgages behind them.' Now that Mr Keating is adding a big mortgage to his longstanding second-hand Mercedes&mdash;that is the one photographed in Warren Anderson's driveway&mdash;by upgrading his property to a $2.2 million mansion, under which category should the Prime Minister be listed&mdash;a fascist property upgrader or a flash eastern suburbs type?</PARA>

But instead we got the invective and abuse that have become the trademark of the future member for Holt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that the people of Australia are entitled to know how somebody who has supposedly lived on a parliamentary salary for 25 years has the unique capacity, all of a sudden, to purchase a $2.2 million residence. If it is from other incomes earned, so be it, but then let him disclose it on the public register, as is required of other parliamentarians. If it is on the basis that he has borrowed moneys against his prospective superannuation payout, then let him say so publicly because we know that that would be in breach of Commonwealth laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might also indicate what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) intends to do in the very near future&mdash;possibly make way for the future member for Holt, we do not know. But how is he going to pay off this loan over a period of four or five years, if indeed there is a substantial loan? There would be a cash flow problem in the meantime. One wonders with this major property purchase whether the Prime Minister relied on his factional colleague from New South Wales Senator Stephen Loosley, who has this unique capacity to buy million dollar properties, but then of course to resell them at a loss. I trust that the Prime Minister did not rely on Senator Loosley's advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, the other possibility is that Senator Chris Evans arranged a loan for the Prime Minister. He seems to have a history of providing loans for certain people in the Australian Labor Party who are in financial strife. Of course, either of those scenarios relying on his Labor Party colleagues would be of concern to the people of Australia. The question has to be asked: how does he fund it, how does he pay off the loan, and how does he indeed pay the interest payments? They are serious questions relating to matters of proper concern and should be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating inherited the money, let him say so; if he won the money, let him say so. All that Senator Baume is seeking is an explanation.

There is no doubt that on 25 years of parliamentary salary the Prime Minister could not afford this house. Therefore, there must be some other source of funding which has not been disclosed to the people of Australia. Indeed, in the past the Labor Party has prided itself on public disclosure and the fact that people should not have anything to hide.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Evans is back. That excuse is always used when there is a high balance of payments blow-out, which is quite usual these days. I think it is time we started questioning Senator Evans when he says that. He did not quite specify how much they were or whether they were leased or purchased outright. If they were purchased outright, then that figure would add up to quite an amount and would tend to put things out of kilter in the average month. If they happen to be leased, it is only the monthly lease, I presume, that would have gone out because I presume that they are leased from an overseas consortium. In that case, it would only be the monthly lease. If it was an outright purchase, surely that outright purchase price is reduced by the 22-odd per cent&mdash;I think that is the correct figure&mdash;which British Airways owns of Qantas. That would have a deflating effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In future when this minister uses that excuse I think that he should be more definite, because there are various ways of financing those jets. The annual report of Qantas refers to multicurrency financing, hire purchase and finance deals. There is mention in the latest report of the airline of moving towards outright purchase. If we are moving towards outright purchase, I find that hard to believe, otherwise the report would have mentioned that that figure had been arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I question the fact that the minister has used this excuse. Perhaps at another time he will tell us exactly how much Qantas has purchased. It has to be fitted in somewhere in the 12 months. Before he uses that excuse again, and we listen to him as if it is gospel, he should come back and tell us how much it causes an extra blow-out in one particular month. </PARA>

But Senator Evans also knows, because he gets these background briefings&mdash;and we know he gets them&mdash;that the August current account figure of $2.14 billion is just a little more serious than he made it out to be today. The market reaction has been very cutting and very deep, because there is now a newly coined phrase going around the marketplace.

This dynamic inconsistency is now being factored into economic decisions in the marketplace&mdash;in particular, of course, by the bond dealers. So the government has to come to grips with this new phenomenon&mdash;that the marketplace simply does not believe the government's statements anymore. I do not say the statements are coming from the Treasury, because the Treasury has taken the line of the markets; nor are they coming from the Reserve Bank. They are simply coming from the ministers and the offices of the ministers' nearest advisers. </PARA>

Even he now believes it is crunch time for the government in relation to its current account, that it must now change its strategy. To quote Barry Hughes, there is considerable questioning of the wisdom of the government's growth aspirations. Professor Hughes has even adjusted the government's May current account deficit for 1994-95, believing it will blow out by $2.25 billion, taking it over the $20 billion mark. </PARA>

The current drought means that higher interest rates are unavoidable.

Sir Nigel Hubert Bowen AC, KBE, member of the House of Representatives for the division of Parramatta from 1964 to 1973, Attorney-General from 1966 to 1969 and in 1971, Minister for Education and Science from 1969 to 1971, Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1971 to 1972, and former Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia from 1976 to 1990, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</PARA>
<PARA>Nigel Hubert Bowen was born on 26 May 1911 at Summerland, British Columbia. He came to Australia as a young boy, was educated at King's School, Parramatta, and studied law at St Paul's College, Sydney University. He was admitted to the New South Wales bar in 1936 and later to the Victorian bar. With the advent of World War II he enlisted in the Australian Military Forces in 1941, before transferring to the Second AIF in 1942. He served in the South Pacific region for two years, then transferred to the Reserves in 1946 with the rank of captain. Sir Nigel resumed his legal career and took silk in 1953. He spent some time as President of the New South Wales Bar Council and from 1957 to 1960 held the post of Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1963, Sir Nigel stood for, and won, the seat of Parramatta, which had been vacated by the resignation of Sir Garfield Barwick. In 1966, building on his already distinguished and successful legal career, he was appointed Attorney-General in the Holt ministry. He served in this portfolio in successive ministries until November 1969, making a brief return to the portfolio in 1971. From 1969 to 1971 he was Minister for Education and Science and from 1971 to 1972 he was Foreign Minister in the McMahon government. His parliamentary record shows that he also led numerous delegations on visits within Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel left the parliament in 1973 to take up an appointment as Chief Judge in Equity in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. This was followed by his appointment in 1976 as the first Chief Judge&mdash;later Chief Justice&mdash;of the then newly created Federal Court of Australia, a position he held with distinction until his retirement in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in that capacity as Chief Judge of the Federal Court that I had a great deal, personally, to do with Sir Nigel when I was Attorney-General in 1983-84. I have to say that I have nothing but the fondest memories of those encounters. He was a tough advocate for his court, as he had been for his clients at the bar, but he was always a charming, gentlemanly and wholly constructive person to deal with, never losing sight of the public policy goals that we were mutually trying to achieve in judicial administration at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His appointment to set up and head the new Federal Court was a particularly appropriate culmination to Sir Nigel's public career, as he had long perceived the need for the establishment of a Commonwealth superior court below the High Court. Indeed, it was Sir Nigel who as Attorney-General in 1968 first introduced a bill for the establishment of such a court. Although that bill was not proceeded with, it provided much of the foundation for the Federal Court of Australia Act that was eventually passed in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In setting up the Federal Court, Sir Nigel was responsible for much of the procedural innovation for which the court is still highly regarded. He also played a significant part in developing the court's approach to the Commonwealth's administrative law jurisdiction, an area of the law in which Sir Nigel had a great interest. As Attorney-General in 1968, he had initiated the inquiry undertaken by the Commonwealth Administrative Review Committee. That committee's report in 1971 formed the basis for the many remarkable developments in administrative law that took place later in the decade: the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; the setting up of the Commonwealth Ombudsman; and the passage of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. A true Australian, it was also Sir Nigel who, with the Privy Council (Limitation of Appeals) Act 1968, began the process of making the High Court the final court of appeal in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel will also be remembered for his chairing of the Committee of Inquiry concerning Public Duty and Private Interest which was established in February 1978 and reported in July 1979. The Bowen committee's report was an extremely thorough piece of work, reflecting Sir Nigel's very sound judgment. Over the years the report has become an authoritative source for dealing with the various ethics and conflict of interest issues which parliamentarians, judicial and statutory office-holders and public servants have to address from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel Bowen was a hard working and dedicated man who served the Australian people outstandingly well in both his legal and political careers. In recognition of his great service to Australia, he received a knighthood in 1976 and in 1988 was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia, one of Australia's highest awards, for his services to the law. He will be sadly missed by all who knew him and who admired his contribution to Australian public life. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Ermyn and his family our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </PARA>

He subsequently became Chief Judge in Equity and, in 1976, the first Chief Justice of the Federal Court of Australia, a position which he held with distinction for 14 years until he retired in 1990.

In 1946 he became the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS>, a position he filled for the next 12 years.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Nigel entered parliament as the member for Parramatta in 1964 after the resignation of another eminent jurist and contemporary, Sir Garfield Barwick. Like Sir Garfield, Sir Nigel embarked on a political career relatively late in his professional life and, like Sir Garfield, held the portfolios of Attorney-General and foreign affairs. In Sir Nigel's first term as Attorney-General he initiated the abolition of appeals to the Privy Council. He was appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs by Harold Holt 2 1/2 years after entering parliament and filled that position for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Gorton appointed him Minister for Education and Science, a portfolio he held from late 1969 to early in 1971 when he was again appointed Attorney-General by Prime Minister McMahon. He held the portfolio for only five months before being appointed Minister for Foreign Affairs. As foreign affairs minister, Sir Nigel identified and articulated the emerging importance of Australia's relationship with Asia. In June of 1972 Sir Nigel was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are geographically very close to Asia and our future is very largely with the future of the countries in this region.</PARA>
<PARA>Sir Nigel played a leading role in galvanising international opinion in the Pacific basin against the atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons and led a push for Australia to gain membership of the United Nations Security Council. Sir Nigel said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extent to which we've been making our own decisions has been underestimated. If we find ourselves going along the same line as Britain or the U.S., it doesn't mean we are dancing to their tune. It means we have made a judgment and decided to do so. You make an independent judgment, but you don't make a fetish of being independent.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I wish to be associated with this condolence motion before the Senate and to make a few brief remarks.

His contributions to public life extended over a great many years and involved service in both the Gorton and McMahon coalition governments. His entry into politics was preceded by a distinguished legal career. It is clear that this remained his great professional passion in life, as he chose to devote himself to law after he left politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the highlights of Sir Nigel's early career in the law, his period as editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Law Journal</EMPHASIS> deserves to be recognised. It was noted by his peers of the time and by the present day Law Council of Australia that he served in this position with considerable distinction. Other notable highlights of his early career in the law included his appointment as a Queen's Counsel in the early 1950s and his terms as President of the New South Wales Bar Council from 1959 to 1961 as well as Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia from 1957 until 1960. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen took on a parliamentary career at the by-election for the federal seat of Parramatta in 1964. As has been noted, this seat was formerly held by another equally notable Liberal member in Sir Garfield Barwick. Nigel Bowen served as the member for Parramatta until 1973. During his career in federal parliament, Sir Nigel Bowen distinguished himself by ministerial service in a number of key policy areas at the time, including holding the portfolios of education, science, Attorney-General and foreign affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was perhaps during his period as Attorney-General that Nigel Bowen made his greatest contributions to the development of public policy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen was also responsible as Attorney-General for the decision to establish a new level of Australian legal jurisdiction in the Federal Court. The decision to establish the Federal Court was as much related to the government's view that the High Court needed relief from an increasing volume of litigation as it was to Nigel Bowen's own view that the High Court should be freed up to fulfil its original role as the place where the Australian constitution is ultimately interpreted. It should also be noted that Nigel Bowen was responsible for the initiative during his term as Attorney-General to abolish appeals to the Privy Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although his term as Minister for Foreign Affairs was a relatively short one, I note that Nigel Bowen had the foresight during his ministry to propose a number of initiatives that would put an end to nuclear testing in the Pacific.

This latter citation recognised Nigel Bowen's post-political career, which itself was equally notable and included appointments as a Chief Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and then later as Chief Justice of the Federal Court, a position he held until his retirement in 1990. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I offer his family our deepest sympathies at this time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became President of the New South Wales Bar Association in 1959, and in 1960 Vice-President of the Law Council of Australia. In 1964 Garfield Barwick became Chief Justice and Nigel Bowen replaced him in the Commonwealth parliament as member for Parramatta&mdash;a seat which had been held successively by ministers of state: Sir Frederick Stewart, Sir Howard Beale and Sir Garfield. The then Mr Bowen did not break that chain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had a deep concern for the people and their welfare; for the rights of women and the individual's rights in the face of government. His political life bears testimony to all those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1966 he became Attorney-General and immediately began a process of reform which reflected his fundamental political values. He thought it was time that the High Court became the ultimate court of appeal for Australia, and appeals were abolished from that court to the Privy Council. He established a committee under Sir John Kerr to report on a system of administrative review to protect the individual from Commonwealth bureaucracy, and a committee to reform the Judiciary Act to improve the federal system of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People had been talking about a new federal court for years. He acted. He settled and introduced a bill to establish such a court. In November 1969, however, he left the office of Attorney-General and became Minister for Education and Science, an office which he held with distinction but only for a short period. In August 1971 he became foreign minister until the McMahon government lost office in 1972. As foreign minister he met with representatives of the People's Republic of China in Paris and recommended to Mr McMahon that recognition should take place. The Prime Minister, it is said, consulted the DLP and decided not to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1972 Nigel Bowen appointed a delegation to negotiate the seabed boundaries between the then Indonesian West Timor and north-west Australia. In October 1972 he signed the treaty which recognised and accepted Australia's rights to the bulk of this seabed. This and other initiatives he undertook on the law of the sea were of immense significance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After the 1972 election many of his colleagues recognised his leadership potential. He stood for the position of Leader of the Opposition, but lost by one vote. How different the history of this country may have been had he won. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In politics both sides regarded him as a person of great quality and dignity. He did not engage in the game of rough, backroom, passageway politics&mdash;all too familiar to those who have been in this place. He emerged by the sheer quality and integrity of his personality as a leader among his peers. As Bob Ellicott said, he was a delightful colleague and his capacity was deeply missed by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By 1973 he was 62 and he became successively a judge of the New South Wales Court of Appeal and Chief Judge in Equity where the quality and dominance of his intellect and his sense of justice were quickly recognised. In 1976, when the Hon. Bob Ellicott was Attorney-General, the Federal Court of Australia Act was passed. It was not without controversy because the court was seen by some as a threat to the state supreme courts. It was essential to find a chief justice whose administrative and intellectual capacity would ensure its success, so Mr Ellicott approached Nigel Bowen. Under his leadership the future of the court was assured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He frequently sat in its appellate jurisdiction and, through his judgments, made significant contributions to the law it administered. Importantly, he was deeply involved in pioneering the implementation of the court's wide jurisdiction in trade practices and administrative law. His chief justiceship of the Federal Court was probably his greatest contribution to our national life&mdash;no doubt because he had the time to complete his task. The nation recognised his years of public service when he was created a Knight Bachelor and a Companion of the Order of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nigel Bowen was a great Australian. He loved his family: his widow Ermyn and his daughters Pam, Dianne and Vivienne and his brother John, to whom we express our condolences. </PARA>

<PARA>The Keating government is not only an arrogant government but also a complacent government. Arrogance and complacency are a lethal mix in their implications for all Australians. This government does not care about the enormous problems facing the Australian economy. This tired government does not give a damn for the damage that its complacency, arrogance and monumental incompetence heap on the Australian community, and particularly on the middle and lower income groups for whom it cruelly pretends to have concern and for whom it weeps crocodile tears. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are irrefutable, and they are contained in the wording of this matter of urgency that I bring to the Senate on behalf of the Liberal-National Party opposition. This tired, arrogant, complacent, incompetent Keating Labor government has failed monumentally to take the policy actions necessary to ensure Australia's economic and employment growth is placed on a sustainable base in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and his team sit back smugly and say that they did enough in the 1980s and the early 1990s to enable Australia to grow into the 21st century. Indeed, the former industry minister, then Senator Button, said here in 1992 that there were no more reforms left for this government to tackle. Mr Keating even had the arrogance in his quite sanctimonious, self-indulgent, self-congratulatory speech to the recent Australian Labor Party national conference to assert that Labor had `earned the right to lead Australia into the next century.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real facts, not those of the Labor Party's Orwellian rewriters of history, are that Labor has indeed abdicated all right to lead Australia not only into the 21st century but as of this very day. Look at the facts&mdash;those which represent the symptoms of our deep-seated malaise: the first is that continuing massive unemployment is now still at almost 10 per cent compared with eight per cent in New Zealand, six per cent in the United States and only two to three per cent in countries such as Hong Kong and Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second is the largest and most rapidly widening current account deficit of any OECD country&mdash;that is any Western nation&mdash;at over four per cent of GDP, and certain to finish the year much larger than that, compared with an average current account balance for all other OECD nations. Thirdly, there is the high cost of capital as reflected in our high real interest rates. Today, 10-year bonds in Australia now yield well over 10 per cent and real rates were around eight per cent in August compared with about 4 1/2 per cent in the United States, less than six per cent in New Zealand, 6.3 per cent in the UK and 4.1 per cent in Japan. Indeed, there are only two countries in the whole of the OECD area that have higher real interest rates than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, there is low investment. Private fixed capital expenditure in Australia is still at near record lows. Last year Access Economics produced figures which showed Australia's capital stock was actually shrinking, so low was investment that it was not even keeping up with replacement levels. Last financial year it amounted to only 15.4 per cent of GDP, some 5 1/2 per cent lower than its recent peak of 19.8 per cent in 1988-89. Even if the government achieves its forecast of a 14 1/2 per cent increase in expenditure this financial year, it will still only equal 16.9 per cent&mdash;well down on most previous years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, low national savings: household savings are still at near record lows at around five per cent of GDP, while the public sector is dissaving to the tune of over four per cent of GDP. According to the ANZ bank's savings report, the last two quarters are the first two quarters of overall national saving in almost three years. We in fact had eight consecutive quarters of dissaving before these last two. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to have this situation. There are no immutable laws to say that we cannot compete in the world. We used to do so before this incompetent government came along. There are things that can be done to address our problems, to put Australia back on track, to compete with and to win against our international competitors; but we must take the initiative. We must have a government that governs in the national interest, not one that governs in the interests of its mates, as has been the hallmark of the Hawke and Keating Labor governments of the last 11 long years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at some of those initiatives that should and indeed must be taken. Industrial relations reform: despite the general acceptance of the long overdue need for greater enterprise flexibility in the labour market this government, in cahoots with the ACTU leadership, has done everything it can to delay, disrupt and destroy attempts at genuine enterprise agreements&mdash;agreements that would leave all parties, employers, employees and the economy better off. But of course, Labor as the political wing of the labour movement, cannot cede power to the workers because if it did so the workers might realise what a waste the trade union leadership is and how it actually harms the workers' interests. This particular area of failed policy&mdash;industrial relations reform&mdash;is the worst example of sectional interest and power being put ahead of the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Commonwealth-state financial relations: the issue of fair and equitable financial arrangements between the Commonwealth and the states is one where a cooperative and creative solution to the division of responsibilities between governments and the federation could very easily be agreed upon. But Prime Minister Keating is a natural centralist who trusts no-one else with power bar himself, and sometimes Bill Kelty. He could not stand the thought of the federation functioning effectively and efficiently because this would be anathema to his centralist predilections and obsessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, micro-economic reform: the government's shipping deal with the maritime unions on the ANL question is another lost opportunity for competitive reform. The cosy deal that Prime Minister Keating and the MUA came to, whereby seamen will be exempt from income tax and the Commonwealth taxpayer will provide a guarantee for the ANL shipping line, is the worst kind of mates deal. There are many other areas of micro-economic reform also where the Commonwealth lags behind: privatisation of government-owned enterprises and service delivery; postal and telecommunications competition; taxation and corporations law simplification; national competition policy&mdash;the list goes on and on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hugely irresponsible budget deficit is more than $16 billion, when accounting fiddles are allowed for. As a result of Labor's huge and grossly irresponsible drain on national savings, Commonwealth debt will have risen from $30 billion in 1990 to a whopping $95 billion next year. At this stage there is still no sign of any move by the government to alter fiscal policy so that it actually starts to reduce that menacing debt burden. So Labor has fallen into a deeply complacent malaise in which it refuses even to recognise, let alone address, this nation's major problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much that can be done to reverse Australia's declining fortunes. The coalition's recently released directional statement entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things That Matter</EMPHASIS> contains a host of initiatives and goals to achieve that. I will just mention some of them. We can boost business investment by reducing the burden and complexity of capital gains tax, the superannuation guarantee levy, fringe benefits tax and other on-costs to business; by reducing government regulation and red tape; by maintaining a stable and predictable tariff reduction regime; and by reviewing anti-dumping procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can improve our productivity by empowering employees and employers to negotiate employment contracts directly and by encouraging employees to take a stake in their workplace and in many other areas. We can create jobs by ensuring that we have a vibrant, competitive small business sector and by revitalising the process of micro-economic reform, which creates secure long-term employment in internationally competitive firms. These initiatives provide a sound and an essential underpinning to Australia's future and, because they have not been pursued, the opposition has moved this motion of urgency on the government. </PARA>

Ever since then the opposition's various frontbench spokespersons have been falling over themselves to bag Fightback and that approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the current state of the economy, we see a number of indicators&mdash;and a very broad range of indicators&mdash;that show that the economy is doing very well. I want to touch on a couple of the areas where Senator Short alleges there are particular problems. Firstly, housing activity is an important indicator of the economy. It remains around record levels. Despite a substantial increase in private dwelling approvals in August, there remains an expectation that dwelling sector activity is at or close to a peak. Pent-up housing demand is considered to be largely eroded, with current levels of building activity substantially higher than estimates of underlying demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend in private dwelling approvals increased by 2.1 per cent in August&mdash;the largest monthly increase since June 1992. In seasonally adjusted terms, private sector dwelling approvals increased by 15.4 per cent in August to reach their highest monthly level on record&mdash;and records began in January 1965. So that is one of the important indicators that things are going well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the retail trade, for example, current price retail trade data, seasonally adjusted, rose strongly in July following a marginal fall in June. I make this comment about monthly figures because I made it about a couple of the other indicators. We should always be cautious about descending to depths of gloom when one monthly set of figures trend down and reverting to a state of ecstasy when we see a significant increase in one month's figures. It is really the overall trend that is very important. Retail trade figures still remain strong and steady, and we have seen growth of seven per cent over the past 12 months in current price retail trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Westpac Melbourne institute index of consumer confidence has fallen slightly, in seasonally adjusted terms in the last three months, by 8.6 per cent&mdash;below its peak of June 1994. Despite that, the general underlying consumer sentiment is still very high by historical standards. The index is 29 per cent higher than it was in September last year and one per cent higher than the peak of the late 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various business surveys that are released indicate that business confidence has been sustained, following a June quarter that was fairly quiet in terms of business expectations. A strong improvement in output, sales, profitability and employment is anticipated in the September quarter by the National Australia Bank survey. Dun and Bradstreet report that profit expectations in the September quarter have reached their highest level in over five years. It also reports strong sales and employment expectations in the September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACCI Westpac report shows that manufacturing firms expectations for their general business outlook improved in the September quarter. The September quarter expectations for general business conditions, new orders and output all remain at or near historically high levels. The Australian Chamber of Manufacturers quarterly survey reports that manufacturers are expecting their strongest December quarter for at least the last five years. We only have to look at the headlines in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> this morning. I do not think Senator Short has read them, given his contribution to this debate. Also, motor vehicle registrations in August were at their highest level since July 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of labour force data, I again stress the importance of being cautious about month to month figures. For example, employment fell in August, only very partly unwinding the exceptionally large increase reported in July. But in seasonally adjusted terms, there has been an increase in employment of 266,000 persons compared with a year ago, and over 60 per cent of the jobs created since August 1993 have been full time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government wants these figures to continue to improve. The unemployment rate is 9.5 per cent. We will get a new figure later in the week. I have to say that on the basis of today's ANZ bank job figures, it is probably likely that unemployment will continue to trend down. Job vacancies trends have continued to rise, with both the Department of Employment, Education and Training skill vacancy series and the ANZ series rising by around two per cent in August. The latest ANZ job advertisement figures released today show that job vacancies increased by four per cent in September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say something about inflation. I am scratching to think of any good points about the way in which the Fraser government handled inflation. It never got inflation under control. But today inflation in this country remains very low. In the June quarter inflation increased by 0.7 per cent and by 1.7 per cent in the year to June. Frankly, up until five or six years ago I was one of those who had given up on ever seeing inflation figures down around one or two per cent. Today there is an expectation that the inflation figure will be very low. The norm at the moment to have a very low inflation figure. Australia's inflation figure is certainly much lower than those of our major trading partners. The level of inflation is so important in terms of costs when we compete in the international marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The June quarter 1994 national accounts show that gross domestic product increased by 0.9 per cent in the quarter, following strong growth in the December and March quarters. The underlying strength in economic activity is reflected in through the year growth to June. Quarterly activity is growing at between 4 1/4 and 4 1/2 per cent seasonally adjusted. The trend growth is close to 4.6 per cent. This is happening despite a major drought, which all the commentators acknowledge has started to and will knock about half a per cent off our growth figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the figures I have cited are good news figures. But what is the opposition's approach? The opposition, of course, picks the bad figures. It always tries to find the worst in a story. We get the same rhetoric about `cutting the deficit'. It has an ideological obsession with privatising everything and selling everything off. </PARA>

Senator Short did not tell the whole truth when he said&mdash;I think these were his words&mdash;that the seamen were exempt from income tax. That is not correct.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree with Senator Sherry that we should urge caution, but even if we urge caution we cannot deny that the figures at the moment are, in the main, looking pretty good. Inflation is low, growth, even as measured traditionally, is high and employment is rising. But the question is: for how long will this last? The current account deficit has already started to grow and interest rates are already on the rise. The National Institute for Economic Research has projected that if the government sticks to its current deficit reduction and economic strategy, we face a very high inflation, interest rates and current account blow-out by 1997, with unemployment returning to 10 per cent after that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that this government has failed to learn the lessons of the 1980s. If we are to have, even in its terms, a sustainable recovery, we need more active, imaginative and far-sighted economic policies. We need debate that includes hard and long-term decision making. But all we hear from the opposition is the mantra of `cut the deficit'. `What do we do about rising interest rates?&mdash;cut the deficit. What do we do about high unemployment?&mdash;cut the deficit. What do we do about drought in western Queensland?&mdash;cut the deficit'. How would the opposition cut the deficit to balance the budget? What $12 billion of services would it remove&mdash;health or university places? Would it eliminate unemployment benefits? How would it raise revenue? We have not heard yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the problem with this overall debate is that the government has been let off the hook. Professor Galbraith's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The culture of contentment</EMPHASIS> prevails in this country, and both the major parties embrace essentially the same core economic policies. Overseas in Europe, America and East Asia the economic policy debates have moved on to look at the creative and positive role which government can play in restructuring and rebuilding economic structures, but not here. We in this country still believe that all the answers lie in a fundamentalist view of the markets and in economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to note Vince Fitzgerald's comments last week that the Commonwealth government needs to look at reducing the deficit while maintaining a level of services that a civilised society expects and demands. That is the core question, and how will the opposition raise the revenue for that? Vince Fitzgerald commented that most of the scope for cost cutting was in the state sectors and has been achieved but that the Commonwealth has totally failed to repair its damaged revenue base. Too much speculation, too much debt, too many poor economic investment decisions are supported and encouraged by our tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened intently for creative policy alternatives from Senator Short, but nothing on his list of initiatives actually goes to the heart of repairing the Commonwealth's damaged revenue base. This very day in this place the coalition will fail to vote with the Democrats to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor for small business. So much for its support of that constituency! We support the motion but we do so in the context of our comments about the opposition's lack of a precise policy position of its own and the similarity of its approach to core economic policy to that of the government's. </PARA>

It is the blunt end that people feel around their ears when they try to pay off their homes; it is the blunt end that sends so many small businesses broke; it is the blunt end of Paul Keating's `recession we had to have' which destroyed so many people on the land. It was interest rates, a deliberate mechanism of government policy that has generated the massive unemployment, that made the recent years such a disaster for so many Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government got inflation down, at enormous cost, and it got interest rates down. But now what is happening in this economic recovery is a simple repetition of what we have seen repeatedly in the past. Interest rates are going up once again. The very instrument that destroyed so many Australians, destroyed so many small businesses, destroyed so many people's dreams is now on the way up again. That is not just a forecast, but interest rates have gone up. There are people putting their money where their judgment is, and that is in the futures market on bank bills. That judgment has already been made by people who in fact have to deal with money. Money is going to cost more&mdash;is now costing more&mdash;when we want to buy it and obtain it in future. That is the marketplace for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paul Keating says they are wrong and, of course, everyone would believe Paul Keating. With his track record of economic advice to the marketplace and to Australians, naturally everyone would believe him. He was the man who said that economic problems were just that champagne was bubbling over the glass, that there would not be a recession, and so on, that we would not have a million unemployed. The fact is that the markets are more likely to be right and have a record of being right far more than our Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that in the absence of fiscal responsibility&mdash;and I say to Senator Kernot that that means being tough on government spending, spending by governments who reckon they know how to spend our money better than the people of Australia do&mdash;this government has imposed an absurd burden on interest rate policy. In other words, if we have very slack fiscal policy we have to have very tough interest rate policy, I just wonder whether this government&mdash;and particularly whether the Treasurer&mdash;is aware that the 90-day bank bill futures market is clearly the most accurate indicator of future moves in interest rates. I do not think that the Prime Minister is aware, because the government does not seem to know anything about the real world, that the futures market, which reflects the marketplace of money over the next 18 months or so, shows interest rates rising by about four percentage points from the beginning of last month. In fact, judging by the latest prices, it is up about an extra three per cent from now, but rising to around 10 per cent in 18 months time, indicating housing interest rates of course well above that level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how realistic, for example, Senator Evans was a couple of weeks ago when he said&mdash;in fact, he stuck by a previous forecast&mdash;that any rise in interest rates that may take place over the next 18 months would only be small. That is what the government reckons&mdash;only a small rise in interest rates over the next 18 months. Yet the marketplace is already paying four per cent more, effectively, than it was at the beginning of last month for money for the future&mdash;in other words, in 18 months or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems reasonable to ask the government: why is the marketplace for money wrong in showing this blow-out in interest rates over the next 18 months? It shows that they will rise from 5.75 per cent for the 90-day bank bill rate at the beginning of last month to 9.6 per cent for December next year, 9.86 per cent for the following March and 10.06 per cent&mdash;worse than 10 per cent&mdash;for the following June. This is for the safest money there is around, namely bank bill futures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What interests me is that the government has at no stage ever provided any evidence to demonstrate that the 90-day bank bill futures market is not the most accurate indicator of future interest rate moves. It certainly compares much more favourably in terms of success rate than the government's budget forecasts or the Treasurer's&mdash;and certainly the Prime Minister's&mdash;dismal record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need from this government, if it is serious in saying that these interest rates are not going up, an unequivocal assurance that interest rates will not rise over the next 18 months by the further three per cent shown by the 90-day bank bill futures market, or does the prospect of a huge rise of another three percentage points involve a redefinition by this government of the word `small?' I would have thought a huge rise in that percentage rate would have clearly indicated a disastrous trend for those people who have to borrow money to make their businesses run or to build their homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in the face of these demands, particularly from the Reserve Bank, that there should be some tightening of fiscal policy, that the government should have a tougher budget so that so much policy burden does not rest on having to put interest rates up, it was only a little while ago that the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, in his arrogance described `all the barrackers for lower deficits'&mdash;in other words, people like the opposition, Max Walsh and a lot of other commentators as&mdash;`the, you know, failed newsletter writers and all the others that are out there still peddling their morbid tales.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the matter of urgency raised by my colleague Senator Short regarding the failure of the government to take the necessary policy action to ensure that Australia has sustainable economic and employment growth. I was somewhat bemused to hear Senator Kernot criticise the government for selling off all the family jewels by way of privatisation and so on. She also criticised the opposition for calling on the government to reduce its budget deficit. It is fascinating to read the remarks of the Governor of the Reserve Bank just prior to the ALP National Conference. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I did not hear Senator Kernot comment about that advice by the Governor of the Reserve Bank which is basically what the opposition has been saying.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does. It sounds like a pop tune or something, but it means increased taxes. The current situation in Australia is very serious. I know the Labor Party has a habit of saying, `You've never had it so good.' I remember Gough Whitlam saying that years ago when the farmers were in diabolical trouble. I suppose we can expect the government to say that. In fact, Senator Sherry said that `current economic trends'&mdash;he then regurgitated a whole lot of stuff which his minders had given to him&mdash;were `very, very good'. He said it a couple of times. `All good news' were some of the other words he used. It is all right to quote economic statistics that suit you; selective quoting is an old trick in debating. But what it means is that the people on that side&mdash;the Senator Sherrys of this world, the ministers&mdash;are not in touch with the general public. They are not talking to the ordinary people. They are not talking to those people who are looking at making private investments. That is something that should be remembered.</PARA></TALK.START>

One aspect of the matter of urgency that I would like to refer to regarding sustainable economic growth is the decision on uranium mining made at the ALP conference. I am fascinated to see that Senator Collins is in the chamber because he rated fairly big in all the debates that went on there. I think the most telling remark made about uranium by the ALP was made by Senator Ray, a man renowned for some common sense on a lot of issues. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>He is absolutely correct: you either mine it or you do not. There is nothing sacred about the three-mine policy&mdash;which, curiously, is a two-mine policy because one has fallen off. So members of the Labor Party had a debate about whether they should abandon the three-mine policy. Have honourable senators ever heard anything more ludicrous or ridiculous?

The equivalent amount of energy that we would find in 30 million tonnes of coal can be found in about 3,000 tonnes of uranium.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government to take the necessary policy action to ensure Australia has sustainable economic and employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats will support this urgency motion. However, we feel it would be fairer if the opposition was a joint target of this motion because the government would not have been able to put into effect the policies which have landed us with almost a million unemployed in Australia, unless the opposition had basically supported time and again the Australian government's economic rationalist, deregulationist policies. In fact, in the last sitting, there were no fewer than three dorothy dixers on manufacturing to enable Senator Cook and Senator Schacht to tell us about growth in manufacturing output and growth in exports of elaborately transformed manufactures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the government has not been able to boast that it has produced jobs due to the fact that it has produced jobless growth. Despite increases in manufacturing production of 13.9 per cent from the trough of the recession in June 1992, manufacturing now employs 200,000 fewer people than five years ago. In the past, manufacturing was a mass employer, employing hundreds of thousands of workers, directly and indirectly. But as a result of the government's manic obsession with internationalising the economy at reckless speed&mdash;an obsession shared by the opposition, as I have said&mdash;many of these jobs are gone. In an internationalised economy, Australia's labour-intensive industries cannot compete with the low-wage developing countries. Jobs are lost, directly, as imports from those countries displace Australian products and, indirectly, as those countries entice investment away from Australia&mdash;off-shore&mdash;to create jobs in other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic models of the government's advisers&mdash;and obviously those of the opposition's&mdash;assume that workers losing their jobs in our labour-intensive industries will somehow, and without delay, move to the new, hi-tech service industries which are purportedly to be our future. Unfortunately, the Ballarat workers who lost their jobs when Ford closed its plant did not suddenly become microchip designers in the Canberra computer industry. The sacked workers from Holeproof in Ararat have not all become tourist operators in Cairns. It is hard to see how the 140 people who have just lost their jobs with Tupperware in Ferntree Gully are suddenly going to start small businesses exporting engineering services to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to increase employment, we must innovate, research and educate. Yet Australia ranks third last among OECD countries in business expenditure on R&amp;D. Neither the government nor the coalition is prepared to increase support for venture capital, either by government or by industry. We know that the real growth in expenditure on R&amp;D has virtually been static.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the Government to take the necessary policy action to ensure Australia a sustainable economic and employment growth.</PARA>
<PARA>The greens are concerned with sustainability, but what does this mean? A lot of people have questioned whether that word has been co-opted to the point that it is useless; an obligatory filler word in any policy-related statement. However, Professor John Young made a good point that sustainability is a good word because there is no such thing as being `somewhat sustainable'. Sustainability is an absolute and could be defined from a biocentric standpoint as `a way of life sustaining the diversity and resilience of life and sustainable into the foreseeable future'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean in terms of economics and employment? It means an economic system that does not result in the degradation of life, and is one not predicated on growth of resource use, since growing resource use will always ultimately reach physical limits&mdash;and in most cases will reach the limits to what an ecosystem can bear before the physical limits are reached. An economically sustainable system must also be predicated on some measure of distributive equity. It is not sustainable for a few to continue to get richer at the expense of the many. That cannot go on forever. So `sustainable economy' must mean a system where wealth is spread around and everyone benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sustainable economic growth must therefore be very peculiar. It must be, as it was said in the Brundtland report which advocated growth, an entirely different kind of growth. It could be money growth as payment for services, for work done to existing resources. It cannot be growth based on extraction of new resources. Some people, such as Herman Daley, former World Bank economist, advocate steady state economics&mdash;and this does not mean no change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Sustainable employment growth' is another very peculiar term, one which needs to be examined carefully. We have real problems now with maldistribution of work. Some people are underemployed, some are unemployed, some are overworked, and some overwork is not paid for; it is obligatory, unpaid overtime. In this context, more work makes no sense as a solution if it means more work for those already working long hours, or simply harder work. No-one would want that. It must mean enough work for everyone. Maybe it means a better distribution of work: more for some and less for others. Maybe we should go to a 32-hour week with no overtime. Enough must also mean enough to do whatever is necessary at a rate of pay that is enough to survive on&mdash;and we are back at questions of distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, it seems to me that the policy being asked for is one where we could do more with less. It seems to me that this motion is a nonsense motion because `sustainable growth' is not a reality in ecological terms. Sustainable employment might be possible, but not linked with sustainable growth. Therefore, because this motion is such a nonsense, the Greens will be abstaining from voting on this issue. </PARA>

One proposition we cannot get over is that in terms of economic growth Australia is growing at 4 1/2 per cent per annum. By international standards, that is way above OECD averages. When we look at a whole range of other indices we see substantial improvement in the economic performance of this country as a whole. If we turn to housing we see quite dramatic improvements in the levels of construction. In retail trade we see consumer confidence and business surveys show confidence and expectations for the future. All these things point to sustained growth in our economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see is a government that is committed to a whole range of quite substantial policy objectives which, to a large measure, are being met. It is being done within the context of a social justice framework, which means that we are not looking after just a few. We are attempting to look after many and so produce a society which is much fairer, much more balanced and able to offer real and lasting prosperity to the citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government is attempting to do is to secure a rate of economic and employment growth that leads to an increase in real incomes and, by doing so, also reduces unemployment. We are seeking to improve the level of domestic savings. The superannuation policies alone of this government point in that direction. We are seeking to continue the process of creating a more innovative manufacturing nation. The economic statistics once again prove that the government is able to deliver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at improvement of the international environment for our export industries by creating new international trade arrangements.

<PARA>This report is one of a series that will deal with the media in terms of a number of topics, the first of which has been dealt with in this report and which concerns the keeping of confidentiality of sources. The committee is concerned that some journalists have gone to prison because of their conscientious belief that once they have given an undertaking, either implicitly or explicitly, to a source they would then not be entitled to reveal that source. That has come into conflict with the courts and with court-like bodies such as ICAC or the Criminal Justice Commission, which have insisted that the journalist reveal her or his source. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the committee attempted to do, and hopefully has succeeded in doing, is balance the various public interests concerned in this matter so that a fair result is obtained. A public interest was that there be a free flow of information to people in a democratic society. There was a public interest at the same time that a person who stands accused before a court should have all of the evidence that is relevant to her or his guilt before the court. Indeed, in civil matters, in matters such as an action for libel, there is a public interest in seeing that a plaintiff has available to him or her all the evidence that is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has suggested that there be a legislative change to give journalists a protection so that they do not have to reveal the source of their information but make that subject to a number of exceptions in respect of which a court will exercise its discretion to require the journalist to either reveal his or her source or do otherwise. The exceptions include things such as a person's guilt or innocence being at issue and there being an importance to know whether or not the information is true and that establishment of the truth requires the source to be known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that, if the credibility and accountability of the media were to increase, the public generally would be much more inclined to give the media privileges where it would not be so inclined to do now. To that end, the committee has recommended that the ethical conduct of the media increase. When we say `the media', we do not simply mean journalists; we mean the whole lot of the media, including journalists, editors, subeditors, owners and whoever else would be associated with publication. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee is presently set up by a section of the MEAA, which used to be the AJA, to report on new ethics for journalists. That is being chaired by Father Frank Brennan from the Society of Jesuits. It is a recommendation of this committee that, when that report is to hand, journalists adopt a new pattern for their ethical conduct, they adhere to that and at the same time they set up disciplinary measures that enforce these ethical standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that bodies like the judiciary committee of the AJA be given a legislative exemption from any action for libel that might otherwise be brought against it for the publication of its findings. In other words, what the committee recommends is that the parliament legislate to enable an effective self-regulation of the media. If that were done, it is the committee's view that people would be much more ready than they presently are to allow a journalist or any other person from the media to maintain the confidence of sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee advises that more education for journalists be made available, that a greater emphasis be placed in journalism and courses on journalism on ethics and that as many as possible of the people wanting to take on journalism do so through such courses. The committee found that, by and large, journalists are ethical in their conduct but that there have been some unhappy exceptions. It is in that context that something needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee does not support absolute privilege for journalists because of the risk that people might be found guilty if certain information were not made available in court cases. However, the committee considers that, where privilege exists for journalists not to give evidence in court about their sources, that privilege should apply equally to journalists called to appear before the ever-growing number of bodies that exercise powers that should properly be confined to royal commissions. There has been too great a growth of bodies with royal commission powers set up on a permanent basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to support Senator Cooney in presenting the report by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs of its inquiry into the rights and obligations of the media. The report is notable in that it is a unanimous report across party lines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was faced with a conflict of two principles, both of which reflect notable public interests. One is the free flow of information; the other is the need to disclose the source of information published, particularly where that is essential during the conduct of a court case. In assessing these conflicting principles, the committee arrived at a recommendation which strikes a proper balance. On the one hand, we believe in protection for journalists who on ethical grounds feel that they should not disclose a source of information they have published. On the other hand, we believe that there are and will be many situations where the disclosure of a source is essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the recommendations, we have listed a range of criteria which the court&mdash;it is for the court to decide&mdash;should take into account when making a decision about whether disclosure should be made. Perhaps foremost among those criteria is where the disclosure of a source is essential to establishing the truth of the matters published and where that in turn could materially contribute to the outcome of the court case in progress. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not propose to canvass all the details that Senator Cooney, as chairman of the committee, has already raised. I thank him for chairing this committee so ably and for eliciting information with such sensitivity&mdash;information relevant not only to this report and the many other references that have come before the committee but also to the great issues with which we as a society must grapple, such as the cost of justice, which is presently before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney's inimitable style of encouraging witnesses to relax and provide the best information has contributed much to the smooth and efficient working of the committee, as has the work of the secretariat. I join Senator Cooney in thanking them for working with us to produce not only this report but so many others. I look forward to continuing to work with Senator Cooney and Senator Ellison on the two committees which will now deal with legal matters before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs into the rights and obligations of the media was most interesting because it touches on the relationship between society and the fourth estate. Indeed, as was said during the course of the inquiry, without investigative journalism and without freedom of the press, this country would definitely have been the poorer because aspects of corruption, controversy and other matters of public interest would not have reached the notice of the community at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that is why so much importance is placed on journalists being able to protect their sources. The basic principle is that, if a journalist cannot guarantee confidentiality, people will not be forthcoming in approaching journalists and providing them with crucial information. I refer to the case of Tony Barrass, a journalist from my home state of Western Australia, who was gaoled for seven days for refusing to reveal his source during a petty sessions trial. That was a most dramatic illustration of the law coming into conflict with the journalistic ethic of protecting one's source&mdash;and that is why this was a most important reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been other more recent examples, occurring not only before courts but also bodies of inquiry such as ICAC. There was the case of Deborah Cornwall, who appeared before such a body. In the end, she was given a suspended sentence and ordered to do community service work for not revealing her source. So, at the outset, the committee realised that this was a most important aspect of a democratic society&mdash;that the freedom of the press not be interfered with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, balanced against that is the question of the administration of justice. That, too, is a very high ideal and an essential principle of any democratic society. In looking at the question of whether journalists should be afforded some sort of privilege, we had to look at the question of justice. The committee came upon a recommendation which, I think, strikes a reasonable balance in the circumstances. This allows a limited protection and reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends enactment of amendments to the Evidence Acts (Commonwealth and State) to provide that a journalist who has received information from a source on a confidential basis which is subsequently published will not necessarily be compelled to answer questions relating to the identity of that source. The court could, of its own motion or on the application of a party, and having considered each of the factors listed below, order the journalist to answer questions relating to the source's identity on the basis that the public interest in the administration of justice in that particular case outweighs the public interest in maintaining the confidentiality of the source.</PARA>
<PARA>That is perhaps the nub of the recommendation. The committee went on to recommend various factors that should be taken into account: whether the evidence of the source is essential to the issue of the case&mdash;for instance, the guilt or innocence of the person accused of the crime; whether the maintaining of confidence would result in concealing criminal activity; and whether the witness has been given an opportunity to contact the source in order to seek a waiver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other factors have to be considered, but I will not go into them here. Suffice to say that they are reasonable and cogent considerations in the administration of justice. I believe that the committee has achieved a sensible balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also considered the question of accountability of the journalistic profession. If this privilege is to be afforded to journalists in the course of a hearing it would place them in a privileged class of persons. Not every citizen can go before a court, refuse to answer a question and be allowed to do so on lawful grounds. That is something that would normally attract an action for contempt. It would be placing journalists in the league of, perhaps, lawyers, priests and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee quite sensibly tied together the aspect of the shield law for journalists' confidential sources with the accountability of that profession. I believe that, if a journalist is guilty of gross unethical behaviour such as inventing a source or, as one journalist mentioned today, of conducting an interview with his typewriter, we have a most serious situation on our hands. The community cannot let that go without check. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where the Press Council and the MEAA need some sanction which can be applicable to the profession. The committee recommended that the Press Council be given power to impose and enforce sanctions on the print media. This should be done by legislation if necessary. That does not mean that the Press Council should become a body run by the government to control the press; it is nothing of the sort. This would allow self-regulation and, if a journalist did have an interview with his or her own typewriter and invented a source, a sanction could be applied. As the old saying goes: of the person to whom much is given much is expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one gives a right to a person, a reciprocal duty is expected. If we give a person the right not to answer a question in a court of law, that person has a duty to use that right responsibly. Lawyers have those rights and they are accountable. Lawyers can face a number of penalties from bodies which regulate their behaviour&mdash;the most draconian being the striking off of that lawyer so that he cannot practise law again. If journalists are to be given this sort of protection, there must be some accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that that accountability should interfere with the freedom of the press, because that would be the last thing that anyone would want. The freedom of the press is essential to the good running of society as we know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to Senator Cooney for the work that he has done as chairman of this committee. As Senator Spindler said, Senator Cooney is well known for the manner in which he conducts meetings and for his graciousness to witnesses which results in the committee getting to the bottom of issues. I also thank my colleagues from the coalition for their input. I thank Senator Spindler for his work in relation to this reference and the other references that have been before this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a unanimous report. It is a report which will stand in good stead for the future and will assist the government of the day in looking at how to approach this very complex and difficult problem. The report is detailed and comprehensive. That is due in no small way to the efforts of the secretariat to the committee. The secretariat did a most thorough job. I hope that we can come up with as comprehensive and cogent a report when we deal with the next terms of reference in relation to the media. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to speak for only a few minutes to endorse the remarks made by Senator Spindler and Senator Ellison about the chairman of this committee, Senator Cooney. The previous speakers, including Senator Cooney, have adequately addressed the contents of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am motivated to speak today because this will be the last report of this type presented by the Legislative and General Purpose Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The standing orders of the Senate have been changed to divide the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee into two separate committees. The revamped committee which would deal with references of this nature will be chaired by a member of the opposition. Consequently, Senator Cooney will lose his place as chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to endorse what Senator Ellison said about the way that Senator Cooney conducts inquiries such as this. He has a style that is peculiar to him. When we examine it, we would not think it would work in a fit, but on each and every occasion it does work and he manages to get the best out of each and every witness. Those witnesses sometimes express diverse and contrary views; yet they are appearing at the table and making their responses, and everybody goes away happy, and the parliament and the people of Australia benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without reflecting on the decision of the Senate to revamp the committee system, I believe that we have lost something in losing Senator Cooney as chairman of this committee. Today, however, he was elected chair of the Legal and Constitutional References Committee so we will still see his style for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee is one of the busiest committees of this chamber. A lot of bills are referred to us and we have a lot of ongoing references. It is a tribute to Senator Cooney that, despite the enormous amount of work that he does with this committee, his other committee work, and his constituency work, he has been able to continue to force this committee into concluding the references at hand and fulfilling the committee's obligations to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although this sounds somewhat like a valedictory speech, it is not meant to be so. When I say that Senator Cooney has made an enormous contribution to the work of the Senate committee system and to the Senate, I mean it in the truest sense of the word. Unfortunately, on these types of future references, we are going to lose him. He will continue as a member of the committee and I am sure that his inimitable style of questioning will continue to benefit the committee, its references and, indeed, the Senate as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994, Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 Farm Household Support Act 1992, Fisheries Administration Act 1991, Fisheries Management Act 1991, National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, Wheat Marketing Act 1989, Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993, Wool Tax Act (No. 3) 1964 and The Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987,. In addition there are several acts that require minor amendment relating to the change of name of the `Australian Agricultural Council' to the `Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Act 1994 are technical amendments to ensure that the national registration authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals can require a chemical company to provide certain information. The information would concern the reconsideration of chemical product registration and decisions concerning the suspension or cancellation of permits and chemical products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, this information when provided by a chemical company will be recognised as protected registration information. This will ensure that information provided to the national registration authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals will not be commercially exploited by others without due regard to the payment of compensation to the originator of the information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 concern levy payers to the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small winemakers often forward grapes to another, usually larger, winemaker who converts the material into wine under instructions for a fee (`toll processing'). The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker for him or her to market. The smaller winemaker owns the wine throughout the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is the `producer' and is liable for levy on the wine. This cost is usually added to the fee charged to the smaller winemaker. The smaller winemaker is therefore the effective, but not the official levy payer and accordingly is not entitled to attend, debate or vote in the industry annual general meeting of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed will permit small winemakers who `toll process' to pay levy directly and to accept the rights and obligations of levy payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By redefining `producer' for the purposes of the wine grapes levy under the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 and replacing the term `winemaker' with `producer' in part IVB of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980, which relates to annual general meetings of the industry, small winemakers will become the official levy payers in their own right and will be able to represent their own interests to the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments to the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Act 1993 are for two main purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly they will ensure that ecologically sustainable development principles are written into the charter of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation and that the membership of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation board will include, in future, expertise in environmental and ecological matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation will therefore need to take ecologically sustainable development principles into account in its corporate planning, annual reporting and in determining priorities for allocation of research and development funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision is now a feature of all research and development statutory authorities in this portfolio and is in accordance with government policy on ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly they will provide for the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation to allocate funds received from patents or trademarks associated with non-research and development activities to other than research and development. Currently all funds received from patents and trademarks must be paid into the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation's wool research and development fund. The most significant of these non-research and development activities will be the revenue from the commercialisation of the woolmark. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992, implement a range of measures to improve the delivery of farm household support to farmers experiencing financial difficulties and to improve the administration of farm household support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Farmers applying for farm household support will have a longer period to provide proof that they are unable to access further commercial finance. If farm household support recipients are dissatisfied with a decision in relation to the extension of their grant periods, they will have improved mechanisms to seek a review of such decisions. This will complement the current mechanism of an appeal direct to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments also allow for improved administration of farm household support by providing a power for the secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and energy to delegate his or her powers under the act. To assist with management of the loan portfolio, and ensure that all eligible recipients receive the benefit of the conversion of nine months of their farm household support payments to a grant, all farm household support recipients will be required to notify the secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy of certain changes in their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is currently no provision in the Farm Household Support Act 1992 to prevent a person who has received a lump sum farm household support payment upon the sale of their farm, from receiving farm household support at a later stage and again selling a farm and receiving another such payment. These amendments ensure that a person may only receive one such payment. This will ensure that the funds available for this purpose are directed equitably to those who are committed to re-establishing their families outside of the farm sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report on the adequacy of fisheries legislation, presented by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure in December 1993, recommended a number of amendments to fisheries legislation. A majority of the recommended changes will improve the operation of the legislation and it is opportune to include the technical amendments in this bill. During the inquiry, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority identified some further technical amendments to improve the effectiveness of the legislation. These have also been included in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Technical amendments are proposed to the Fisheries Administration Act 1991 to clarify the sources of funds available to Australian Fisheries Management Authority. Another amendment recognises the amalgamation of the ministerial council responsible for fisheries and forestry. The amalgamation results from the decision of the council of Australian governments to reduce the number of ministerial councils. The amendments that are proposed to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 will allow fishing permit holders greater flexibility in nominating the boat to be used with that permit. In addition, this bill clarifies the emergency powers available to the Australian Fisheries Management Authority to manage fisheries and some powers and obligations of fisheries officers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 is amended to eliminate an anomaly in funding arrangements for the Fisheries Research and Development Corporation. The amended provision will ensure that research contributions from state-licensed fishermen which are paid either directly to the corporation or to consolidated revenue can be matched by the Commonwealth as originally intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the National Residue Survey Administration Act 1992, which were originally at the request of the cattle industry, will broaden the scope of the survey to encompass animal feeds and fibre products. This will enable industries to have a wider picture of likely contaminants in the food chain, and lead to earlier intervention if contaminants are detected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be supplemented by the National Residue Survey having the facilities, at industries instigation, to fund educational and extension programs from the National Residue Survey's account. This will lead to a more efficient survey and give industry a stronger role in ensuring that its commodity is, indeed, `clean and green', and far more competitive on domestic and international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 extends the definition of `grain'. The amendment is necessary following the transfer to the Australian Wheat Board of the seed testing facilities of the Victorian Department of Agriculture. The transfer is beneficial to, and is supported by the grains and seeds industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new definition of `grain' extends the coverage from the common cereal grains to horticultural, pasture and tree seeds, but only for the purposes of seed testing and seed certification. The Australian Wheat Board will not be able to use its marketing and trading powers for horticultural, pasture and tree seeds as it does not wish to undertake such activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is also being amended to allow for regulations to be made which impose a penalty not exceeding the current equivalent of $1000. It is intended that such a penalty will be applied by proposed regulations which will make it mandatory (rather than voluntary as at present) for wheat levy payers and collectors to provide certain information concerning the levy payment. The information is used for the management of the Wheat Industry Fund and the allocation to individual levy payers of equity in the fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An administrative amendment to the act will remove the 65 years age limit restriction on persons appointed to the board of the Australian Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the following amendments included in this bill are of a procedural nature directed to improving the administration of the issues dealt with in those acts. The amendment to the Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Act 1993 corrects an error in a date. The amendments to the Wool Tax Act (No. 3) 1964 are of a procedural nature and remove all references to `registered' from the title of wool dealers because such a reference is now obsolete. The amendment to the definition of sugar industry organisations contained in the Sugar Cane Levy Act 1987 is necessary following the consolidation of the sugar industry organisations currently listed within Industries Research (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Act 1985, Rural Industries Research Act 1985, Pig Industry Act 1986, Horticultural Policy Council Act 1987, Exotic Animal Disease Control Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Council Act 1991 result from the amalgamation of the former ministerial councils that dealt with agriculture, water resources, soil conservation and rural adjustment issues into the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand. Of these pre-existing ministerial councils, the Australian Agricultural Council was referred to in these acts. It is necessary, therefore, that these acts be amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WINE GRAPES LEVY AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to revise the arrangements for levies paid under the Wine Grapes Levy Act 1979 (as amended) (`the act'). The government is making these changes at the request of the winemaking industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act imposes a levy on winemakers. The `marketing component' of the levy funds the operations of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation (the corporation). The corporation's statutory responsibilities include wine promotion, wine export control, the wine label integrity program and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `research component' of the levy supports the operations of the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. This corporation has the statutory responsibility to co-ordinate and fund research and development undertaken on behalf of the grape and wine industry. The government provides matching funding for research and development expenditure on a dollar for dollar basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worthwhile noting that to date levy rates have been set and altered at the request of industry. I do not anticipate that this will change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the legislation specifies a complex range of levy rates for the marketing component. This makes for an unwieldy process when changing the levy rates for the marketing component. The bill instead provides that the levy rates will be set out in regulations, as is the usual case for horticultural levies. This will facilitate execution of industry requests to change the levy and bring it into line with normal practice. At the same time a maximum amount (0.5% of the gross value of production) is set for the marketing component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act already provides that the levy rates for the research component be specified by regulation. The research levy rate is at present $1.90 per tonne and the legislation sets a limit of $2 per tonne for this levy. The maximum was set in the original act of 1979 and needs to be raised to $3 per tonne to enable the industry to increase its funding of industry research and development, if it so desires.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also ends the exemption that smaller winemakers (those processing less than 10 tonnes of product) had from paying levy. As non-payers, those winemakers have no representation in the decisions and operations of the corporation and its regulatory functions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that these winemakers will pay the small annual fee that constitutes the minimum levy rate, in return for which they will have the right to represent their interests at annual general meetings of the corporation and to receive the services and information that the corporation provides to its levy payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that the corporation's role is of considerable importance in the Australian wine industry's drive to reach an annual export level of $1 billion by the year 2000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many small producers will not be exporters, but the changes in the domestic market directly affect them. Such changes include the effects of expanded trade on grape supplies and Australia's commitment to end the use of European geographical indications in labelling our wine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that the small winemakers not be left out of consideration in the strategic development of the Australian wine industry. It is important that their voice be heard. Their present ineligibility to be members of the AWBC prevents them from having the opportunity. The bill is intended to redress this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEVIES AND CHARGES (WINE GRAPES) COLLECTION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 (the `Collection Act') to allow small wine producers to pay levy in their own right and represent themselves at annual general meetings of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small winemakers often forward grapes to another, usually larger, winemaker who converts the material into wine under instructions for a fee (`toll processing'). The wine is then returned to the smaller winemaker for him or her to market. The smaller winemaker owns the wine throughout the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current legislation, the larger winemaker is the `producer' and is liable for levy on the wine. This cost is usually added to the fee charged to the smaller winemaker. The smaller winemaker is therefore the effective, but not the official levy payer and accordingly is not entitled to attend, debate or vote in the industry annual general meeting of the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed will permit small winemakers who `toll process' to pay levy directly and to accept the rights and obligations of levy payers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the legislation will allow small winemakers who have their wines toll processed to be recognised as the official levy payers, the government has put forward the related Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 to ensure that product from small winemakers is leviable product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By redefining `producer' for the purposes of the wine grapes levy under the Collection Act, small winemakers will become the official levy payers in their own right and will be able to represent their own interests to the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL RESIDUE SURVEY ADMINISTRATION (MEAT CHICKEN) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, provides for an increase in the maximum rate of levy under the national residue survey for meat chickens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase has been requested by the peak industry body, the Australian Chicken Meat Federation, in order to maintain flexibility for changes to the survey programs required for the chicken meat industry in the coming years.</PARA>

<PARA>Honourable senators will recall an order adopted by the Senate on 28 June requiring each minister in the Senate in respect of each department administered by that minister or by a minister in the House of Representatives to table, not later than 10 October 1994, an indexed list of the titles of all relevant files, including new parts of existing files created between 1 January and 30 June 1994 in the central office of that department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The order of the Senate of 28 June went on to detail when further lists of files would be so provided and their definition, including files relating to the policy advising functions of departments, including any relating to the development of legislation and other matters of public administration `but need not include. . .

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you and other honourable senators will recall that this order arose out of a motion that I had on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for perhaps a year or so prior to that time. I cannot remember the actual time but certainly last year I put in a notice of motion for the submission by ministers of file lists so that we could exercise more readily our functions as members of this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 March, Senator Gareth Evans took into account my concerns about this issue. I wish to quote to the Senate the formal, unequivocal undertaking given by Senator Evans on 3 March as part of the accountability package to which the government had agreed. The undertaking is in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, we will support, subject to further discussion on detailed drafting, motion No 544, notice of which was given by Senator Harradine on 16 December 1993. That motion would require publication by way of tabling in parliament of departmental file titles relating to policy matters, legislation and the like.</PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, discussions were held between Senator Evans's office and my office and an agreement was reached as to the specific terms of the order. That agreement having been reached, I amended my motion to take account specifically of that agreement. The Senate subsequently adopted that wording and an addendum by Senator Vanstone, and Senator Vanstone's addendum was contained in paragraphs 2 and 3 of the motion adopted on 28 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That addendum, in effect, was that paragraph one, the operative paragraph of the order, should not take effect until the earlier of the following: 1 September 1994, or the day the Senate by resolution adopts a recommendation of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that that paragraph, or that paragraph as amended, is to take effect on and from a specified day. In connection with that resolution certain matters were referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was given to understand by Senator Vanstone that the addendum was designed to have the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration examine not whether relevant departmental files were to be produced, but how they could be more effectively produced in a user-friendly manner. Subsequently, the committee did consider the matter. It received a submission from the government prepared by departments and came up with a recommendation that the order be revoked; that a trial not involve any retrospectivity and exclude appropriate classes of confidential files as suggested by the committee; and that the government give notice of any appropriate substitute motion which would implement a trial production of indexed lists of departmental files for two departments for six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment that I am moving indicates that the order of the Senate of 28 June will now take affect from 10 November. In effect, it is an amendment which opposes the revocation of that order, but it does recognise the fact that today was the day on which the ministers were required by the order to table the file lists. For one reason or another, the departments were not prepared&mdash;and probably could not be expected to be prepared&mdash;to meet today's deadline, given the fact that the order was referred to the committee and the committee made the recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to that, my amendment to the motion gives a leeway of another month for the departments to provide the list of file titles. The second part of my amendment simply omits paragraphs (2) and (3) of the order as amended. They have run their course, in any event, and there is no intrinsic value in retaining them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The issue of defence exports is essentially a moral and social one. It is an issue of taking responsibility. As John Kerin said when he was Chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee and was kicking off the inquiry into this issue, `The immense expenditure on loss of life, on equipping ourselves to kill and destroy and on defending ourselves from others so equipped is horrific.' It is a horrible thing that our best technical efforts&mdash;the genius of humanity&mdash;seem to be used first and mainly for the purpose of developing new threats to life and to each other. It has been estimated in the past that over half the scientists currently working are working for the war industry. That may be a few years out-of-date, but I do not imagine things have changed too much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attempt to regulate this industry in such a way as to be certain we send weapons only to `approved armies' is a moral question. It is a question of social ethics and responsibility. What armies will be approved and why? Which ones will not be approved, and why not? What does that mean? When we approve, what are we approving? Whose pain, death and maiming are we saying is a justified result?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a second question. Australia, through its government, actively encourages defence exports. We subsidise the stuff. There is a question in this inquiry, included for industry's benefit, as to how well we are promoting these exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In regard to the first point&mdash;that arms dealing is an ethical issue&mdash;I did not see much cause for optimism about Australia taking a principled, moral role. We seem to be happy to sell to almost anyone&mdash;basically, to anyone on whom the United Nations has not imposed sanctions. We are certainly not leaders here. During the inquiry, we saw the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) actively promote the sale of arms to Indonesia and Thailand. At the time Indonesia was, and still is, a nation that the United States refused to sell arms to on the grounds that it was likely they would be used in human rights violations, particularly in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thailand has a history of suppression of minority groups, forced village relocation schemes and support for the Khmer Rouge, although that support may be at a lower level than official government policy. The latter emphasises a further point about Thailand: it has a military which is very politically active and which seems to be made up of fairly autonomous factions, not always under central government control. It has a history of coups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indonesia has, essentially, a military government which has been involved in the invasion of other nations, repression of protest over such action at a level described as `massacres', repression of the press for criticism of government incompetence and corruption, repression of political opposition and repression of unions. It is a nation with immense wealth concentrated in a few hands&mdash;basically, the hands of those in government or their families. Ordinary people are often forced by poverty to work for 80c or 90c per day, roughly half the official minimum wage of about $1.80 per day. These are governments we see as very good candidates for our military exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second issue&mdash;the promotion of military exports&mdash;I felt repelled by the feeling that was prevalent: that facilitating such promotion was the real job of the committee. Yet I did take some hope in the fact that, despite all the effort and money poured into this industry and despite the moves to free up the export process advocated in earlier inquiries, defence exports have declined. They have declined rapidly. The export push is a failure. What concerns me is that there is little recognition of this, and `the light at the end of the tunnel' mentality persists. We will probably see even more schemes to promote military exports. The evidence is now in, however, to show that this is economically irresponsible, and the light in the tunnel is liable to be an oncoming train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry, a certain amount of dust was thrown up about what exactly a defence export is. There was a lot of talk about ambulances, socks and blankets. There are views that say that even though those things are not deadly in themselves, such exports actively assist an army to do whatever it is doing, so these exports should be stopped whenever an army is acting in a way that we do not wish to support. I would agree with this. While these views are important considerations which get little attention, currently none of these things is a regulated export&mdash;except in circumstances such as with Iraq, where we have to make special cases or fall outside international sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, we do not consider these things at all. Most talk about these things was a smokescreen put up to make it look as though the defence goods which Australia exports may be harmless. We may export these things, but they are not regulated and no information is available. The goods we do make that we regulate are guns, ammunition, fragmentation grenades, the odd frigate or patrol boat, components of advanced weapon systems and command and control systems. We also export a certain amount of surplus equipment&mdash;the occasional Mirage jet or Iroquois helicopter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be clear. When we talk about defence exports, we are mainly talking about things that kill people or are part of a thing or system to kill people. Extending the definition is a good idea, but any discussion of what is going on does not include this. What is going on is horrific. We are supposed to prevent exports that stir up conflict where there are current traditional tensions between nations. So we sell Mirage jets to Pakistan! We sell them as spare parts and, according to Graham Cheeseman of the Defence Academy, we sell at 20 per cent of their value. But they work, and Pakistan has them in the air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason to mention the tension between Pakistan and India here. Everyone here should know of it. It has been common knowledge for a good 40 years. Last month former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced Pakistan had built nuclear weapons, prompting a deployment of conventional and unconventional weapons by India, another nuclear weapon state. The Secretary-General of the United Nations, Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali, had to rush over there to try to pacify things. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have regulations designed to stop human rights violations. That did not stop the proposal to export fragmentation grenades or 750mm ammunition to Sri Lanka, engaged in what amounts to race-based civil war. These exports were stopped but by public outcry at the evident intent to export in spite of regulations. We see everywhere an attempt to promote defence exports and cooperation with regimes known for their civil and human rights violations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that this is the best way to influence them&mdash;by keeping diplomatic channels open. This is exactly the logic used by those who kept dealing with Hitler through the rise of the Nazis and the invasion of Austria, until the invasion of Poland. Indonesia invaded Timor. It moved populations around to try to undermine the local people, exactly as China did with Tibet. Indonesia has subsequently periodically massacred Timorese who resist or protest the occupation of their land. We play three monkeys and do nothing. Not only is our voice silent internationally while we decry the aggression against Kuwait, but we actively assist the Indonesian army. We are happy to train its members. The Minister for Defence talks about selling it weapons. We are happy to do all sorts of things the United States has said it will not do because of human rights implications. We are happy to ignore those implications and the human rights of people in Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had some talk of moral stand about refusing to interfere in the so-called domestic affairs of Indonesia&mdash;East Timor, East Papua, the closure of journals, the suppression of unions fighting for at least the minimum wage of $1.80 per day, and the imprisonment of union leaders for decades. At the same time we feel totally happy to assist Papua New Guinea in suppressing the people of Bougainville who are trying to be free of a government that ignores social, economic and ecological devastation by so-called `Australian' transnational mining companies. Australia has an interest in assuring Bougainville is safe for exploiters with `Australian' identities. Again, we do not just morally sanction; we actively assist. We train troops and police forces. We arm them. We give them helicopters and say, `We didn't know, what can we do?' when those helicopters are rearmed as gunships. What did we think would happen?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we agree that defence exports are declining, we are extremely wary of the whittling away by Defence of what it considers real defence exports. We note that in table 2.1, $187 million of `export approval' is cut down to $17 million of what is called real exports. Only $27 million of that is related to approvals given which have not yet resulted in exports. Thirty million dollars is exports of `sporting goods', not considered real by defence. Thirty million dollars is double the $17 million defence thinks is real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they are regarded as `sporting goods', let us look at what they comprise. In 1992-93, when sporting goods were only $8.2 million, they included $717,000 worth of guns for Singapore. That is a lot of new guns in a year for a city state with tough gun laws. Who is shooting what for fun? Do they have skeet ranges on the rooftops? Are all these really for the police? Or are they simply guns not for the military to be sold perhaps to someone from out of state&mdash;a traveller from Cambodia or the golden triangle. The fourth biggest buyer of sporting guns was Cyprus. Is there good hunting in Cyprus! New Caledonia and Namibia were in the top 10, and Papua New Guinea was number 11. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to sporting ammunition, Kuwait bought $351,000 worth; Bangladesh bought $173,000 worth. They do a lot of duck hunting in Bangladesh. Papua New Guinea bought $108,000 worth, and this was in a year when less than $10 million in sporting weapons was sold. I wonder what sort of end-user certificate they had and how much consideration the applications received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the Mirage jets did not get much of a look-in. Perhaps defence did not consider it a real export. Then again, we had the Steyr rifle deal. Defence did not consider the two sample lots of 50 guns each as needing any consideration. They were just samples in a bid for a $300 million order. The order was not considered. There was no export application for the whole deal, even in principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two new committees mentioned in the main report on page 46 to consider broader policy issues and consider applications at an early stage did not consider this proposal. No-one considered it. But the Minister for Defence was happy to promote it and when the public became concerned and the concerns resulted in a reaction in Thailand, the Minister for Trade was happy to go over there and calm things down and put in his word for the sales. Where is the consideration here? Where is the disinterested judge?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the moral hypocrisy involved in putting troops out to defend oil wells in Kuwait, which we may end up doing again, while ignoring the invasion of Timor, Grenada or covert warfare against Nicaragua, or the genocidal wars in Bhutan against the Gorkas, in India against the Nagas, in Turkey against the Kurds, in China against the Tibetans. Aside from this, there is the question of helping the build-up and transformation of militaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This support of military build-up and transformation is the cornerstone of our export policy, particularly in the ASEAN region. The build-up in ASEAN is the cornerstone of nearly every exporter's policy. We are told that there is no build-up since little more money is being spent, but Thailand is getting an aircraft carrier, Malaysia is getting 18 MIG-29s, Indonesia has bought 39 E German warships, ordered three submarines, 24 British Hawk fighters and other weapons in the last year. Its budget was increased by 24 per cent. It is getting them cheap or, in the case of Malaysia, trading MIGs from Russia for palm oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the famous peace dividend&mdash;the massive availability of inexpensive surplus weapons, the push for exports by all manufacturers as they try to survive in the face of a decline in superpower buying. In ASEAN it is less a build-up in the classic sense than a transformation as military forces in the area go from basic forces prepared to fight a defensive ground war to more strategic forces capable of hitting over long distances at population centres.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As countries like Thailand are getting an aircraft carrier, the classic response is submarines. The response to submarines is detection and anti-submarine weaponry. The response to aircraft is aircraft missiles, detection and so on. It is a raising of the technological stakes and the likelihood that civilian population centres are targeted. It is a vast increase in what defence people call projection capability, the ability to strike over long distances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This transformation is occurring and is modernisation in a different sense from replacing an old rifle with a new one. It is the sort of thing that creates fear, insecurity and demands a response. This is where we are targeting our weapons sales. We have put three defence trade commissioners into Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia to do so at the approximate cost of $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not doing anything here for peace or security. We are actively working against it. We are doing the sorts of things that everyone reading Senator Gareth Evans's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cooperating for Peace</EMPHASIS> would conclude are among the least productive or most counterproductive things a nation wanting peace could do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation also emphasises the fact that it is a buyers' market. Everyone is trying to sell here. ASEAN is a small market, and economically there has not been a lot of money spent on arms compared with what we ourselves spend. The ASEAN defence market in total is only about the size of the Australian defence market. It is a tiny market and everyone is trying to sell into it. It is little wonder human rights and any other consideration which might lead us to hesitate gets short shrift. It also makes the prospect of a massive and expanding defence export market on our doorstep fairly ridiculous. The only reason we look to it is that when we look elsewhere we see defence exports collapsing in a heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to face the fact that in economic terms the defence industry is a basket case. As with most markets, this is not universally true. There are some competitive producers. But this is one area the push for market rationalism never reached. We see the government pouring money into the Australian Defence Industries. In 1992-93 $366 million was poured into this to convert loans to equity. This is in a government owned company where the government already had 100 per cent of equity. It was simply a subsidy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> That year the government also gave $162 million to ASTA, the former Government Aircraft Factories, now Aerospace Technologies of Australia. There are also the subsidies through purchase policies designed to support these industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main report notes specifically that sale to the Australian defence forces or the ADF is a good selling point for exports. The prime reason we hear for the support and subsidy of an export defence industry is that we need to get it off the ground. There is no evidence that it will ever get off the ground in the commercial sense spoken of. The reason we are given that it must get off the ground is that exports are needed to make our domestic industries competitive. Domestic demand alone is not sufficient to justify domestic production at normal competitive levels, we are told. There is evidence that we will never get enough of a market in ASEAN to make them competitive, and other markets are collapsing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we must have domestic industries, we are told, is that we need to be self-reliant. We are not self-reliant in any sense that involves self-sufficiency. We currently import much of our equipment. We look like continuing that way unless the defence industry here undergoes a huge expansion. If self-sufficiency is the root principle that leads inevitably to the conclusion that we need a dramatically expanding export defence industry, then we need to re-examine that principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Woodman noted that in the history of the policy of defence self-reliance the original definition meant having the ability to maintain, repair and modify our defence equipment. It did not mean building our own submarines or frigates, and then trying to flog submarines and frigates around the place to pay for the shipyards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Woodman's proposal was that there are real problems with our current policy. He suggested that we need to reassess what we are doing in the light of the original goals of self-reliance. This would hopefully result in abandoning our mad push for defence exports. These exports are not major economic contributors. They are not employers. Defence exports are a small share of total exports. They are a declining share. It is time to give up promoting these and end the duality that leads to lack of regulation and the subsidies that cost the taxpayer so much. This would result in a far better result in terms of our foreign policy objectives and our international credibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the comments that I have just made, it would seem obvious why it was felt necessary by me and five other members of the full foreign affairs, defence and trade subcommittee to include a report which we called an additional report. It was additional because in terms of the terms of reference we felt that whole sections were not fully considered, in particular, the strategic, political, economic, international and human rights implications of defence exports. Therefore, whilst some aspects of the full committee report may include the legitimate concerns of the majority of the committee, without fully considering the information in the additional report, a reader might well get the impression that all was well with a policy of promoting defence exports as a positive thing for the economy, for Australia and for the region. I do not believe it is so and I would like to say that I am very pleased that other members and senators have supported the additional report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;In speaking on this report, I should say that I am one of the people who signed the additional report. Along with everyone else who signed the additional report, I agree with the recommendations of the majority report, but we have a basic problem that we do not believe they go far enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report is based on an assumption that the arguments against a liberal defence exports regime are largely or solely moral. That is not the case. Ill-judged export approvals can cause real and measurable hardship, in contravention of human rights guarantees under international law to which Australia is a signatory. They can also undermine other foreign policy goals by alienating a significant section of an importing nation or a rival country. There are pragmatic reasons to favour a more restrictive approvals regime, and these have not been adequately explored in the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just a theoretical concern. Some exports or export approvals under the liberal post-1988 regime have had precisely those effects. Prime examples of poor decisions made under that regime do exist. The report deals cursorily with three, involving Pakistan, Burma and Iraq, acknowledging the public controversy caused within Australia but ignoring negative foreign policy implications. What are those? The 1990 decision to approve the sale of 36 Mirage fighters to Pakistan caused major difficulties in Australia's relationship with India and raised serious nuclear proliferation concerns. Pakistan is widely thought to have a nuclear weapons program and it has a long-standing dispute with India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mirages could themselves deliver nuclear weapons or provide air support for a nuclear strike by Pakistan's front-line F-16 aircraft. The 1990 and 1991 decisions to permit the export of trainer aircraft parts to Iraq and Burma respectively sent inappropriate signals to regimes which really, everybody would have to say, have a dreadful human rights record. Indeed, the Iraqi air force had in 1988 dropped chemical weapons on Kurdish civilians killing up to 5000 of them. The export approval was withdrawn only following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other inappropriate export approvals are not dealt with at all in the majority report. It really should have explained how these breaches of good judgment occurred and why they believe that similar errors will not be made in the future. For example, in 1989-90, approval was granted to export Strikemaster trainer aircraft worth $4.87 million to Somalia. The export did not proceed only for commercial reasons. Somalia had been gripped by civil war for years and Amnesty International had documented numerous atrocities by government forces in that country. The Somalian air force had a counter-insurgency squadron which, by definition, was for internal use only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian military equipment and training have contributed to human rights abuses on Bougainville, by both the Papua-New Guinea Defence Force and the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. The government's drive to boost defence exports to Asia has the potential to raise further human rights and foreign policy questions, but it is not adequately analysed in the majority report. At least two developments warrant further analysis. The bid to sell Steyr rifles to Thailand carries the risk that some will be on-sold by Thai army personnel&mdash;we are not saying it is the Thai government doing it but the army personnel are very well known for this sort of thing&mdash;and smuggled to the Khmer Rouge or across the Burmese border to the SLORC and the Burmese army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is apparently a view within DFAT that this is a real possibility. As ever in such cases, it will be argued that Australia faces competition from other countries. If we do not supply them, someone else will. That is true, but it fails to take into account the international and domestic damage to Australia's reputation&mdash;if we do not want to look at anything else&mdash;if, for example, it is shown that the Khmer Rouge has obtained and is using Australian made rifles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plan to co-produce weapons with Indonesia again could implicate Australia in counter-insurgency operations in East Timor, in Irian Jaya and in Aceh, amongst other places. Co-production will presumably involve export approvals in at least some cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority report should have assessed the future of security cooperation in the Asia-Pacific, and asked whether rising arms exports to the region might compromise or hinder Australian efforts to improve the regional security environment. It seems unarguable that arms control will feature in the regional security discourse at some time in the future, and it also seems clear that it is in Australia's security interests for that to happen. Remaining a minor or minimal arms supplier to the region offers greater scope to push that agenda without damaging domestic commercial interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the report should have examined whether the current export drive has taken sufficient account of a possible future trend towards military spending restraint and the claiming of a peace dividend in regional countries with pressing non-military investment needs. Given the very low and declining level of exports from Australia, it is both too late and potentially counterproductive to keep trying to board a bandwagon which may well break down in the reasonably near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scepticism of the view that regional arms control could become a prominent issue should be tempered by the recollection that any form of regional security dialogue, as has begun in the ASEAN Regional Forum, was considered unthinkable only a few years ago. Those of us who signed the additional report believe that the defence export controls should be strengthened, with greater weight being given to the protection of human rights, the avoidance of adverse foreign policy impacts and the need to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of Australia's arms control and regional security diplomacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report's discussion of services touches on the question of government to government exports&mdash;for example training&mdash;but it does not explore that issue further. It seems obvious that government to government exports of services should be subject to the same approval process as now applies to hardware exports, and which the report recommends could be extended to exports of services by the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also agree with the view put to the committee by Amnesty International, which recommends that defence export controls be extended to, or replicated for, law enforcement equipment and animal control equipment which is sometimes used for torture. This would have the obvious and desirable impact of reducing the risk that Australian exports could contribute to human rights abuses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our defence exports regime should be based fairly and squarely on Australia's foreign policy objectives, including, in particular, increasing the observance of human rights around the world. That is something which it does not do at the moment. While the current guidelines are a distinct improvement on what we have had in the past, they do not fulfil this objective. We think that they should. We think that things should be done with those guidelines. Indeed, we should look at the entire regime again and make sure that that is the first and the last thing looked at before we do anything with Australian defence exports. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight the Senate is debating the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 which was introduced into the chamber on 30 August. I remind the Senate that this is the third omnibus tax bill to be before us this year. I understand we will be debating two more before the Senate rises prior to Christmas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill, as usual, covers a large range of unrelated income tax measures and also sales tax measures, most of which have a minimal impact on revenue. The exception is the implementation of the reportable payments system which will add $400 million in revenue to the government coffers over the next four years. In fact, the bill was subject to a public hearing on Monday, 19 September by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. The committee heard evidence concerning the provisional tax uplift factor, the dependent spouse rebate and sales tax on re-manufactured goods sold or leased to exempt users, and also received submissions on a number of other issues. Unfortunately, time did not permit consideration of a number of other matters which were of interest to certain committee members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is not opposed but there are a number of measures which leave a bitter aftertaste in the mouth of each and every coalition member. Not the least of these is maintaining the provisional uplift factor at eight per cent. In addition, the bill seeks to make changes to the CFC regime which is already becoming quite unmanageable and having a detrimental effect on Australian entities investing abroad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the tight time restraints in this place, I only have time to assess a select few elements of the bill. I refer first to regional headquarters. These measures, announced in the white paper on employment and growth in May, provide two types of incentives&mdash;income tax and sales tax&mdash;to attract regional headquarters of multinationals to our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision to provide some relief to regional headquarters comes after years of lobbying, particularly from the finance, accounting and legal sectors, and the measures are welcomed. Unfortunately, they are but a small step in the right direction needed to entice multinationals to use Australia instead of the traditional regional areas of Singapore and Hong Kong for companies operating in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surprisingly, the government announced two proposals this year which could actually deter multinationals from setting up regional headquarters here. The first&mdash;the draft overseas super funds bill which was released in June this year&mdash;proposed that multinationals employing expatriates retaining membership of home country superannuation funds would pay fringe benefits tax on contributions to the fund. It has been suggested that this meant that companies could pay up to three times what was originally intended to go to staff in super. That reference was by Helen Cudlipp from Coopers and Lybrand and appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 27 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second proposal is the changes in the budget threatening to put high capital gains tax and FBT on the typical employee share schemes operated by overseas companies, particularly American companies. On top of that, the ATO is seeking to apply fringe benefits tax to parts of salary packages such as housing allowances and return-home travel received by expatriates working in Australian regional headquarters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will only act to disenfranchise multinationals. Our tax regime is already not competitive with Asian centres such as Singapore which taxes approved Singapore operation headquarters at only 10 per cent of the fees, royalties and interest it earns in providing management, technical, financial and other supporting services to affiliates outside Singapore. As well, the headquarters is exempt from tax on foreign dividend income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook, pointed out that the Allen Consulting Group report launched on 1 July 1994 found that about 1,100 jobs and economic activity of $350 million a year are generated by the 65 multinationals having regional headquarters in Australia. Obviously, the state governments do not think that the federal government is doing enough. The Kennett government has lured some multinationals with its own incentives, including payroll and land tax concessions, and help on infrastructure development. Queensland has also taken its own initiative and introduced legislation to grant concessions and exemptions in relation to debits tax, land tax, payroll tax and stamp duty for regional headquarters situated in Queensland. We commend them for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all the advantages Australia has to offer, there are many reasons why Australia will have difficulty attracting regional headquarters. Lack of capital gains tax relief is likely to be a major impediment, closely followed by its nasty brother, the fringe benefits tax. Foreign business people looking at our FBT rules may be frightened by the complexity and cost of those laws and the new employee share option rules. There are also other problems: the uncertainty as to how much income the Australian regional headquarters should make, given that the transfer pricing provisions will presumably apply to the regional headquarters; and last but not least, that regional headquarters believe that their overseas income could be subject to ordinary Australian income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to eligible investment funds of registered organisations, I am pleased that the government has indicated that it will be withdrawing the provisions in the bill relating to the eligible investment funds of friendly societies to enable discussions to take place. My hope is that the government will listen with open ears to the very real concerns that those organisations had with the proposed legislation. I think it is somewhat reprehensible that the very important role undertaken by friendly societies over so many years in this country has been changed and that the types of products they will be offering their members will be taxed at such a rate that their lower income earner constituency will inevitably change. I ask the government to give special recognition to the tax impact it intends imposing on friendly societies in terms of the services that they render to their constituency, as the individuals generally have a taxable income very much below the tax rates that we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the dividend withholding tax exemption, which forms part of the regional headquarters package, this is not limited to shareholders of companies performing regional headquarters activities in Australia. It will also be available to non-resident shareholders of all Australian resident companies which derive qualifying foreign source dividend income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However&mdash;and here is the rub&mdash;Australian resident companies in a less than 100 per cent owned group will not benefit from the arrangement. How could we do such a thing? A number of major foreign shareholders in Australian publicly listed companies utilise Australian holding companies to hold those investments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a result of the definition of a related corporation for foreign dividend account purposes, a dividend paid by the Australian listed company out of its foreign income to the Australian holding company of its major non-resident shareholder cannot be paid out of the foreign dividend account and thus on-paid in turn free of dividend withholding tax to the non-resident shareholder. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about foreign bank branches? The amendments relating to the taxation of Australian branches of foreign banks are aimed at creating a more equitable tax regime for foreign bank branches operating in Australia. I note that Roger Hogan in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> on 4 July commented that foreign bankers are questioning how adequately the provisions reflect the realities of the marketplace, and how far they will help the government achieve its aim of making Australia a more competitive financial environment. The rhetoric does not match the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to sales tax on parts in re-manufactured goods, the bill implements a number of sales tax measures, including allowing a credit for parts, fittings and accessories used in the repair, renovation or upgrading of goods to be exported, provided the tax is not passed on in the price of the alterations. What it fails to do is exempt from sales tax parts used in the re-manufacture of goods by Australian corporations which are subsequently sold or leased to always exempt users, including government departments, exempt government agencies and other exempt non-profit organisations such as schools and hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This treatment is simply inconsistent with the sales tax treatment of new goods and imported re-manufactured goods sold or leased to the same people. This is an extraordinary situation. One can import goods, sell them to exempt users and get the sales tax provision, but re-manufactured Australian goods that are sold to the same person do not get the sales tax provision applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee stage I will put forward an amendment to exempt from sales tax parts used in the re-manufacture of goods for sale or lease to exempt users. Prior to the streamlined sales tax regime which commenced on 1 January 1993, spare parts used in repairs were treated as exempt from sales tax when the repaired goods were sold or leased in exempt circumstances, including sales and leases by always exempt users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, under the streamlined sales tax regime, parts used in repair are normally treated as taxable. In December last year, amendments introduced in this chamber allowed the recovery of the sales tax paid on parts used in the repair of goods where those goods were subsequently sold into the mining, agriculture or manufacturing industries for use as an exempt business input. This bill provides a similar credit in respect of spare parts used in goods re-manufactured or repaired and subsequently exported, to reinstate the pre-1 January 1993 status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments I will move in the committee stage will do the same thing for parts used in the re-manufacture of goods for sale or lease to exempt users, in terms of the work done here in Australia by Australian people for always exempt users. It was a promise given that there would not be any new taxation as a result of this change to streamline sales tax. This is a broken promise&mdash;and therefore we have a justification for moving an amendment in relation to this item. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An investigation of this item has raised another anomalous situation. I think it is opportune to bring it to the Senate's attention. I am talking about the sales tax exemption for farm equipment; it is only for cash. There is a major problem. Not everybody has the facility of being able to pay cash. A lot of people today lease farm equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While on this topic of streamlined sales tax, I want to indicate this other matter. When the government sought to provide relief last year, it did so through a credit arrangement for parts applied to own use in repairing farm machinery such as harvesters when that refurbished farm equipment was ultimately sold to farmers quoting sales tax certificates. Unfortunately, the relief given was discriminatory since it applied only where a farmer acquires farm machinery not for cash, but under a lease. It seems anomalous that, in these difficult times, farmers face a financial penalty or even a denial of equipment if, owing to financial constraints or other valid reasons, they cannot or do not want to purchase for cash. I call upon the government to give this matter serious consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Royal Flying Doctor Service? There are problems with that. The bill contains an amendment to reinstate the exemption for persons who use wireless transceivers to make contact with radio services conducted by the Royal Australian Flying Doctor Service and similar bodies. Do honourable senators remember the ABC advertising at the weekend, raising money for the flying doctor service? I commend the ABC and the flying doctor service for their initiative and coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw to the Senate's attention a third problem with the sales tax legislation, one which is not addressed by this bill. Prior to streamlined sales tax, there was an exemption for wireless transceivers `for use'&mdash;they are the operative words&mdash;in conjunction with the radio service conducted by the RFDS and other similar services. The term `for use' was accepted as meaning an appreciable or significant use of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current sales tax legislation exempts wireless transceivers for use by an authorised person `mainly' in conjunction with radio services for the RFDS and others. I have received a representation that the inclusion of the word `mainly' in the legislation has effectively removed the exemption for most people authorised to use wireless transceivers, because it is extremely difficult to satisfy the `for use mainly' test. `Mainly' is defined as meaning `to the extent of more than 50 per cent'. The explanatory memorandum of the Sales Tax (Classifications and Exemptions) Bill 1992, which implements the streamlined sales tax regime, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there will be no significant change in the coverage of the exemption.</PARA>
<PARA>However, it continued to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . wireless transceivers could satisfy that test and still be used mainly for another purpose. To more clearly focus the exemption, it will now apply to wireless transceivers for use mainly with those services.</PARA>
<PARA>One must assume that the significant change to the test was unintended if this is the only reason given for the change in wording. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many users of wireless transceivers in remote areas, including travellers in remote areas, mining company employees, residents in remote localities and transport industry workers. Naturally, those users would also utilise their transceivers for personal and private communications. Despite the improvement in telephone communications, most homesteads in remote Australia still retain HF receivers for emergency use and to talk to workers on their property. This is the only contact these workers can have for emergency purposes with the RFDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding this, under the current legislation all these users purchasing radio transceivers will not receive the sales tax exemption unless they buy the receiver mainly for emergency situations. This will thwart the purpose and use of transceivers, which are invaluable in the event of emergency. Transceivers are an essential safety measure in outback Australia. Tragic accidents could have been avoided if victims had had HF transceivers. The government should be using exemptions, such as exemptions from sales tax, to encourage users to purchase receivers&mdash;instead of worrying about a few dollars of sales tax revenue it would have to forgo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I would like to point out to the government that the Adelaide branch of the ATO has given interim approval to one manufacturer of transceivers to classify radio transceivers on the basis of the exemption under the old sales tax legislation. Here again we have a favourable, good decision from Adelaide; but it is inconsistent with the act. I call upon the government to clarify the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I call on the government to take close note of the comments I have made in relation to just a few of the many difficulties arising from this legislation before us today. The bill clearly illustrates the dangers involved in the simplification of legislation. Time and time again in this chamber we have heard that provisions of the streamlined sales tax legislation do not reflect the tenor of its predecessor. This should give the government an idea of the dangers which the new taxation substantiation bill faces. Business has waited years for that legislation. I certainly hope it measures up to the high expectations the government has created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that there have been some good recommendations, in terms of the first attempt. But I do not believe they go far enough because, if the underlying philosophy is under question, plain English will not overcome that difficulty. We will perhaps address those issues in greater detail in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4), which will be around shortly. The article by Michael Dwyer recently in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> suggested that taxpayers and practitioners, under the possibility of needing substantiation, will have to examine the old and the new acts to work out their obligations. This is not the consequence that business had hoped for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I finish, I would like to foreshadow an amendment in relation to the home child-care allowance, an amendment that will be moved in the committee stage by my colleague Senator Patterson. That issue was subject to debate. We note the government will be putting an amendment in order to honour its commitments, so that people will not be worse off under the new arrangements and will have the facility, as from the end of September, to use the new allowance&mdash;paid under Social Security&mdash;or continue the income tax measure in the form of a rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For people moving to the child-care allowance under Social Security, I remind them that they need to see their paymaster because new declaration forms will have to be lodged. Failure to lodge will mean that the pay will be taken out at a rate of tax which is not consistent with what ultimately they will be assessed upon. They could well be up for $1,000 or more in tax as a result of these changes. I suggest they consult their paymasters immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will have to do some sums to see whether they will be worse off in terms of the new allowances under Social Security than they were under the income tax rebate scheme. I foreshadow an amendment to be moved by my colleague Senator Patterson. Her concerns are that this measure would be best addressed using Social Security arrangements. Senator Patterson will be addressing those issues not only during the second reading debate but also during the committee stage, when she will be putting her amendment. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is another omnibus bill which proposes to make a variety of changes to Australia's taxation law. It covers measures announced in the last two budgets and in the government's employment white paper which was handed down in May of this year. My colleague Senator Watson has the main carriage of this bill for the opposition, particularly so far as the technical aspects of it are concerned, along with my other colleague Senator Patterson. I do not propose to go into much, if any, detail of the specific measures. I will leave that to Senator Watson and Senator Patterson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some things I want to say about the bill and the context in which it was introduced, both of a specific and a general nature. The bill covers a number of sales tax amendments, including measures which were first uncovered as problems during the 1992 Senate Select Committee on Sales Tax Legislation. That legislation&mdash;I note that Senator McMullan is here at the moment; I think he was one of those who were loudest in hailing that exercise as one of major simplification&mdash;turned out to raise more areas of concern and confusion with respect to wholesale sales tax than was the situation in the old law. Far from it turning out to be a simplification exercise, as the opposition told the government it would be at the time, it proved to be even more complicated than in the past and even more confusing and costly to the clients of the tax department, particularly so far as small businesses were concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the government at the time, with the support of the Australian Democrats, in a desperate hurry to rush through that flawed wholesale sales tax overhaul before the 1993 election, ignored a number of very serious issues which were raised in the submissions presented to the Senate committee and in the evidence given at hearings of that committee. I recall that Senator Watson and I, who were very active in that committee, along with those people who agreed with us, knew that the government was causing more problems than it was seeking to solve. I note that, two years later, the government is proposing some amendments which should have been incorporated into the legislation before it became law, but I do not believe it has gone far enough even now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also contains amendments to another of Labor's hotchpotch pieces of major taxation law; namely, that of foreign source income. The government's taxation treatment of what are known as FIFs has been identified as one of the most complex and onerous burdens in Australian taxation history. These further necessary amendments that the government is now proposing seek only to illustrate the flaws in the current regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other measures in this bill are the relatively limited provisions of taxation relief for regional headquarters as announced in the so-called Working Nation statement; consequential changes required to implement the home child-care allowance and partner allowance, about which Senator Patterson will go into in some detail; and foreign branch banking proposals first announced in June 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major item in the bill&mdash;it is a controversial one&mdash;is the reduction in the uplift factor for provisional tax from 10 per cent to only eight per cent&mdash;a relatively small reduction. That is being done at a time when inflation is being forecast by the government to be something like 2 1/4 per cent and there is an average earnings growth of about 3.5 per cent. So there is certainly a major discrepancy between the uplift factor and inflation. Even if we were to take into account the average earnings growth and add it in, we would see that there is still a very major discrepancy between inflation and earnings growth on the one hand and the uplift factor on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By reducing the uplift factor further below the limited reduction to eight per cent, the government would not lose revenue in the longer run but would delay and reduce its collection this year and therefore put more money in the hands of business and less in the hands of government. At a time when capital expenditure is important for small business, this tax slug, which takes cash out of firms' hands and puts it into the government's pocket for 12 months, will only hinder the opportunities for small businesses to expand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eight per cent uplift factor is yet another government induced cost burden on small business and on retired and self-employed people&mdash;the very people over whom the government, as I said in a debate earlier today, sheds crocodile tears. But when it comes to the actual actions of government it does nothing but cause them more and more hardship. It is unfair, I believe, in the current low inflation and low earnings environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a budget measure, and that is something that the coalition takes into account in its consideration of its attitude towards the bill. Nevertheless, it is a matter of the strongest condemnation and criticism of the government that it should be attacking small business in this way at this time against the advice of most people, including members of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure, amongst others in the bill, shows the Keating Labor government's complete lack of commitment and/or understanding to making Australian industry world competitive. That surely is what we all ought to be about. If we want to raise our living standards here in Australia, if we want to improve our quality of life, we have to make Australia increasingly an internationally competitive country. That means doing things which assist businesses, both small and large, rather than inhibit and retard them in the way this government does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, I refer the Senate to the recent World Economic Forum's competitiveness index, which shows Australia lagging at number 15. That is despite our nation's immense natural resources, our stable political system, our high levels of education and qualifications and our geographical position on the edge of the world's fastest growing and largest regional market. Top of the list in the World Economic Forum's competitive index, the title of the most competitive nation, is the United States&mdash;a nation regularly derided by this Labor government, particularly during the years of republican administration, an administration which has returned America to a position as a world leader; a nation which, notwithstanding its own problems, has a much lower level of debt as a proportion of GDP and also a much lower level of unemployment than we have; and a nation which has arguably the world's highest living standards despite the problems that it, along with other nations, faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To highlight the starkness of the contrast between the United States' position and ours, in 1992&mdash;the last year for which I have comparable figures&mdash;the United States net foreign debt ratio as a proportion of GDP was 9.3 per cent. Australia's figure was no less than 39 per cent. In other words, our foreign debt as a proportion of our total annual income was four times greater than that of the United States. That puts an enormous millstone around the neck of the Australian economy, the neck of Australian business and the neck of Australian exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this competitiveness index, second, third and fourth are three of our Asian neighbours&mdash;Singapore, Japan and Hong Kong, respectively. Setting aside Japan, which is a fully-fledged developed country, the other two have always been regarded by Australia as developing countries and not in the same league as we are. How things change! After 11 years of Labor government in this country, those two nations&mdash;Singapore and Hong Kong&mdash;have now surpassed Australian living standards and look set to continue to leave Australia further behind as they continue their high growth rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that those two nations have taken distinctly different paths to prosperity: Singapore has taken a far more authoritarian approach to government policy than Hong Kong, or even Australia in some respects; Hong Kong has flourished as the closest thing to a laissez faire system that the world presently has. If we are not just going to keep up but to surpass other countries in competitive growth we have to find our own way of doing it and not just ape other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today, as a matter of urgency, on behalf of the coalition I initiated a debate on the failure of the government to follow its policy and take the sort of action that will result in sustained employment and economic growth. It is incredible that this government and, in particular, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, have been so arrogantly complacent about the problems facing our nation, saying that there is not much more that this government needs to do to put in place the reforms that are necessary if we are to get sustainable long term growth. As a nation, we cannot afford to sit idly by while the rest of the world streaks on past us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of our key economic statistics point to the fact that we are dropping back in the competitiveness race. Our basic economic statistics show that we have continuing mass unemployment&mdash;still almost 10 per cent as compared with 3 per cent for Hong Kong and Singapore, 6 per cent for the United States and 8 per cent or so for New Zealand. There are many other countries which are also much lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the largest, most rapidly growing current account deficit of any country in the western world. It is already over 4 per cent of our annual national income. That is certain to be significantly exceeded in the course of this year judging by the figures we saw last month of a $2.1 billion current account deficit&mdash;the third largest in our history despite the fact that we are still in the relatively early stages of economic recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of government policy the cost of capital is enormously high. If we look at the 10-year bond rate, we see that real interest rates are now more than 10 per cent while in Japan they are 4 per cent, in New Zealand they are 6 per cent, in the United States they are 4 1/2 per cent and in the United Kingdom they are 6 to 6 1/2 per cent. In other words, we are putting an added burden on our industry and individual borrowers by these relatively high real interest rates&mdash;certainly high by comparison with other countries and even by comparison with our historical standards. Indeed, in the western world, only Sweden and Canada&mdash;for both of which there are some exceptional explanatory circumstances&mdash;have higher real interest rates than Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the continuing problem of low investment. Private fixed capital expenditure in Australia is still at a near low record level. Even if the government attains the growth in capital expenditure of 14 1/2 per cent that it forecast for this year, that still will not bring us up to the average level of the past. If we do not have a high level of investment we will not get the job creation and economic growth that is absolutely essential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Linked inexorably to that is the level of national savings. We still have near record low levels of national savings. As the ANZ research department recently said, it is only in the last two quarters that as a nation we have had any positive savings at all. We had a run of eight quarters or more where we lost savings each quarter rather than gained them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those matters should be of very considerable concern. They point out very starkly that if we continue the way we are going there is no way in the world that the present level of acknowledged economic growth&mdash;we do not deny today's report that we are near a five-year high in economic growth&mdash;can be sustained if we do not put in place the necessary, underpinning changes and reforms. If we were not seeing the sort of economic growth we are having at the moment we should be very worried because we are in the process of coming out of one of the most protracted recessions on record. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many things that can and should be done. This is not a situation outside our control.

We can give flexibility to award and enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can increase national savings by giving incentives to save and by running a responsible fiscal policy rather than the reckless, huge deficit policy that this government has pursued for many years now. We can increase national savings by reducing public debt, by privatising many government corporations, and by increasing the flexibility of superannuation operations and options.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes an extensive list of alterations to income tax legislation relating to reportable payments, foreign investment funds, income tax concessions for regional headquarters, social security payments, provisional tax, deductions for bequests and gifts, superannuation and to a variety of sales tax provisions. I wish to speak on one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), namely, the consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 required as a result of the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments to the act are necessary to complement the payment of the new home child-care allowance for couples with dependent children. The amendments will remove a taxpayer's entitlement to the dependent spouse rebate where the taxpayer's spouse qualifies for the home child-care allowance. The amendments also exempt home child-care allowance payments from income tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments as proposed in this section of the bill as drafted would have meant that, where the spouse of a taxpayer qualifies for the home child-care allowance, the taxpayer would not be entitled to claim the dependent spouse rebate through the tax system. The government has obviously become increasingly aware of the very considerable disquiet surrounding the way in which the home child-care allowance is being implemented, and particularly the sleight of hand involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very fact that the government has indicated that it will move an amendment to provide that families are able to fall back on the without-child dependent spouse rebate if they qualify for that rebate is a good indication that the government has realised that the legislation was fundamentally flawed. The bill is another example of so much of this government's legislation&mdash;particularly legislation which deals with the family. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each time the government introduces a new proposal it is announced with a great deal of `politically correct' rhetoric and public relations hype which is intended to disguise the reality. Inevitably it turns out to be little more than a clever sleight of hand. In the end, there is little improvement for the majority of families, and there is a serious deterioration in the situation of many, despite Mr Keating's constant claims, in this case, that no family would be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should remember the parenting allowance and the splitting of the newstart and jobstart allowances. The parenting allowance was announced in the white paper amid vocal claims by the Prime Minister about supporting the family. It was proclaimed as a parenting allowance of up to $132.65 per week for families in which only one parent is employed. In reality, it applied to only about 118,000 Australian families and most of those were going to receive far less than $132.65 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the day of the election the Prime Minister said that a person staying at home caring for a child would get $30. There was also incredible hype surrounding the announcement that jobstart and newstart would be split between an unemployed married couple. There was to be no more money; in fact, it was to be the same amount of money and it was paid to two people instead of one. We heard a lot of rhetoric about the government doing great things for families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation to introduce the home child-care allowance was no different. When the Senate debated the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partners Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993, I described it as a pea and thimble sleight of hand where the government took with one hand and gave with the other. Before the last election the government deliberately gave the impression that women at home would get an extra $30 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After Mr Keating appeared on television that day I can remember somebody saying to me, `Where are they going to get the money from?' It is clear that the government was going to get the money from the dependent spouse rebate. However, many people did not realise that until they found that they were not getting it in their tax. People thought they were going to get both allowances, but they were hoodwinked. In fact, those people were going to get a mere $2.60&mdash;the price of a loaf of bread and a litre of milk. That is not what Mr Keating said when he made the announcement during the election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation was exactly like that of the Christmas appeal. The government said, `We will match dollar for dollar in the Christmas appeal'. What happened when the charities went along? It was dollar for dollar raised and spent during Christmas time, not dollar for dollar raised. Every time Mr Keating makes an announcement there is a trick involved. Hopefully, Australians have woken up that every time Mr Keating opens his mouth with a promise they can bet their bottom dollar&mdash;well, the last dollar they have&mdash;that he will take that dollar and give it back somewhere else. In other words, people will not be receiving a new dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many of those families who heard the promise made by the Prime Minister that a person at home was going to get $30 a week ever understood that the dependent spouse rebate was going to be taken away? Very few, if any. The Prime Minister said that no family would be worse off under the home child-care allowance. It was almost as good as Mr Hawke's promise that no child would live in poverty. Mr Keating's promise was a great big distortion of the truth, if I am allowed to say that. I will not use the word `lie', but he was distorting the truth or skating on the circumference of the truth. Thousands of families were going to be worse off. Once again, the government gave with one hand and took with the other and tricked people into thinking that they were going to get $30 extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it clear that, when the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill was debated, the coalition acknowledged that a number of real benefits would be derived from transferring families with dependent spouses and children from the dependent spouse rebate to the home child-care allowance. These benefits included the home child-care allowance being paid directly to the parent caring for the child or children; this was a step in the direction of recognising the contribution of those people caring for children at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also acknowledged that the home child-care allowance was being paid at a slightly higher maximum rate of $60 per fortnight. We also acknowledged that families whose tax liability was too low to receive the full benefit of the dependent spouse rebate were eligible for the home child-care allowance. We also acknowledged that parents leaving the paid work force to care for a dependent child would perhaps be able to claim the home child-care allowance, even though their income for that financial year might exceed the dependent spouse rebate income threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the coalition pointed out some very serious problems with the home child-care allowance. Many of these concerns remain and, together with the confusion evident in the community, were highlighted in evidence given to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will list some of the injustices in this legislation. There was no mention in the Labor Party policy document that families with students in full-time education would be excluded; that families who were temporarily overseas would be excluded; that families with students receiving Austudy would be excluded; or that families would be excluded as a result of the more onerous Social Security income definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate an example of some families overseas. As chairman of a large academic department, I know for a fact that when many young academics go on study leave they do so at considerable personal expense. They uproot their families, they go to another country, and they are being paid within the income tax system within Australia. They have to try to rent their homes and they have to have accommodation overseas. They receive no extra income. Many of these people go overseas with no scholarships&mdash;I know; I have done it myself, and I know how costly it is. They have to pay for airfares. </PARA>

After all, we talk about excellence in education. These people get done like a duck's dinner.

These people are not going to get their home child-care allowance because they are out of the country for a period of time. Academics can be away for periods from six months to 12 months.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the short time available to me tonight I would like to pay a respectful tribute to a man who was the former head of the Prime Minister's department for many years and who was, in my view, one of Australia's greatest public servants, Sir Geoffrey John Yeend, who died last Thursday on 6 October aged 67, having been born on 1 May 1927. Sir Geoffrey&mdash;or as most people knew him, Geoff Yeend&mdash;really was a tremendous public servant and a wonderful person. I cannot claim to have been a close friend of Geoff Yeend, but I did know him personally and well over many years. Therefore, I would like to pay this tribute to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is the second major public service figure to have died recently&mdash;the most recent one, of course, was Sir Frederick Wheeler, who died at the age of 80 just a couple of months ago. In many ways they were both of the same school and of a similar mould because they believed totally in the integrity and impartiality of public service and in the essential value of the due process of administration as the only way to lead to ongoing impartial and correct policy making decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my remarks tonight I shall draw very heavily on some of the comments that have been made in obituaries in recent days, particularly by John Farquharson in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> and by Stuart Hamilton in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. As far as Geoff Yeend's career was concerned, his whole life was spent in public service. He started in the Commonwealth Public Service in 1945, or thereabouts, when he joined the then very powerful Department of Post-War Reconstruction. He joined that department after having spent a couple of years towards the end of the war in the 2nd AIF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He spent four years in the Department of Post-War Reconstruction before joining the Department of Prime Minister in 1950, where he was the personal assistant to the then head of the Prime Minister's department, Sir Allen Brown. After a couple of years he went across to the Old Parliament House, where he was the principal private secretary to the then Prime Minister, Mr Robert Menzies, from 1952 to 1955. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that he became principal private secretary to Robert Menzies at the age of 25, which is something worth noting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that he went to London, where he was an assistant secretary to the Australian High Commission between 1958 and 1960, having gone back to the Prime Minister's department after his stint with Menzies. In 1961 he was appointed an assistant secretary to the Prime Minister's department and six years later a first assistant secretary. In 1971 he won a Churchill fellowship and went abroad for about six months on that fellowship, something that he always very highly regarded. When he came back in 1972 he was appointed deputy secretary to the Department of Prime Minister. In 1977, or thereabouts, he was appointed by the then Prime Minister Fraser as head of the department following the death of Sir Alan Carmody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He had the wonderful knack of being able to serve governments and leaders of all political persuasions with equal impartiality. He worked through governments ranging from the Curtin years through to the Hawke years. He retired due to ill health in 1986 whilst head of the department under Prime Minister Hawke. Stuart Hamilton, who worked with him for many years, in his article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many qualities stood out for those fortunate to work with Yeend: his calmness at times of crisis . . . his essential decency and integrity; his capacity to distil the essence of a complex argument or tortuous negotiation in a short well-crafted piece of advice, with a cunningly placed sting or sweetener that would entice the recipient; his great kindness to staff at times of private stress; and his capacity to attract and act as a mentor to staff from around the service&mdash;no fewer than 13 officers who worked for him as secretary at some point in their career went on to become secretaries of Commonwealth departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He took a deep interest in Public Service renewal and reform throughout his career . . . His interests were not limited to his career, nor was his commitment to service. He had longstanding involvement with hockey at the local, national and international levels . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He worked with many service organisations as diverse as the Multiple Sclerosis Society, the National Gallery Foundation, the Australia-Japan Foundation, the Australian Volleyball Association, the National Eisteddfod and the Menzies Memorial Trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On his death last week many people have paid tribute to him. The Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, very rightly stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Sir Geoffrey will be remembered as much for the many things he achieved as for the person he was: wise, kind and generous . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"He was an outstanding Australian who excelled in his many fields of endeavour and whose qualities of integrity, loyalty and service made him so respected and admired throughout the community."</PARA>
<PARA>The former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser, who, as I said, appointed Sir Geoffrey as head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet in the late 1970s, described him as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "one of Australia's best public servants in the traditional sense, something we have probably lost for all time because of the politicisation of the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Any government would have had total faith in Sir Geoffrey . . .</PARA>
<PARA>To those of us who had the privilege of knowing him at some stage and in some way during his long and illustrious career, I think we would certainly say `Amen' to that. To finish on a lighter note, it was of Sir Geoffrey that the famous story, which apparently is true, has come through the folklore of recent years. In 1982, when the then Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser was hospitalised, Sir Geoffrey, as his permanent head, and Doug Anthony, who was the acting Prime Minister, went to see Malcolm Fraser in hospital. While they were there the program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS> was playing on television. They all stopped and had a look at this segment of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Minister</EMPHASIS>. Walking out after having seen Malcolm Fraser, Doug Anthony and Geoff Yeend said one to the other, `Did you notice that we all laughed but at different spots?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in many ways epitomises a great deal about Geoff Yeend. He was a person who lived with politics. In many ways he was above politics. In many ways he was a very skilled bureaucratic politician, getting the best out of everyone in the governments for which he worked in such an impartial way. He will be very sadly missed by all of those who knew him. To his widow Laurel and his family, I extend my deepest sympathy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise with some regret tonight to speak on a matter which concerns people in Queensland and to criticise people in the Queensland government whom I have known for many years. I believe that small people in Queensland have been treated with great injustice in a number of instances, and I do not believe that a government should hide behind its ability to cover up embarrassing actions by its agents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Wednesday, 31 August, Senator Jocelyn Newman, chair of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, tabled her committee's unanimous all-party report in the Senate. One recommendation in the report called on `the Queensland government to establish an independent investigation into certain unresolved whistleblower cases within its jurisdiction.' One such case was the Lindeberg case. On the same day, Queensland senators Warwick Parer and Cheryl Kernot placed on the public record certain facts which showed that a prima facie conspiracy to attempt to obstruct justice had occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> of 1 September 1994 covered Senator Parer's speech in the Senate which brought the issue alive on the floor of parliament in Queensland. That evening the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> featured Kevin Lindeberg's four-year struggle to expose the illegal shredding and its cover-up. The debate in the Queensland parliament led to the tabling by Minister Warner on 2 September 1994 of a crucial letter from the office of cabinet to the state archivist dated 23 February 1990 which set out the reason why cabinet sought the archivist's urgent approval to destroy these public records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That crucial letter had been sought by Lindeberg since January 1993 under an FOI application. The letter had been held by the information commissioner for over 10 months. Key passages had been withheld. The information commissioner had been fully informed by evidence that the Heiner material was central to and required in known anticipated litigation, and that the `cabinet exempt' passages in the letter of 23 February 1990 were of pivotal importance in establishing the offence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet's decision outlined in the letter of 23 February 1990 sought the destruction of the material because `it was no longer required or pertinent to the public record'. That was demonstrably false. Its contents proved one crucial element in establishing the conspiracy to obstruct justice. The only element left unresolved was who conclusively knew about Mr Coyne's anticipated litigation in which that evidence was central to those foreshadowed court proceedings. That answer was also resolved in documentation acknowledged by Minister Warner in parliament on 6 September 1994 and later confirmed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> on 8 September 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Warner informed parliament on 18 May 1993 that cabinet took the decision to destroy these public records on 5 March 1990 `in order to reduce the risk of legal action against any of the parties involved'. Throughout this period there was plenty of time to double-check with Mr Coyne regarding his intention to commence court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One crucial question in this conspiracy remains unresolved in pinpointing all the conspirators with full knowledge before the offence. Many questions remain unanswered. Did Minister Warner inform her cabinet colleagues of all the facts on 5 March 1990, including Mr Coyne's legal notice of 15 February 1990, and the support of his litigation by two unions in seeking a court decision concerning access to those public records under public service management and employment regulation 65? Or did she withhold crucial information on the three times it came to cabinet before the shredding was ordered in order to reduce the risk of legal action?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Warner informed parliament that cabinet allegedly acted on the advice of the state archivist and crown solicitor. Evidence now shows that this is not and cannot be true. It is now established that the state archivist was not given all the facts. She was misled by one or more public officials by not being informed of Mr Coyne's statutory demand on the material of 8 February 1990 and foreshadowed court proceedings of 15 February 1990. It is an offence under the Queensland criminal code and Criminal Justice Act of 1989 to cause any public official not to act honestly and impartially. The state archivist could only do that by knowing all the facts when executing her public duties in this matter. Her duty is to protect public records in the public interest. Important facts were withheld from her in order to commit the offence of obstructing justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is contradictory in itself that cabinet sought her urgent approval to destroy public records no longer required or pertinent to the public record. Why the haste over documents of no seeming importance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The crown solicitor's advice which allegedly advised cabinet to shred public records was dated 16 February 1990. Minister Warner confirmed publicly on 8 September 1994 that she never received Mr Coyne's solicitor's notice until 19 February 1990. How could the crown solicitor's advice support cabinet's decision when it was written on 16 February 1990, three days earlier? The crown solicitor's written advice could not have addressed Mr Coyne's official notification by Minister Warner's own admission because its alleged receipt occurred after the crown solicitor's advice was written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other issues certainly impinge on this matter. It is with no great pleasure that I place these issues on the public record. Much more could be said; particularly the fact that, eventually, Mr Lindeberg lost his position with the trade union and ever since has been castigated and prejudiced in his ability to gain employment. I believe that it needs much further investigation and I would hope that the Senate, if not the Queensland government, would take that kind of action. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.40 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I agree totally with the sentiments of my colleague Senator Woodley and support his statements, I rise to speak briefly on a very different topic; that is, age as a rationale for health care. It is a disturbing concept that has been raised in the past month in several different arenas. Dr Colin Honey, Director of the Kingswood Centre for Ethics, in some comments which achieved front page headlines in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> last month, gave an impetus to the provocative thesis that is emerging in many Western countries and now in Australia that age should be a limiting factor in decisions to allocate certain kinds of health services to the elderly. This concept serves to debase old age at a time when it should be affirmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Giving the aged poor their pension and providing them with medical care is at the very least a prerequisite for their self-respect and their dignity, but it is not a sufficient condition. More importantly, it is the manner of the giving that counts and the moral basis on which it is given. Propositions such as using age as a rationale for health care undermine respect and dignity as components of a moral society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there are times when a decision to remove a life support system must be made, we should be disturbed and anxious when our society talks about setting involuntary limits. If age becomes a limiting factor in the provision of medical treatment, apart from the obvious appalling consequences to which many have already taken objection, there is another consequence, presumably unintended, which I wish to emphasise. The limits that will be set according to this rationale will be limits that affect women much more drastically than they affect men because of their longer life expectancy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to suggest that Dr Honey intended to be sexist as well as ageist; however, with age as a criterion for health care, women are put in a most precarious position. Not only are there many more elderly women than men, but also these older women are poorer, more apt to live alone and less likely to have informal social and personal supports than their male counterparts. Furthermore, a disproportionate number of nursing home patients are women. None of the arguments for rationing health care by age takes note of the implications for women of employing such a criterion, nor of the special plight of older women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the arguments about the limits of society's obligations to the aged acknowledges the historical failures of the health care system to note gender differences in medical research, diagnosis and treatment. None of the arguments addresses the question of whether there might be differences in the definition of natural lifespan or one's perception of a tolerable death&mdash;a death that occurs when one has accomplished what life has to offer&mdash;that are gender relative. None of the arguments takes note of the fact that the limits suggested would have tragic consequences for women. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A biographical definition of life fails to take adequate note of the differences in the biographies of men and women. To believe that it is desirable to adopt the use of an age standard suggests that a woman's life should be viewed as completed earlier in her biological chronology than it actually is; that is, when procreation, child rearing, housekeeping and the maintaining of conjugal relationships are complete. One could be forgiven for thinking that when men feel that their lifespan will be over they similarly feel that nobody else will have any importance. The argument in favour of believing that there is an appropriate time in a person's biography for claiming that her life could be considered full could be advancing forms of male bias: both a general devaluation of women's concerns and an indifference to a woman's life possibilities, apart from her use in more servile positions in relation to men. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A biographical definition of life also seems to measure a person's life by the notion of a range of experiences without taking note of any qualitative measure of those experiences. In so far as women have historically been disadvantaged with respect to their achievements, their interests, their economic, social and political status, and their sexuality, many would argue that the quality of their life experiences has been so low that with respect to what counts as a tolerable death such a definition begs the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the value attached to providing for another financially, women's responsibility to others continues in large part to be described as consisting in caring work, kin work, consumption work and other forms of so-called invisible work&mdash;and, of course, largely unpaid work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is easy to imagine someone arguing that a women who is single, or who outlives her spouse or whose children are independent, has also outlived her usefulness and her obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, because women live longer than men and have been in the work force a shorter time than men, and hence have less provision for their old age, women could also be perceived as undeservedly requiring more in the way of others' responsibilities towards them. As the largest and poorest population of the elderly, women will have the greatest need for increased social and non-financial forms of support as well as health care. This could be used against them in the evaluation of health resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of an age criterion for determining how to allocate health care resources seems to manifest society's perception that youth is valuable and advanced age, particularly female age, has less worth. The social implications of this are far too reminiscent of the ideal Aryan race. Again, because of their numbers, women constitute the majority of those affected by abuse and neglect. Attitudes that support these practices can only be reinforced by the belief that there is an age beyond which one is getting more than her fair share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, arguments for rationing on the basis of age seem to rest on the presumption that there is little value in providing certain health services to people who have reached the end of `full and natural lives'. That presumption is not gender neutral nor isolated in the health area, but could equally be applied to the arguments surrounding women's employment conditions, superannuation and pension age. Setting age limits for health services not only debases old age and engenders outrage, despair and sadness but is a frightening indictment of how far new right economics dominates our political climate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) It is general Government policy to encourage overseas companies, whether defence or non-defence related, to establish operations in Australia as a base for exports and other dealings with Asia.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence policy for industry recognises that ADF peacetime materiel requirements may not, of themselves, generate sufficient business to sustain the industry capabilities in Australia that Defence needs. Local defence industry is encouraged to compete for defence business overseas within a framework of defence export controls, as an adjunct to its support for the ADF. In addition, and as outlined in Strategic Review 1993, exports to South-East Asia and the South-West Pacific in particular can serve Australia's objective of regional security.</PARA>

In addition, all major private health insurers have a pre-existing medical conditions exclusion clause of 12 months. The OSHC pre-existing condition exclusion clause is for an 18 month period. The operation of the OSHC is governed by a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) dated 5 March 1993 between the then Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, the Health Insurance Commission and my Department. The MOU qualifies the operation of the pre-existing medical conditions exclusion clause by stating "This exclusion does not apply where a medical practitioner reasonably certifies, and Medibank Private agrees, that the student required emergency or unforeseen treatment in Australia in order that the student can continue his or her course of study."</PARA>

Additional ESL (English as a Second Language) services, if needed, may incur a separate fee to cover the additional tuition costs.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The significance of osteoporosis in Australia in terms of its incidence and costs was one of a range of issues considered by a workshop of osteoporosis experts convened by the Deputy Prime Minister and the then Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services, the Hon. Brian Howe MP, in August 1992. The workshop reviewed available data sources and concluded that it was difficult to estimate accurately the extent of osteoporosis in Australia because of the lack of comprehensive national data. It was agreed that osteoporosis could affect up to one in three Australian women and a smaller proportion of men. It was also noted that two community-based studies which are being conducted would provide more direct estimates of the incidence and costs of osteoporosis in Australia: namely, the Dubbo Osteoporosis Study and the Geelong Study.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the annual cost of osteoporosis to the Australian community, the workshop noted that this had been estimated as ranging from $200 million to $500 million.</PARA>

MBAC is an independent statutory body, comprising eight medical practitioners from a range of disciplines, which advises the Minister for Human Services and Health on the application of Medicare benefits to specified health services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In developing its advice, MBAC reviewed current scientific knowledge and clinical practice in regard to bone densitometry and consulted with experts in the osteoporosis and bone densitometry fields. MBAC recommended that the payment of Medicare benefits should be confined to two clinical applications of bone densitometry, with a series of measures to promote quality and appropriate use of the technology. These are, firstly, in the confirmation and monitoring of established osteoporosis and, secondly, in the diagnosis and monitoring of bone loss associated with a specific set of clinical conditions and/or treatments including, among others, rheumatoid arthritis and chronic renal disease. Two items have been included in the Medicare Benefits Schedule corresponding to these two recommended clinical applications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the use of bone densitometry as a screening tool to detect developing osteoporosis, MBAC concluded that there was insufficient scientific evidence to warrant the payment of Medicare benefits for this purpose. However, women who are receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or other treatments for osteoporosis, are eligible for Medicare benefits for bone densitometry as part of the monitoring of their condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In line with MBAC's recommendations, the Medicare benefit arrangements for bone densitometry will be reviewed twelve months after their introduction.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1), (3), (4) The Government is committed to a more efficient and ecologically sustainable transport sector. The efficient use of resources in transport is as critical to minimising environmental impacts as it is to promoting economic growth. A range of greenhouse gas reduction measures have been endorsed by the Commonwealth and the States at Ministerial level, including improved public awareness, enhanced investment in public transport such as CNG-powered buses and improved fuel efficiency standards. The most effective means of promoting ecological sustainability is through an integrated transport policy of which greenhouse emission reduction is an important part.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The location of production facilities close to effective public transport links will improve the efficiency of businesses while also reducing greenhouse gas production. This is an issue of some significance to State and local planning authorities and the Commonwealth Government has attempted to play a constructive role through the substantial funding (in excess of $800 million) provided to the Building Better Cities (BBC) program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has also contributed to the efficiency by which those goods which must move by road are transported. Time and energy savings have been generated through major commitments to improvements to the National Highways System. $820 million dollars is being spent this year on NHS projects, much of it directed towards ensuring that the transport task by road results in less fuel burnt per journey and thus less greenhouse gas production. At the same time, the Commonwealth strongly supports the efforts of the National Road Transport Commission (NRTC) to introduce more effective pricing of road transport through efficient vehicle registration pricing practices and standards&mdash;and is encouraging State jurisdictions to adopt the NRTC recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In rail, the Commonwealth has made major efforts since 1990 to improve the efficiency and competitiveness of rail services. The Commonwealth has committed some $430 million under the One Nation program to upgrading and improving the capabilities of our national rail network. In addition, the National Rail Corporation has been created by the Commonwealth and some States to ensure that rail operates in a competitive manner with road, and is able to offer genuinely national services to freight customers. The Commonwealth has provided substantial funding to the NRC, in excess of $300 million in new equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Under the National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS), the Government has developed, in consultation with industry, a fuel economy program for all new domestically sold passenger motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Negotiations have been finalised, and it is expected that an announcement on the Government's position on fuel economy measures for new passenger cars to the year 2005 will be announced shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As noted above, since July 1991 the Commonwealth Government has funded the `Building Better Cities' Program, the focus of which has been to better integrate urban land use planning. This program has a significant urban transport element. The Commonwealth has also established the Australian Urban and Regional Development Review, to develop options for building on the BBC initiative, including consideration of the role better urban planning plays in reducing greenhouse emissions.</PARA>
