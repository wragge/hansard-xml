<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleague Senator McMullan  for fundamentally answering the question for me with that interjection. It is simply not possible to make that kind of simplistic assessment for the simple reason that there are many farmers in the most drought-affected areas in Australia that are actually being subsidised on their interest rates. As a result of the very significant additional package that was provided in the last drought statement&mdash;I think in broad figures it was of the order of $50 million&mdash;a significant number of those farmers are now being assisted to the extent of receiving 100 per cent of those interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. To help the minister, I refer to the assessment made by the New South Wales Farmers Association&mdash;which at least has had a go at something I would have thought was very important to drought-affected farmers&mdash;which said that farmers' debt stands at approximately $17 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It said very few have benefited by the special interest rate subsidy and that debt is at $17 billion. The increase is therefore expected to cost up to $170 million. Was that fact not acknowledged by the Treasurer, Mr Willis, who stated on 24 October:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we can't delay necessary monetary policy adjustments because one sector of the economy is hurting.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I did see those figures. I will be happy to provide Senator Hill with the analysis that was done of it by ABARE. Of course we examined it. The fact is that it is not as simplistic as Senator Hill is asserting. I want to respond to the last part of that nonsense from Senator Hill in respect of the government's deficit. The facts are that in respect of the drought or anything else the only suggestion that I am getting from any opposition politician, whether it is from the federal parliament&mdash;the House of Representatives or the Senate&mdash;or from New South Wales, is to increase government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. The minister would be aware of a recent media campaign being conducted by the Leader of the National Party in the other house to have the Commonwealth appoint a drought aid ombudsman. Can the minister advise the Senate whether he has been approached directly on this matter and what action, if any, he has taken to consider the matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said in this chamber on a number of occasions, if the opposition comes up with any kind of decent policy proposal to help farming families then I will give it consideration. Sadly, however, this is just one more in a long line of failed proposals that in fact would not provide any kind of real assistance at all to farmers. I would assume that it is not actually coalition policy on the drought; it certainly was not mentioned by the shadow minister, but only by the Leader of the National Party to this point in time. The first time I heard of this proposal&mdash;and I suspect it was the first time that most coalition members heard of it&mdash;was when Mr Fischer was interviewed by Laurie Oakes&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because I got a letter from Mr Fischer yesterday on this&mdash;that is why. It was when he raised it on Channel Nine's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program nine days ago. Yesterday I received a letter dated the same day&mdash;that is, a `yesterday' letter nine days afterwards&mdash;from Mr Fischer proposing that we appoint a special ombudsman for drought. He ended the letter with a request to me to provide him with an early response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the appointment of a drought-aid ombudsman is not only unnecessary but also would be a gross waste of public money. Mr Fischer said that the ombudsman he is proposing should have four functions, all of which, I might add, are currently covered by various Commonwealth, state government and territory appeal mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's preferred approach is to assist drought relief applicants at the point of contact. As I told the Senate yesterday, we have recently provided an additional $450,000 for the appointment of further counsellors to provide that kind of direct assistance. I have to say that I would much rather spend half a million dollars of public money on providing additional financial and family counsellors for farmers than have the unnecessary appointment of an ombudsman, whose job apparently it would be to go around supervising the people who were doing the job.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth currently funds over 90 financial counsellors across the country, at an annual cost of around $4 million. These services are provided completely free of charge to primary producers. As I said yesterday, we have just augmented that with another half a million dollars to fund new family counselling services. These services are delivered direct to farmers on the ground. If farming families do genuinely encounter red tape, there is a range of appeal avenues already available to them under both Commonwealth and state processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures I gave in the chamber yesterday on the uptake of the drought relief payment would suggest that there is not any real problem at all with the uptake; in fact, thousands of farming families have already made application for it. It is little wonder that the peak rural industry organisations in Australia at the moment are&mdash;and I assure the Senate that they are&mdash;shaking their heads in disbelief at the federal coalition's response on how to assist farmers during this drought. The facts are that those opposite have demonstrated once again that the coalition leadership of Mr Downer and Mr Fischer simply is not up to the job.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GX5">Senator TROETH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Family Services. There have been three reports in the past three months which are a damning indictment of the government's child-care program. Child care is not adequately meeting the needs of parents, with the high cost of care and lack of flexibility in operating hours cited as two of the major complaints. The greatest areas of unmet demand are in occasional care, baby care, before and after school care, and care in rural areas. When will the minister and the government stop being driven by the union movement and start taking parents' and children's interests into account?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2538" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a remarkably cheeky question from the senator opposite, particularly in the light of what the opposition would do about child care. We have had a number of reports about child care, most of which we have asked for and all of which we welcome, pointing to ways in which we can improve child care. But Senator Troeth did not tell us in her question what all those reports say. For example, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice </EMPHASIS>report today says that 91 per cent of people using child care are satisfied or more than satisfied with it and that 95 per cent of people using child care are pleased with the quality of the care.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kemp should just wait; I have a message for him. The cost of care has been kept down remarkably. The latest CPI figures show that one thing keeping inflation low has been the reduction in the cost of child care, exactly due to this government's policies on affordability of child care. That does not mean we can rest; but it does mean we are acutely aware of the question of cost. It was that lot on the other side who rigorously opposed the introduction of the child-care cash rebate, which goes to helping keep down the cost of child care. Senator Minchin is one of the loudest of the people running around the country trying to cut out the child-care cash rebate. He is one of the people who joined Mrs Carroll to do away with what he voted for. He is one of those senators very close to Mr Downer who campaigned against Senator Hill; so Senator Minchin's place in the scheme of things is very interesting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is he committed to child care or is he committed to his leader&mdash;a leader who does not want to persist with the quality of care that we strongly support? The only policy that we are clear that Mr Downer wants is to make voluntary the accreditation program that we have established&mdash;to take away the accreditation that we have established and which is welcomed by the users. Mr Downer and the opposition would take away the accreditation and make it merely a voluntary program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are working that out right now. I am pleased that the honourable senator at last understands that we do not have a sufficient number of baby places. As for occasional care, we are actually moving occasional care places to where they are needed&mdash;from places where they are being used for work-related care to other places where they are wanted for occasional care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the baby places, I have talked very often and at great length with the private sector to ask it to take up the baby places. It has not largely committed itself to baby places because that is the expensive end of town and it is not getting into it&mdash;yet.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we are realising that we have an industry now employing some 70,000 people&mdash;a very significant industry, an industry that is actually in the process of maturing. The places are established, quality care is being set in train and we are keeping it affordable. Now it is time to turn to some finetuning and adjusting. I do not have any shame at all about our child care. I welcome the reports and I welcome recognition of just how good this government's child-care program is and how the opposition has fought it all the way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I hope that the minister also welcomes the comments of the former head of the Office of the Status of Women, Ms Sherry, who said, `If banks were treating consumers in the same way that a lot of consumers feel they are being treated by children's services, we would be out on the streets.' There was a budget blow-out of $37 million in the budget for child-care fee relief this year and still the needs of Australian parents are not being met. How can the minister claim, as she did in a letter to the editor in last Friday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, that she supports genuine choice in child care when so many people do not have access to services?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senators opposite can whinge and complain, but the government they left had 46,000 places; we now have 250,000. So there has been a dramatic increase in growth. Certainly, it is not sufficient but we are in the middle of a growth in child-care places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the EPAC report and the quote from Ms Ann Sherry, most of those opposite carry on with the confusion that results from not understanding the points she was referring to&mdash;in particular, the confusion between state and Commonwealth child care, a point that must be recognised. I suggest they read the EPAC report, which gives this government's child care a very high tick, and appreciate that child care is not like banks. We are becoming much more sensitive to what consumers need. Why does the honourable senator suppose we have these reports? I will be listening to and acting on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, my question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories.

Can the minister explain how this will assist China in the battle against drugs in sport and how it will affect Australian athletes in their preparation for the 2000 Olympics?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on 25 October the Australian Sports Drug Agency signed an anti-doping agreement with the Chinese Olympic Committee's anti-doping commission. The agreement was initiated at a meeting I held in Canberra with Chinese anti-doping authorities in July of this year. One of the reasons this very significant agreement was established is the concern of Australian sport with the issue of drugs in sport in China. Rather than be part of the worldwide finger-pointing exercise, it was decided that it would be more constructive to determine what is occurring in China and identify the best way to deal effectively with that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After reciprocal visits between Australian and Chinese anti-doping authorities, officers of the Australian Sports Drug Agency reported to me that they felt that, rather than there being any systemised drug use in China, the problem was similar to all countries where sporting success is important. China has an anti-doping program; however, it does not have an independent agency, such as the Australian Sports Drug Agency, and it has not yet devoted enough resources to deal effectively with the drug use problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, in Australia in 1993-94, 2,800 tests were conducted, 52 per cent of which were out of competition tests. In China in 1993, 1,600 tests were conducted, but only 20 per cent were out of competition tests. It also appears that China has not yet developed an education program to support its testing program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The anti-doping agreement between Australia and China will lead to the following initiatives. Firstly, ASDA will assist China to establish an independent agency based on our model, including a drug testing program with an increased emphasis on out of competition testing. Secondly, ASDA and the Chinese anti-doping agency will continue to work together to ensure the effectiveness of their domestic programs. As well as their strong domestic programs, China and Australia will encourage international federations to implement out of competition testing. Both Australia and China welcome testing conducted by international federations in their countries. In addition, to ensure a strong voice in world anti-doping initiatives, Australia and China will commence work on establishing an Asia and Oceania anti-doping forum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, ASDA and the Chinese anti-doping agency will continue to exchange expert resources to further advance these initiatives. The success of these initiatives will see Australian athletes competing on a fairer basis. They will be able to compete against Chinese athletes knowing that those athletes are exposed to a drug testing program similar to the stringent one in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate my statement to the Senate of two weeks ago. We will certainly take every opportunity to influence international sporting federations in other countries to take action on doping in sport. Australia has an outstanding record in this regard. We will be able to use the opportunity that the 2000 Olympics brings us to convince others that an out of competition testing program should be introduced internationally. We will be more active in a range of international forums that have a role in anti-doping matters. We will pursue further testing agreements with other countries, and we will keep the pressure on.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has not finalised this issue because of a definitional problem concerning radioactive waste, which is being addressed at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ferguson put a question to me and I am proceeding to answer it. Merle Mitchell has all the right in the world to make her comments, but Senator Ferguson is deliberately misunderstanding. Senator Ferguson claims that a person earning a small amount of money becomes ineligible for the HCCA. That is not true. That person is eligible for less than the full HCCA. Senator Ferguson knows that, but he goes out and misrepresents the facts. People can earn quite an amount before they lose the full HCCA.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a small amount; it is about $1,000. It is no different from the arrangement under the dependent spouse rebate. In fact, it is a little more than it was before because people are now getting $30 a week instead of the previous $28.20. Senator Ferguson knows the answer as well as I do. He does not want to know the facts. Everybody who is eligible for the full HCCA is better off, comparing like with like, because the $28.20 is now $30 and because many of those low income people who were never eligible for full dependent spouse rebate because they paid too little tax&mdash;an estimated 50,000 of them&mdash;are now eligible for full HCCA. Do we hear Merle Mitchell and Senator Ferguson talking about that? That is something that the government has done to make people on low incomes, who were previously not eligible for the DSR, eligible for HCCA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge caution in spouting off about HCCA because it very much represents the understanding that existed previously with the dependent spouse rebate, but it increases the payment to everybody who is eligible. It certainly increases the payment to 50,000 families at the low end of the income scale who were not previously eligible for DSR but who are now eligible for full HCCA. As it is prospective, it also means that some 120,000 families, whatever the working spouse's income, are eligible for the home child-care allowance immediately they cease work if they are not earning in the following fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that a few examples have been raised of the way income is treated differently by social security compared with the tax system, and that that has led to a few families&mdash;modest numbers and, on my advice, not the numbers that Senator Lees has indicated&mdash;not being eligible for either full or part HCCA where they were previously eligible for DSR. But the example given by Senator Ferguson is misrepresentative, and he knows that. Those people are not eligible for full HCCA, but they are eligible for some.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws, for instance, that regulate the termination of pregnancy or the production and distribution of pornographic publications do not fall within the definition of `sexual conduct' in the context of this bill. The bill will only affect arbitrary interferences with privacy. The term `arbitrary' has a well understood meaning in international law. Laws which are reasonable and for legitimate purposes are not arbitrary and will not be affected by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obvious that laws against incest, for example, are simply not an arbitrary interference with privacy. All jurisdictions make incest a criminal offence. Such laws are justified on medical and other grounds. They draw an appropriate balance between the needs of the community and the rights of the individual. Each of these terms, I am assured by the Attorney-General, has been carefully examined by experts in international, constitutional and criminal law. We on this side of the parliament are satisfied that the bill would not have the wide and indiscriminate impact that is being feared by the Catholic bishops.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This time last year the parliament had before it a package of legislation which completely restructured the government's approach to the management and sale of the 3.9 million bale wool stockpile which had accumulated under the reserve price scheme. I note media reports today that the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers is now critical of the approach that has been taken and is calling for changes to the legislation relating to the management of the wool stockpile. Can the minister advise the Senate of the government's approach to this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2548" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In November last year the government put into place new arrangements for the management of the wool stockpile. Those arrangements will see over the period of the next four years a reduction in the stockpile to commercial levels and the effective removal of all government involvement in wool industry matters. I would add that the government's decisions were fully supported by the wool industry and, indeed, by the federal opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most fundamental change was the introduction of a fixed schedule for the sale of the stockpile. The key reason for that change was to bring certainty into the wool market regarding the availability of stockpile wool. That decision removed any overhanging effect of the stockpile on the wool market. Since these new arrangements were put into place there has been a remarkable improvement in the wool market. Undoubtedly the fundamental reason for that recovery has been the increased demand for wool as the international recovery has grown.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the certainty that now exists in the marketplace about the sales of stockpile wool has also been an important contributing factor in the building up of that market confidence. The government has absolutely no intention of revisiting the question of the stockpile disposal policy. Any such move would undermine the confidence that is now central to the future of the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that there is likely to be some tightening in wool supply. Based on the current estimates of production for 1994-95 of 735 million kilograms, plus the stockpile sales of 96 million kilograms for the same period, the total supply is well within the normal 800 million to 850 million range. The tightest part of the market will be in the finer wools, and those are wools that are almost non-existent in the stockpile. These circumstances provide a stimulus to the development of more market and commercially based tools for risk management. This has been recognised by woolgrowers, and I commend the efforts of the Wool Council of Australia in actively taking up these issues. The growth in futures trading and forward buying and selling requires a transparent and predictable stockpile disposal policy. I reiterate that the government will not contemplate any changes to this policy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Troeth this day, relating to child care.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Crowley said that she welcomed the reports and comments that have been made over the last few months. I would like to draw some of the salient features of those reports and comments to her attention and then ask her if she still welcomes them. For instance, an article in this month's issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> magazine made the point that, although the percentage of unhappy parents was small, their concerns were quite serious. I say to Senator Crowley that if even a very small percentage of parents find child-care arrangements unsatisfactory or a shortfall in conditions that should be regarded as serious by her and her department. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> comments also went on to say that the industry is at best fragmented and at worst in an absolute mess. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that a loving and caring environment is the most important question looked at by parents when they go to select a child-care venue for their child. We are all conscious that a certain minimum standard type regime as well as constant improvement of the child-care industry should occur. Unfortunately, under the present system quality improvement and accreditation of whatever sort that may be applies only to long day care centres. Those parents who are seeking occasional day care, before or after school hours care or other sorts of care simply do not find that accreditation applies to those centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the National Council for the International Year of the Family said that services were not catering for the growing army of part time, casual and shift workers. We all hope that the present, fairly ironclad industrial relations clauses applying to the work force will one day be deregulated and most economic forecasters point to a loosening up of the work force so that there will be far more opportunity for changing work patterns, part-time work, shift work and casual work, especially for parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both these bodies, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the International Year of the Family national council, reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> on 23 August last that they were surprised by the depth of community discontent. I wonder whether Senator Crowley has taken note of this. In Australia today, there are 490,000 under 12-year-old children who need formal care. Of these, 74.4 per cent are not getting any formal care. They are cared for by friends, relatives or neighbours if their parents cannot undertake their care. The rest&mdash;that is, something like 25 per cent of under 12-year-olds&mdash;receive some formal care but they need more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government stresses its commitment to women and to families, and yet it produces the same old, tired statistics to try to cover up the inadequacies of the present system. The economic regime of the present government means that, in many families, both parents are forced to work for financial survival. Those parents depend on affordable, accessible child care. This should be possible, but it is not being provided under the present system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly encapsulating the many complaints that have been made: there is a significant number of complaints about lack of places, long waiting lists&mdash;the average wait is 4 1/2 months according to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> survey&mdash;little or no access in country areas, unsuitable opening hours and, again, little or no access or very poor access in poorer suburbs and inner city areas. Senator Crowley correctly pointed out that child care is a burgeoning industry. It will receive $1.4 billion in government funding in the next financial year. Senator Crowley's government has had 11 years in which to formulate an accessible, affordable and flexible child-care policy, and it should be doing a lot better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue of child care was dealt with at some length today. Senator Troeth has drawn attention to a number of matters raised in a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> article. Certainly, it is good to see that this sort of issue is now being given the attention that it should have been given for a very long period and was not. This is largely due to a change of community focus&mdash;a change of community focus which has been brought about by the leadership of this government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has given child care a priority which has never been seen before. Senator Troeth referred to a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Choice</EMPHASIS> article. Though it draws attention to complaints that parents have&mdash;I am sure those complaints are valid, and I am sure they can be utilised to make changes which will be advantageous in the future&mdash;the reality is that 91 per cent of the parents surveyed indicated that they are either very satisfied or fairly satisfied; that is, only nine per cent of parents were not satisfied. It would be preferable to have 100 per cent satisfaction, but I would be very surprised if it could be said there was 100 per cent satisfaction with many government services provided or many areas of government policy. I will go further and say that it is unlikely that that has ever occurred in the entire history of Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only six per cent of the parents surveyed indicated that they were extremely critical of child care. I think it is advantageous to examine the difference in priority given to child care by the previous coalition government and the present government. In 1983, when the Labor Party formed a government, there were 46,000 child-care places in Australia. That compares rather unfavourably with the present position, where there are 247,000 places. We might also look at the allocation of financial resources. It gives a reasonably fair indication of the priority that has been given to child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the federal government allocated $63 million to this area. That figure has now increased $960 million. Those opposite need to re-examine their view of reality if they complain that that indicates that this government is not giving a proper priority to child care. This government has done more for child care, more for parents, and more for children in need of child care than any previous government, and far and away a great deal more than the opposition has ever considered doing about child care&mdash;if it ever considered it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of quality has been addressed by the introduction of the accreditation system; a system which now applies to day care and has, with no assistance from the coalition, developed to a stage where it is working extremely well. The coalition's energies might be more constructively used in indicating areas of improvement rather than trying to say that increasing places fivefold is insufficient and that there are major problems with the policy. Maybe the opposition should be a little bit fair and a little bit realistic about its view of child care and accept that this government has done a great deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously there is always room for improvement, but it does not mean that child care is inadequate simply because 75 per cent of people have informal care. The fact that a lot of people avail themselves of informal care is an indication that in some cases that is what is best suited to their situation. The tendency to make that choice, and the need to support that choice financially, has been recognised and acted upon by the introduction of the child-care rebate which provided care, whether formal or informal. I feel very strongly that things can always be improved&mdash;and they will be improved in the area of child care. The government has done very well to date. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In deference to you, Mr Deputy President, I withdraw. I accuse the minister of grossly misrepresenting my position and the coalition's position on this matter. The coalition made it quite clear in the debate on the child-care rebate that we believe it should be means tested. We are unequivocal and unapologetic about that. The government itself knows that its policy on this matter is wrong and that the child-care rebate should be means tested. There were motions at the minister's own state council of the Labor Party calling for it to be means tested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community believes that it is wrong for very wealthy women earning high salaries to receive $60 a week from the taxpayers to pay for their child care. It should be means tested so that the assistance goes to those who really need it. The benefits that would be gained from means testing the allowance should be directed towards improving the home child-care allowance. I am absolutely unapologetic in going around the country talking about the lack of equity and fairness in the government's policy in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is disgraceful that the home child-care allowance, which simply replaces the dependent spouse rebate, is paid at exactly half the rate of the child-care rebate for a mother with two children. It is severely means tested. It starts cutting out at around $240 a year and it cuts out completely at $125 a week; whereas a mother with two children in child care can earn $250,000 a year and still receive $60 a week. We are unapologetic in drawing attention to the gross inequity and unfairness of the government's policies in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the minister who has been dividing mothers of young children in this country. She has been running around the country attacking mothers like Carole Carroll, from Senator Crowley's state of South Australia, who have pointed out the inequity and unfairness of the government's policies. Senator Crowley is the one driving a wedge between those mothers who sacrifice an income to stay at home and care for their children and those mothers who put their children in child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are after in the government's policy is freedom of choice, a fair choice&mdash;a regime of policy which assists mothers with the costs of bringing up children, whether they are bringing them up in their own home or whether they are bringing them up in child care of whatever kind. We want fairness and equity between mothers, whether they are bringing up their children at home or whether they are bringing them up in a child-care centre. It is about time the minister and the government stopped trying to divide these mothers and driving a wedge between them and stopped attacking people such as Carole Carroll and her organisation. Her organisation has spread like a bushfire around this country because of the concern about the government's policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the debate today has been about the government's accreditation guidelines. Again, we are unapologetic about our concern about the way in which these accreditation guidelines have been implemented, about some of the contents of those accreditation guidelines, about the fact that they are compulsory and about the fact that, if people do not comply, they will lose their fee relief as a result of this government's policies. The government is going to take away fee relief if the centre that the children are at does not comply with this government's regime. A lot of child-care centres have grave concerns about some of the contents of these compulsory accreditation guidelines, which many people have pointed out will grossly inflate the cost of child care and make child care more expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that mothers with young children should be assisted with the costs of bringing up children. We have made that quite clear. We do not oppose that; we just believe that it should be fair. We do not believe the government should be introducing policies which, of themselves, will increase the costs of providing child care. All the private child-care centres have said that accreditation will increase the cost of child care for the parents who place their children in those centres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is presiding over one of the most unholy messes in this area. The government keeps adding to the mess. It has an unnamed list of policies. We have family allowance, family allowance supplement, child-care relief, child-care fee rebates and the home child-care allowance. Now we are getting the parent allowance. I do not think the government understands it. I know from government backbenchers that they do not understand it. Their constituents do not understand it. The voters do not understand it. This minister is presiding over one of the most unholy messes in social welfare in this country's history. It is about time she sorted it out. </PARA>

<PARA>The minister, in his answer, tried to whitewash a lot of the recommendations and findings of the report into a complete exculpation of the departments involved and the Australian Labor Party. The minister quoted very selectively. The people of Australia listening to question time may well have got the wrong impression as to what this report and its summary findings actually said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Let us go through some of them. On the length of the term, it says, `Although longer than most leases taken by the Commonwealth.' So the finding tells us that it was a longer lease than most of them. That already raises one question: why was it longer than those for most departments of the Commonwealth? In relation to the rent review clause, it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although on its face the rent review clause appears generous to the lessor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>instead of `lessor', read `the Australian Labor Party and its finances'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the independent evidence is to the effect that it is not unreasonable.</PARA>
<PARA>Note the use of the double negative, which Senator McMullan then tries to turn into a positive. But a finding that it is `not unreasonable' is a bit like a finding of not guilty. It does not necessarily mean that it is a finding of innocence; it is a finding simply that guilt could not necessarily be established. Finding No. 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short term the adoption of the 9% escalation factor has proved advantageous to the lessor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">once again read `the Australian Labor Party'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but this will not necessarily prove to be the case in the long term.</PARA>
<PARA>When the finding says `not necessarily', what it really meant to say was: `chances are it will be for the benefit of the Australian Labor Party.' Then there is a lot of criticism about the departments at the time. The report states, in finding No. 7:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of the lease were negotiated during a period of change in the way in which Commonwealth agencies assumed responsibility for lease commitments entered into on their behalf. The impact of these changes was not sufficiently appreciated by the Australian National Audit Office . . .</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I will speak very briefly to the report because the Australian National Audit Office concluded in this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Taxation Office&mdash;information technology security</EMPHASIS> that overall the Australian Taxation Office is a good custodian of the personal and company information it receives and retains in its computer systems. However, the Auditor-General did make some strong points that, I must say, I am glad to see the Taxation Office has accepted. In fact, it has accepted all of the National Audit Office's recommendations and generally has moved to implement changes during the progress of the audit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that there were some quite serious matters that the National Audit Office drew to the Taxation Office's attention. This is where the improvements have been made. The Taxation Office has mainframe-to-mainframe links to other Commonwealth agencies and operates the child support computer system on a computer belonging to the Department of Social Security. The National Audit Office advised the Taxation Office that it believed the existence of this physical link meant that there was a real possibility of breaches of security occurring, although steps had been taken to limit the potential for such breaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issues arising from the audit included the fact that bulk taxpayer data was held on computers located in branch offices in breach of ATO security policies which required that all taxpayer data should be held on the mainframe production domain. More importantly, data held on network systems is more widely available and less secure than data held on the mainframe. The ATO was increasingly using equipment based on the UNIX operating system, but had no guidelines or standards for security on UNIX. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, special access to production data and programs, termed `firecall', was available too widely and used too frequently. The National Audit Office determined that there were 26,000 uses in two months examined. Change management procedures were deficient and resources used in making system changes were not measured. The present automated tool for tracking system changes, a derivation of an asset management system, is unsatisfactory and the proposal to include change management in a request for tender for a new asset management system is unlikely to produce a suitable solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues were that the most senior security body, the National Security Committee, did not meet for almost two years after being formed, and the ATO had no current approved IT strategic plan, although it took steps during the audit to advance the preparation of a new plan. The last ITSP was published in 1988, before the bulk of the modernisation project was commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this dramatises what a vital job the Australian National Audit Office does. Even where it says, in this case, that the Australian Taxation Office is a good custodian, there are still examples of unnecessary risks being taken. It requires a body like the National Audit Office to have this kind of examination to ensure that these risks are minimised and that there is proper conduct of the affairs of offices, particularly relating to the privacy of Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is bad enough, many people think, to have to pay tax, without running the risk that one's private affairs may well be available for the information of others if appropriate security is not maintained. We have seen instances in recent times of some public servants and some state bodies having been prosecuted for the release of information which is of a private nature. I commend the Auditor-General for his report and encourage him to maintain the high standard of these reports. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing in response to your letter of 10 October, and to the Committee's report on the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, tabled in the Senate on 17 October. I would like to thank the Committee for its detailed consideration of the Bill, and for its helpful suggestions for amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the Committee engaged the services of drafting counsel, and has attached to its report draft amendments which reflect its recommendations.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "The Committee considers, however, that certificates issued in respect of subclause 7(2) which determine that an instrument is not legislative should be expressly deemed to be disallowable instruments. . . . The Committee also considers that if a subclause 7(2) certificate determining that an instrument is not legislative is disallowed, such instruments should be deemed to be legislative. The Committee did not consider that certificates issued in respect of subclause 7(1), which applies to individual instruments made before commencement day, should be disallowable." (page 4)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation, and Government amendments to the bill will be moved to give it effect. I note that the draft amendment in relation to this recommendation does not address the position of any instruments which may have been made in the period between the issue of a certificate, and its disallowance. In keeping with the Committee's recommendation, any such instruments should also be deemed to be legislative instruments, and Government amendments to the bill will provide for a short time limit in which they must be registered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the Committee's concern about the issue of these certificates, a Government amendment will also be moved to ensure that the function of issuing certificates is performed by the Attorney-General personally, and cannot be delegated.</PARA>

(page 4) "The Committee supports the ARC review of [the consultation] aspect of the legislation after three years of operation." (page 5)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will be requesting the ARC to evaluate the operation of the legislation after it has been in operation for 3 years. In particular, it is expected that the ARC will evaluate the backcapturing program which will then have been completed, and will undertake an evaluation of the benefits of sunsetting regimes in practice. The consultation requirements and procedures are an important aspect of the bill's contribution to increasing access to justice, and it is expected that the ARC will give detailed consideration to the effectiveness of consultation, and whether the requirement should be extended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "The Committee recommends that the bill be amended to provide that the regulations may not modify Part 5 of the bill&mdash;Parliamentary Scrutiny of Legislative Instruments, in its application to rules of court." (page 5)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation and will be moving amendments to the bill to this effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "The Committee recommends that the bill provide that the decisions [provided for in clause 17, and subclauses 19(1) and 19(2)] must be contained in the explanatory statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation and will be moving amendments to the bill to this effect. I note that a failure to comply with the requirement will not have an automatic effect upon the validity of the relevant instrument, but will be a matter for the Parliament to consider in its scrutiny of the instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "The bill does not provide for an annual report to Parliament on the operation of the scheme which it proposes. The Committee understands, however, that such a report will be included in the annual report of the Attorney-General's Department. The Committee supports this." (page 6)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the importance of reporting to Parliament upon the operation of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "The Committee accepts that [university legislation which affects the content of academic courses] should be excluded from the general terms of the bill and so recommends." (page 6-7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not accept this recommendation. The Government considers that university legislation, which affects the rights and interests of many thousands of students and staff of the universities, should, if it is within the definition of a legislative instrument contained in the bill, be covered by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft amendment attached to the Committee's report to reflect this recommendation removes "instruments under section 50 Australian National University Act 1991 relating to the content of academic courses" entirely from the operation of the bill. Section 50 specifies a range of matters which may be contained in delegated legislation made by the Australian National University. The "content of academic courses" is not specifically referred to, nor is it clear from the Committee's report precisely what is envisaged by the term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would have great concern that were such an amendment to be made, there would be uncertainty regarding a range of instruments made by the University, which relate in some way to academic courses, as to the requirements for publication and parliamentary scrutiny. Such a level of uncertainty would be disadvantageous to the operation of the University, as it would require an individual decision to be made in the case of every instrument made under section 50, as to whether it would or would not be covered by the exemption, which would delay the process and could leave many instruments vulnerable to challenge, if they are not lodged for registration in the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not consider that coverage of university legislation by the bill will in any way challenge academic independence. In particular, I note that in most cases matters of the actual content of academic courses would appear to be dealt with by means other than university statutes or rules. I also note that whilst an amendment is proposed by the Committee in relation to legislation of the ANU, the Committee does not recommend a similar exemption for university legislation under the University of Canberra Act 1989, which provides in a similar fashion for statutes, rules and orders to be made by the Council and officers of the University of Canberra, and to which the same considerations would apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "The Committee recommends that the bill be amended to extend [clause 27, dealing with the status of the Register and judicial notice of legislative instruments] to include documents printed with the authority of the Principal Legislative Counsel." (page 7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not accept this recommendation at this time. I support the widest possible access to the Register, and my Department is currently investigating a number of possible avenues to provide further access to the Register, in addition to the Australian Government Publishing Service Bookshops, and on-line electronic access from personal computers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of the provision of authoritative prints of legislative instruments is, however, a different issue to that of access to the Register itself. Clause 27 is an evidentiary provision, which allows for judicial notice to be taken of the content and coming into operation of a legislative instrument that is printed by the Government Printer. Such prints are necessary for use only in proceedings, and even then, there are many occasions where courts are happy to take notice of legislation on the basis  of unauthorised versions, such as those provided to practitioners in loose leaf form by legal publishers. Should a court so require, however, it is vital that there be a definitive printed copy of an instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AGPS has in place a printing and distribution system for the provision of prints of primary and delegated legislation. It has a network of bookshops, and various subscription series already in operation, and officers of my Department are discussing with the AGPS the modifications to these subscriptions which the bill will require. Many instruments are currently not published at all, or if so, are available only through the relevant Department. Access to the authoritative prints of any registered legislative instrument through the Government Printer, which has a Charter from the Government to publish legislation, will therefore be a vast improvement on the current situation. It is expected that future review of the AGPS Charter will include consideration of how access to printed material such as legislation could be further improved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "As presently drafted, clause 28, dealing with rectification of the Register, may not permit rectification of a registered copy of a document. The Committee recommends that the bill be amended to avoid this." (page 7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation, and will move Government amendments to provide that a discrepancy between an entry on the Register, and the copy of an instrument lodged for registration may be rectified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "As presently drafted, clause 41, which requires a rule-maker to inform the Principal Legislative Counsel if an instrument was not validly made, would operate so narrowly as to have little meaning. The Committee recommends that the bill be amended to avoid this." (page 7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts that the clause is too narrow in effect. It proposes to move an amendment so that a rule maker will be obliged to inform the Principal Legislative Counsel on becoming aware that an instrument or a provision of an instrument was not validly made. The clause will then operate so that where an instrument or provision of an instrument has been held to be invalid, and the Principal Legislative Counsel is advised of this, whether by the rule maker or otherwise, the Register will be annotated to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note that the draft amendment attached to the Committee's report would extend the operation of the provision so that it was triggered by the rule maker's opinion that an instrument was not validly made. This opinion, however, cannot and should not invalidate an instrument, which is a matter for the courts. In my view, it would not be appropriate for the Register to be annotated on the basis of an opinion formed by a rule maker, which has no legal effect. If a rule maker considers that there is a defect in a registered instrument, which has not been held invalid, then the appropriate method of curing the defect is not for an administrative entry on the Register, but rather for the rule maker to revoke and remake the instrument, as is currently the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation: "As presently drafted, proposed section 46B of the Acts Interpretation Act, dealing with disallowable non-legislative instruments, provided for in Schedule 4, would require complex and repetitive provisions to ensure full parliamentary scrutiny of such instruments. The Committee recommends that the bill be amended to avoid this consequence." (page 7)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts this recommendation, and will move Government amendments to give effect to it, so that a single provision of enabling legislation may provide that instruments made under various provisions are disallowable under the section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two further matters that I should mention. The first is that the Government will also be moving amendments which exempt Proclamations which commence an Act or provisions of an Act from the disallowance provisions of Part 5 of the bill. The Committee was informed of this in evidence from Mr Morgan of my Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the subject matter and nature of this bill are such that it should have the fullest possible Parliamentary consideration. I will therefore be seeking to have the bill referred to a House of Representatives committee for consideration after its introduction into that place. In order to allow for such consideration, the Government will be moving amendments in the Senate to defer the commencement date for the bill until 1 July 1995. Each of the cut-off dates in clause 37 of the bill for registration of existing instruments will also be deferred by 6 months.</PARA>

<PARA>It is interesting to note in the annual report of the Commonwealth Bank that the bank makes quite a feature of the fact that it is a major lender of home finance in Australia&mdash;recognising that the government is still the major shareholder in this bank&mdash;at a time when the government has been saying that there is excessive concentration by banks and other financial intermediaries on home lending. It is quite interesting to see this curious division, or at least dichotomy, of approaches by the Commonwealth Bank and by the Commonwealth's financial advisers. I presume this can be resolved appropriately. No doubt the massive increases in interest rates which we are in the middle of&mdash;we certainly have not reached the end of them&mdash;may well dampen that demand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an inevitability about continuing interest rate rises so long as this government insists on using monetary policy instead of fiscal policy as a way of regulating the economy, and those interest rate rises will have a dramatic impact on the capacity of ordinary Australians running their small businesses and trying to pay off their houses to do either of those things. It is very disappointing for those Australians who are already finding it difficult, who certainly at this stage are not getting the benefit of the recovery which is supposed to be taking place, and who are now facing a significant reduction in many cases in their disposable income as a result of increases in interest rates because the collapse of any sort of coherent government policy has forced the use of rising interest rates as a way of trying to regulate the economy.

I seek leave to move a motion and make a short statement about these reports.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The first report which I have tabled deals with the proposed upgrade of the transonic wind tunnel at the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's Aeronautical and Maritime Research Laboratory, Fishermens Bend, Melbourne, Victoria. The proposal which the committee examined involved the replacement of a range of components to the transonic wind tunnel, including the compressor system and, most importantly, the tunnel test section. The estimated out-turn cost of the proposed work is $12.7 million at December 1993 prices. The committee has recommended that the upgrade should proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought to establish why Australia needs a modern transonic wind tunnel. The need is based on Australia's self-reliant defence policy. The committee concluded that for Australia to continue this self-reliant defence policy it is necessary for capabilities which depend on aircraft and related airborne ordnance to be maintained and further developed. In this general context, it is essential for Australia to have a modern transonic wind tunnel to provide data on aerodynamic loads of aircraft and stores, such as missiles, to permit their more efficient deployment and life extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee heard evidence and confirmed that the existing transonic wind tunnel at Fishermens Bend suffers from small test section dimensions and inadequate compressor capacity. Studies undertaken over a number of years revealed that it would be very expensive to construct a new and much larger wind tunnel to replace the existing facility. The alternative proposal, involving the upgrading of the tunnel and using advances in computing, would reduce cost and at the same time provide a facility which will be adequate for our purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before embarking on the development of the proposed upgrading, DSTO obtained expert advice on its feasibility. The advice confirmed the feasibility and practicalities of upgrading the transonic wind tunnel at Fishermens Bend. Furthermore, the extent of the upgrading of various components of the wind tunnel has been the subject of extensive studies and consultation by DSTO. For these reasons, DSTO is confident that the enhanced capabilities which the upgraded transonic wind tunnel will achieve are adequate for the longer term. The proposal also has the strong support of the Australian aerospace industry and the Australian division of the Royal Aeronautical Society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A proposed consequence of the upgrade of the Fishermens Bend wind tunnel is the eventual closure of a smaller but, from the evidence presented, very effective wind tunnel at Salisbury. The committee received strong arguments for and against the closure of this facility from the Department of Defence and staff associations representing members at Salisbury. On the basis of the evidence presented to it, the committee is unable to endorse the deactivation of the Salisbury wind tunnel, nor is it convinced that it should continue to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For these reasons, the committee has recommended that an independent study of the desirability of deactivating the Salisbury S-1 wind tunnel should be carried out under the auspices of the Australian Science and Technology Council. The committee has also recommended that the membership of the study panel should include experts in the fields of aerodynamics, engineering and financial analysis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report involves the construction of a new Australian chancery complex in Port Moresby at an estimated cost of $22.26 million at February 1994 prices. The committee again draws attention to the continuing difficulty it faces in assessing overseas projects, as under current legislation it is unable to meet outside Australia or its external territories. Until this legislation is amended to enable site inspections to be carried out overseas, the committee continues to reluctantly give approval for construction of projects which, in its view, it has been unable to properly assess. </PARA>

I fully endorse the recommendations of those who are putting forward their concerns about the old building. As was seen in Rabaul, there is always the possibility of an earthquake, and the old building is certainly not up to that. In fact, the structure of the present chancery does not conform to the current design codes for seismic performance. That is what I went there to look at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building requires a major overhaul refurbishment. It does not meet the latest security requirements and was not planned to cater for the present staffing levels and functions of the High Commission. A need therefore exists to provide a new chancery in Port Moresby which will provide a safe working environment. The proposed chancery will comprise the following elements: a new five-level purpose-built chancery; office spaces, display spaces, workshop, storage areas, staff amenities, external plant facilities and services building; a grassed playing area with associated facilities including toilets, showers and change room; staff and visitor car parking; associated site works, services and landscaping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised by the Commonwealth Fire Board that it considered a risk analysis/cost benefit study should be undertaken with regard to fire protection in the new chancery. The committee therefore recommends that such a study be carried out and that the Commonwealth Fire Board and the committee be kept informed of the results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Overseas Property Group advised the committee that, although it did not consider an environmental impact study of the site necessary, it will conduct a review of past uses of the site as well as a munitions search.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS (1994-95 BUDGET MEASURES) LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill presents amendments necessary to implement the remaining part of the Budget package for the Veterans' Affairs portfolio. You will recall that the first part of the package was dealt with by the Parliament in the Winter Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing this package extensive, constructive and valuable consultations with the ex-service community were held by me and my predecessor, Senator Faulkner. These consultations were welcomed by both the Government and the ex-service community and it is my hope that we may continue to work together in the future to provide the best possible care and recognition for veterans and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget package was developed to address the most pressing needs of ex-servicemen and women, war widows and widowers and their dependants. It responded to issues raised by the Hon Professor Peter Baume, Air Vice-Marshal Richard Bomball, and Ms Robyn Layton in their report entitled `A Fair Go'. It also responded to issues raised by other groups in respect of the ageing of veterans of the World Wars, and the different set of difficulties facing younger veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now turn to the specific measures included in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first initiative will affect service pensioners and income support supplement recipients. The treatment of their compensation payments, such as accident, sickness and worker's compensation payments, will be aligned with the way in which compensation payments received by recipients of comparable social security payments are treated under the Social Security Act. This will ensure equitable assessment of income support payments made by both Departments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without going into detail receipt of compensation payments may affect the rate and payability of service pension and income support supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of these provisions is to prevent double dipping. They only apply where a person receives a compensation payment which includes a component for loss of earnings or loss of the capacity to earn and then only if the service pension or income support supplement recipient is under pension age. The new arrangements will only apply to compensation payments received on or after 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pensions that are not for income support are not included in these new arrangements. Already a person in receipt of disability pension or war widows or widowers pension may have the rate of that pension reduced if the compensation payments are paid in respect of the same injury or disease for which the pension is being paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thus, in the case of a person who receives both a disability pension and service pension, any compensation payments which have been used to reduce the payment of the disability pension will not be taken into account again to affect the payment of a person's service pension. Similar arrangements will also apply to a person in receipt of both a war widows or widowers pension and income support supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next initiative provides automatic eligibility for a funeral benefit to be paid to the estate of a veteran who, at the time of death, was receiving extreme disablement adjustment or was a former prisoner of war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a large percentage of such cases a funeral benefit would be paid under the existing rules, but not automatically.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many cases these veterans leave behind a grieving partner, who will no longer need to forward an application in that time of grief, nor will the partner suffer any anxiety about the availability of the benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Automatic eligibility for funeral benefit already applies to certain other groups of pensioners. The addition of these new groups will provide uniformity by granting a funeral benefit in all cases in which an automatic grant of war widows or widowers pension applies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another initiative in this bill will be of benefit to applicants to the Veterans' Review Board. Until now they may have had to meet certain costs of obtaining medical evidence to submit to the Board out of their own pocket. Now they will be reimbursed those costs. They will be entitled to payment of an amount up to $425 for each condition subject to review, as well as an allowance for associated travelling expenses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Already the cost of certain medical evidence obtained by at the primary determining level may be reimbursed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of this change is in response to a recommendation of the Baume Committee. I expect that it will encourage applicants to present their supporting evidence as soon as they can. Currently some applicants appear to withhold evidence until it can be presented at the Administrative Appeals Tribunal because in some cases such costs can be met through Legal Aid grants. By meeting some or all of the costs involved in obtaining this evidence at an earlier stage, it is possible that a decision in favour of the applicant may be recorded earlier. This would avoid the need for many applicants to pursue an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further initiative will allow for the payment of an education entry payment to partner and carer service pensioners and to income support supplement recipients. Education entry payments are paid annually to meet some of the costs of enrolling in a course of study. They assist pensioners under pension age to further their education, thereby improving their employment prospects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The next initiative is of particular benefit to refugees. It will remove the waiting period for service pension for those Commonwealth veterans, allied veterans and allied mariners who were given permanent resident status as refugees. They will no longer need to have been Australian residents for a continuous period of 10 years, nor meet the rules for non continuous periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These requirements are being eased because refugees, unlike other migrants, do not have a choice when leaving their home countries. They also experience greater resettlement difficulties and are less likely to obtain a pension from their countries of origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I am informed that this initiative has been warmly received within those segments of our multicultural society where refugees are represented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another initiative will mean that pharmaceutical allowance will only be paid to a person who is in Australia. Short term absences, however, will not be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in 1990 to compensate pensioners for the cost of prescription items supplied under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and later the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. These prescription items had previously been free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further proposal in this bill affects membership of the Veterans' Review Board. The requirement that a proportion of the members of the Veterans' Review Board be registered or licensed medical practitioners will be removed. This is consequential upon the establishment of the Repatriation Medical Authority and the Specialist Medical Review Council under the first part of the Budget Measures package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Repatriation Medical Authority determines questions of medical causation and prepares statements of principle. These are based on sound medical scientific evidence and exclusively state what factors related to service must exist to establish a causal connection between particular diseases, injuries or death and service. A right of appeal against certain determinations of the Repatriation Medical Authority is available to the Specialist Medical Review Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal does not affect the terms of appointment of the current medical members nor will it alter the total number of members. Persons with medical qualifications could still be appointed as ordinary members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill also contains consequential amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act and other Acts relating to matters dealt with in the first Act of the package.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequential amendments relate to the payment of income support supplement, the payment of `single' rate service pension to widows, widowers and non-illness separated spouses and the integration of Australian mariners with veterans under the Veterans' Entitlements Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, I believe that the measures presented in this bill represent major initiatives which will help to ensure the fair and equitable delivery of repatriation benefits to veterans and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This small portfolio bill contains three amendments to Veterans' Affairs benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its major purpose is to increase the age at which female veterans can qualify for age service pension.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains two other minor measures&mdash;an increase in the maximum rate of the dependent child add-on which is payable to service pensioners for children under the age of 16 years, and the reintroduction of advance pharmaceutical allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to increase the qualifying age for women receiving age pension from the Department of Social Security and age service pension from the Department of Veterans' Affairs was part of the Government's 1993 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation giving effect to this proposal for Social Security age pensions has already been passed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increase in the qualifying age will be slowly phased in with the first adjustment occurring on 1 July 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes that from 1 July 1995 the qualifying age for age service pension for female veterans will be 55 1/2 years. Thereafter, the qualifying age will increase by six months every two years. It will not be until the year 2014 that the age service pension age for women will be 60 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The qualifying age for women will then be the same as the existing qualifying age for men.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second initiative is also part of the 1993 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum rate of additional family payment paid by Social Security was increased by $1.00 per week for each child under 16 years of age. This decision was part of a package to assist low income earners and unemployed persons to offset increases in the wholesale tax announced in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child related payments paid to service pensioners are matched to the rate of Social Security additional family payment. This measure will ensure that the rates continue to be matched by providing that a similar increase will apply to service pensioners with dependent children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final initiative relates to the reinstatement of the payment of advance pharmaceutical allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advance pharmaceutical allowance was paid to chronically-ill pensioners with a high volume of prescription drug use. The advance payment was made from 1991 to 1993. Payments ceased from 1 January 1994 as a result of the operation of a sunset clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A proposal was included in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 to extend the sunset clause for a further year. This bill failed to become operative due to the Senate's refusal to pass the bill in its original form. The disagreement of the Senate was not related to advance pharmaceutical allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initiative in the current bill is to re-introduce advance pharmaceutical allowance payments from 1 January 1995 without the inclusion of a sunset clause. This will ensure that the availability of the advance will be an on-going benefit to veterans and their dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AEROSPACE TECHNOLOGIES OF AUSTRALIA LIMITED SALE BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the planned sale of AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited (ASTA) is a unique step in the Government's micro-economic reform program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of reform in this case commenced in 1986 when, as the Minister for Defence, I approved the formation of ASTA under the then Companies Code. This started the transition of the Government Aircraft Factories (GAF) from an organisation with a narrow defence focus to an internationally competitive company whose prime interest is in the civil aerospace industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA's productivity improvements have been brought about largely by improved work practices and in this regard the Government would like to acknowledge the commitment of the employees of the Company in this transition and the initiative of the new management for its vision and implementation of these important changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA has long term contracts to manufacture important components for the Boeing Commercial Airplane Group and Aerospatiale, a member of the Airbus Consortium. It also has a long term relationship with the McDonnell Douglas Corporation through the F/A-18 aircraft program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of the work carried out by ASTA has been recognised in two ways. Firstly, through ASTA winning awards from the world's prime aerospace companies, such as the President's Award for Excellence from Boeing and by achieving the McDonnell Douglas "Silver" Preferred Supplier Status. Secondly, by being the sole world-wide manufacturer of specific key components for both of these companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It needs to be recognised that ASTA operates in industries that have shown distinct cycles of activity. Both the airline industry and the aerospace industry have been in a trough which has slowed orders for the components that ASTA manufactures and that has seen demand for heavy aircraft maintenance decline as airlines defer this type of work. As these industries come out of the trough there should be significant opportunities for ASTA and its new owner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA currently has an order from the UK Ministry of Defence for 18 Jindivick unmanned jet aircraft&mdash;an aircraft originally designed by ASTA's predecessor, the Government Aircraft Factories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA will work with the preferred tenderer, E-Systems, in the refurbishment of the RAAF's fleet of P-3C Orion maritime surveillance and anti-submarine aircraft. This is a long term project that will bring additional work to ASTA at Avalon and employment to the Geelong region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the formation of ASTA, the Company has established a major subsidiary at Avalon, Victoria. ASTA Aircraft Services Pty Ltd (ASTAAS) was formed in 1988 to conduct major maintenance of wide bodied civil aircraft, such as the Boeing 747.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, heavy maintenance is a demanding industry which is highly competitive. There are significant challenges ahead for ASTAAS as it seeks to capture work emerging from any growth in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government wishes to sell all the Commonwealth's equity in ASTA. Its preference is to maintain ASTA in majority Australian ownership. It wishes to find a buyer, or buyers, able to demonstrate a capacity to provide synergistic benefits to ASTA and able to commit to the ongoing development of a strong, export oriented, domestic aerospace industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Passage of this bill will provide certainty for both current employees of ASTA and for bidders in relation to a number of issues that are important in the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the bill is to ensure that existing Commonwealth legislation applying to ASTA because of its status as a Commonwealth owned entity will cease to apply to ASTA from the sale day. After the sale, ASTA will not, as far as practicable, be subject to Commonwealth legislation which does not govern the activities of private sector companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, there are saving provisions to preserve certain pre-sale rights or obligations, for example in relation to the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983 for acts or omissions that occurred before the sale day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes provision for a separate sale of a subsidiary before the sale of the Company itself should this be necessary to achieve the objectives of the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employee entitlements, such as long service leave and maternity leave, are covered by awards and enterprise agreements that apply to ASTA and ASTA Aircraft Services Pty Ltd. As with any change of ownership these agreements will continue after the sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major part of the bill applies to superannuation arrangements to ensure that no employee is disadvantaged by the sale if they are relying on service with ASTA to qualify for deferred superannuation benefits. After the sale day, the service of employees of ASTA or its subsidiaries, even if sold separately, will continue to be recognised as public employment for the purposes of qualifying for certain deferred superannuation benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For those employees who transferred to ASTA from the Government Aircraft Factories in 1987 and 1988,  the right to apply for jobs in the Commonwealth Public Service as an alternative to taking a redundancy package will cease from the sale day. This is standard practice applied to all Government Business Enterprises when they move into private sector ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes a consequential amendment to the Commonwealth Borrowing Levy Act 1987 so that no levy will be imposed on ASTA's borrowings after the ASTA sale day.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The primary financial impacts of the sale of ASTA will be the offset to outlays occurring when the sale receipts are credited to the Commonwealth Public Account and the return of any surplus in the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme Additional Contributions Trust Fund to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to employees, no further employer contributions will be received by the Commonwealth from ASTA in relation to those employees who are currently members of the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme. It should be noted that employee superannuation contributions are classified as financing transactions and do not affect the Budget outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the cost of monitoring ASTA currently met by the portfolio department (the Department of Defence) and the Department of Finance will cease following the sale and the need for any future call on the Commonwealth, such as for capital, will be eliminated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr resident, this bill puts in place the necessary legislative framework to enable the sale of ASTA to be completed once an acceptable sale agreement has been agreed. It will remove ASTA from the remaining Commonwealth accountability arrangements other than those of a normal company and allow the Company to develop with a new owner committed to ensuring that ASTA continues to play an important role in the Australian aerospace industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, acknowledging the desirability of avoiding any potential for conflict of interest between the private interests and public duty of Prime Ministers of Australia, the following matter be referred to the Finance and Public Administration References Committee for inquiry and report by 1 December 1994:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether existing disclosure provisions for Prime Ministers are credible and whether Prime Ministers should be accountable for their acquisitions of assets and liabilities while in office, and, if so, to whom, and whether the details to be revealed should be similar to those required of ministers under existing Cabinet rules.</PARA>
<PARA>I move this motion because it is now evident that matters of significant principle emerge from controversies that are often  wrongly regarded as no more than base political battles. It is not a coincidence that a code of conduct working group set up under the Presiding Officers has been in operation for some time. Members of that working group come from all sides of parliament. Under the chairmanship of Speaker Martin and President Beahan, the working group was constituted to consider whether new codes of conduct should be adopted by each house for senators, members, ministers and office holders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is evident that honesty cannot be prescribed, there is no doubt that recent instances of abuse of parliamentary standards by parliamentarians in several state legislatures have contributed to public disquiet about the integrity of politicians. This disquiet has not been eased by observations in the book released recently by Graham Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal to establish codes of conduct&mdash;which I understand will come before the chamber in the near future&mdash;quite properly examines questions which have caused concern to the public. While it is evident that it relates to senators, members and ministers, it does not specifically relate to prime ministers. I do not think there is any intention for this, and this is the problem that has emerged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no specific requirement for prime ministers to meet the standards that are required of ministers. Ministers and prime ministers have an additional duty of care to the public of Australia: they exercise considerable power. While this code of conduct working group obviously directs its attention to the proper requirements of ministers, it does not deal with the one loophole that has existed for many years but which has not been a matter of concern because of the way prime ministers have generally conducted themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will indicate the way ministers are accountable to someone for their interests. It is not just a question of their word being taken. They must reveal to their Prime Minister details of their financial situation&mdash;their assets and liabilities. It is quite proper that they should, because when cabinet discusses matters affecting a whole range of areas in which ministers may have, even peripherally, the prospect of getting some benefit, it is vitally important that they be accountable to somebody. That somebody is the Prime Minister. The latest edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> mentions those requirements. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers in the House of Representatives and in the Senate are required to notify the Prime Minister of their private interests (using the House of Representatives form) on an annual basis. The Prime Minister writes to them with forms and explanatory notes each year. This information is tabled in the Parliament and any substantial alterations should be notified to the Prime Minister as soon as they occur.</PARA>
<PARA>And this is the important additional bit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers also submit a supplementary form to the Prime Minister providing him&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think it should be him or her in the circumstances&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">with more detailed information, including monetary values of interests. This information, which is not made public, is updated at the same time as notification is given of alterations to the primary form.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from these formal declarations, Ministers at meetings of the Ministry, Cabinet and committees must declare any private interests, pecuniary or non-pecuniary, held by themselves or members of their immediate families in matters under discussion, where those interests conflict or might conflict with their public duty as Ministers. Any other matter which may give rise to a conflict between duty and interest must also be declared.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . declarations should be made in all cases where an interest exists which could not be said to be shared with the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA>They are pretty wide-ranging requirements. It concludes with:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . should any particular conflict between duty and interest arise during the course of their administration of their departments,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>ministers are required&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to inform the Prime Minister so that it can be decided how the particular matter is to be handled.</PARA>
<PARA>These are clear requirements for ministers to be accountable. We should recognise that the formal documents provided to these two chambers under the declaration of interests legislation can often be meaningless. No amount is indicated. For example, as far as anyone is concerned, holding BHP shares can be equated to a half interest in a public company. No-one could tell the difference by looking at the declaration of interest form. As a result, as I have said here often, the forms are more misleading than informative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the requirement for ministers to reveal all to their Prime Minister means that they are accountable&mdash;and it seems to me properly accountable&mdash;in a forum where serious decisions involving the exercise of power take place. We have seen how ministers must follow those rules, although the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not meet those rules when he failed to advise the former Prime Minister of a specific interest in which he invested $430,000 while Treasurer. The fact that those rules can apparently be broken is not cheering, but at least the rules exist, even if they exist only to be broken. The fact is that ministers are obliged to be accountable to somebody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To whom is the Prime Minister accountable? Himself. Prime ministers have traditionally not taken on additional interests after they have become Prime Minister&mdash;or even Treasurer&mdash;but they have certainly continued with their existing interests. For example, it was always known that Mr Fraser had pastoral interests, and Nareen was bandied around in the other place quite often. It was known that Mr Anthony had had a piggery for many years before coming into parliament. These things were all known. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: to whom does a prime minister reveal that something has been acquired? The prime minister may have exposed himself or herself to risk and created a situation where there is a potential for a conflict of interests, as indicated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>. The cabinet rules specifically say that these matters have to be revealed because they could create a conflict. Do honourable senators notice the word `may' used continually? `May give rise', `which could not be said' and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all conditional. Nothing is proven. It is not a question of whether someone has done right or wrong. The question clearly established in these rules is that, where there is potential for a conflict of interest, that potential must involve the person with that potential being accountable to someone so that that is revealed to someone. In the case of ministers, it is the Prime Minister; in the case of the Prime Minister, it is himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This creates a real problem in a situation where the Prime Minister failed in his former role as Treasurer to reveal to his Prime Minister the fact that he had made a major investment. His failure to meet those rules undermines the fact that there is a problem. There is the potential for a problem: when in fact is the Prime Minister himself requiring himself to tell himself what he has done and how exposed he is? As I said, this loophole, this situation which has never in the past really come up because it never appeared to be a situation where this problem emerged, has now been demonstrated to be one where a problem has emerged. It has the potential to emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns are that a Prime Minister should be no less accountable to someone than any of his ministers. Frankly, I do not know whom that someone should be. There have been suggestions that maybe it should be to the Governor-General. Maybe it should be to the Deputy Prime Minister. In fact, I am very attracted to that concept because it would mean that the Prime Minister would be accountable to someone within the political environment, just as ministers within that political environment must reveal their interests to the Prime Minister. Clearly, we cannot legislate for integrity. We can try to limit the capacity for people to behave dishonestly, but we cannot legislate for it. But, if the cabinet rules required the same level of accountability as those ministers have to meet, I believe we would be at least making it fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the code of conduct working group, which believes this is a sufficient problem to have been meeting for some time on the matter, is aware of the fact that declarations of interest are the subject of procedures laid down by successive governments and guidance to ministers on administrative procedures and requirements pertaining to the cabinet is provided in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS>. It is the Prime Minister who enunciates standards and determines the penalty for any failings of his ministers. Who determines the penalty for any failings by the Prime Minister? There must be sanctions in this sense, and that is one of the reasons there is a need for the Prime Minister to be just as accountable to somebody as his ministers are to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that, when we say that ministers must conform to a set of ethical standards more stringent than those required of members and senators as the justification for these additional requirements, it is clear that prime ministers must also conform to a set of ethical standards more stringent than those required of members and senators, and they must be seen to conform to them. There must be a procedure which applies the same sanctions, the same obligations, the same accountability, to a Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of clear principle has emerged not simply from concerns that some of us may have had about the Prime Minister but also from the various concerns that have emerged from state parliaments where various ministers and even premiers&mdash;or at least a premier&mdash;have shown themselves to be not meeting these specific and high ethical standards that are required of people in public office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has not been an issue in the past. It has become an issue. There is a clear gap in the requirements. That is the reason I believe it would be in the best interests of this parliament and of the standing and status of politicians in general that we follow this course of action and ask the committee to look into the best way of handling what is clearly a matter that merits the attention of the committee and action by this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is just a further manifestation of Senator Michael Baume trying to ferret out, by one means or another, information which is none of his business and which is not a matter of legitimate public interest because it is not based on any reasonable ground for concern. This has not been an issue in the past, as Senator Baume rightly says, but nor is it an issue now. It has not been made an issue as a result of Senator Baume's fruitless meanderings over so many months on the subject of prime ministers, piggeries, St Kevins and anything else that he has turned his lascivious attention to. He has not come up with any grounds for concern in the context of any of these matters that he has been trying to hang around the neck of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), and there is no larger issue of concern which, as a result, demands, requires or needs attention by this parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before us completely misunderstands the basic concepts&mdash;no doubt wilfully&mdash;and purposes of the system that we now have for the registration of interests. Of course it is appropriate that the Prime Minister and every other minister, and now senators as well as members, should publicly register their interests as required by the resolutions of each house. Those requirements for public registration of course do not go to quantitative detail, but they do require the nature of the interest to be identified&mdash;the name of the company in which one has shares and so on. It is sufficient to raise questions of conflict of interest and the potential for conflict of interest if there is any real basis for those concerns. But the detail that is required on the public register has not been thought to be necessarily something that should go further than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any question about the adequacy of the details that have been disclosed on the public register, whether it is by the Prime Minister or anyone else, that is a matter for the relevant house of parliament. In the case of the Prime Minister, it is a matter for the House of Representatives; it is not a matter for the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more quantitatively detailed disclosure that ministers are required to provide to the Prime Minister is part of the internal processes of the executive government. They are not transparent processes so far as the houses of the parliament or the public are concerned. They are internal processes of the executive government. It is, as a result, entirely a matter for decision by the executive government as to how much detailed information is required to be supplied by whom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely appropriate that the Prime Minister, as the leader of the executive government, should require more detailed information of a quantitative kind in order to assist him in particular to make judgments about the proper conduct of executive business, which he of course supervises on behalf of the executive as a whole. That is his job; that is his responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining how cabinets operate, who is appointed to what jobs, and how people should be expected to behave when particular matters come up for discussion in the cabinet room, it is obviously important that the Prime Minister has at his fingertips a degree of detail which it might be necessary for him to have to avoid potential embarrassment for the government. It does not follow that because ministers provide more detailed information to the Prime Minister through these internal executive processes to give the Prime Minister that extra degree of confidence and assurance that he needs in running the government, the Prime Minister himself should be required to disclose that level of detail to anyone else in the system. That misunderstands the nature of the processes that we are talking about here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit I am very surprised that a motion of this kind, trying to treat the Prime Minister in this way, should come from the other side of the parliament because the Liberal Party has always worked on the Fuhrer principle when it comes to leadership of its own parliamentary party and its role in government. The Fuhrer is identified, for better or worse, and the Fuhrer is then entitled to behave like a Fuhrer, exercising all sorts of divine right until such time, of course, as he is knocked off and the next Fuhrer is installed. That has been perfectly well understood. It has been taken to much further extremes in terms of the allocation of cabinet portfolios and so on than we have ever accommodated or been prepared to think about in the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular instance what we are saying is that it is entirely reasonable and understandable, given the nature of the system we are talking about&mdash;which is not a publicly transparent system; it is an executive process system&mdash;that the Prime Minister should be able to be treated in a different way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support this reference because it is an important reference which addresses the question of whether disclosure provisions for Prime Ministers are adequate. It goes to the very heart of the integrity of our political system. We all agree that the political process has to be above suspicion for all politicians. We must all act freely and in the interests of our constituents and the electorate without any pursuit of self-interest or, perhaps just as importantly, without giving the impression or the apparent possibility of being seen to pursue our own self-interest. There should be no conflict whatsoever with our public duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this sentiment which every member of the Senate must support&mdash;and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) has just supported it&mdash;that led to the setting up in New South Wales of the Independent Commission Against Corruption, ICAC, which has been such an important part of public life since the Greiner government took over in 1988. It is this sort of philosophy&mdash;which we all support&mdash;that has led to the introduction of disclosure laws at the initiative of the current government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the importance of the transparency of the political process which we all support: that justice must not only be done but be seen to be done, and that lack of self-interest must not only be there but be seen to be there. If this is true of members and senators at large, how much more true is it of ministers who have greater relevance in terms of their extra powers, financial and otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I am delighted that ministers of the Crown are required to conform to higher standards. Ministers are required to inform the Prime Minister of any interests, business or otherwise, which might be of relevance. This is on top of the general statement in which they annually notify the Prime Minister of their private interests. The information which is publicly tabled in that statement is supplemented by more detailed information about their monetary interests, but that is not made public. The details of the ministers' holdings and interests are made available, as the Leader of the Government in the Senate put it, to the executive government for executive government purposes. We support this and we are trying to make sure this applies to the whole of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue here is that ministers have a much greater opportunity to disburse financial amounts to various groups and bodies; thus it is very important that they be exposed to absolute complete scrutiny. The fact that this is so important is re-emphasised by the fact that gifts above a certain value&mdash;if I remember rightly, a value of $200&mdash;received on overseas trips have to be declared. Every senator in this chamber must join with me in applauding these requirements. Certainly the Labor Party seems to applaud them, as do the Liberals. I am sure the Democrats and the Greens would support them; I know that Senator Harradine, a man of such integrity, would certainly support them. These are good and required standards and they are entirely appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question we have to face here is: what about the Prime Minister of the day? Contrary to what Senator Gareth Evans has said, this is not an issue of piggeries or snouts in the trough or some of the other activities which he raised. Those are absolutely irrelevant to the question here, which is one of broad principle. Trying to dirty the issue by going into a particular senator's behaviour gets past the whole point, which is that we have to make sure that we have the highest possible standards from every member of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question here is: what about the Prime Minister of the day? Does he or she, as the case may be, have the same requirements placed upon him or her as ministers of the Crown? If not, are the requirements placed upon the Prime Minister appropriate, or should they be altered? I have some very clear views about this. I believe that the whole thing should be at arms-length; that there should be independent trustees to manage the assets and business dealings of ministers and, indeed, prime ministers. This is the case in many overseas countries. It has recently been an issue in the United States where President Clinton has been facing the handling of his affairs with some difficulty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Blind trust, as Senator Baume interjects. It is an important way of making sure there is no conflict of interest. Indeed, I am delighted to see that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cabinet Handbook</EMPHASIS> indicates that this is an official view, and I quote section 2.17 as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers are to derive no income through personal exertion other than as Ministers or members of the Parliament and to divest themselves of shares or similar interests in any company or business involved in the area of their portfolio responsibilities; and, should any particular conflict. . . arise. . . to inform the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The question here is: what is the portfolio responsibility of the Prime Minister? As Senator Evans mentioned a few moments ago, the Prime Minister covers absolutely everything. The phrase which Senator Evans used escapes me, but he indicated that the Prime Minister was an overseer of all policy areas. It is very clear that it is important for a Prime Minister to at least make his colleagues aware of any particular interest which he might have which might reflect upon any of the matters being discussed either in cabinet or during any other procedures of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is something which we must surely support. We are not necessarily saying that this should be a public document. It may well be&mdash;indeed it would seem more appropriate&mdash;that it should not necessarily be tabled. I am suggesting that this should be reviewed by the committee so that the committee can make recommendations as to the appropriate procedure; what degree of transparency is needed for the Prime Minister. This is something which surely we must all support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad responsibilities of the Prime Minister mean that the degree of scrutiny placed upon him must be greater than that placed upon individual ministers. The Prime Minister of the day should remove himself from these dealings. What we have to ask now is: What mechanism should be in place to ensure that any particular Prime Minister has no conflict of interest, and is the current mechanism appropriate? Currently, the Prime Minister reports to himself. So, on the face of it, that is entirely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other options. He could report to the Governor-General. He could report to an independent ombudsman of some sort or to his deputy. There is a whole range of different options. I do not wish to put forward a preferred option, but simply say that there must be a defined option so we know that what is happening to the Prime Minister is appropriate and that the scrutiny is of a similar degree of intensity as that which is imposed upon his ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe this reference will ensure that this Prime Minister and, indeed, all future Prime Ministers will be above any criticism of pushing their own self-interests. If we are to improve the standards of this place, to raise the level of integrity and to raise the perception of that integrity, then this surely must be supported by every member of this parliament, not just the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate raised whether this was an issue. He mentioned that it had not been an issue in the past and he claimed that it was not an issue. There are certain differences, because the divestment of business interest was a tradition of Prime Ministers in the past. For example, it is probably common knowledge here that when Menzies retired he had so few business interests and so few assets that his business friends had to club together to buy him a house. He had nowhere to live when he left this place. That is an indication of the lack of business dealings of the Prime Minister of the day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things have changed since then, and I am not necessarily being critical of those changes. But it is now an issue because Prime Ministers who wish to involve themselves in various business dealings have to make sure not only that there is no conflict of interest, but also that there is none perceived. This is a very important issue for the general electorate&mdash;to make sure that there is no cloud hanging over any given Prime Minister at any time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate said earlier that this is part of the internal processes of executive government&mdash;implying that we want to move to some public disclosure of every detail of every asset owned by the Prime Minister of the day. That is not what we are seeking. We are simply seeking for the Prime Minister at least the same treatment that his ministers have to undergo, and have to undergo entirely appropriately. We are not necessarily saying that it should be a public document. My preference is that it probably should not be a public document, but that is something which the committee can decide and report on. As I said, it is not necessarily an important facet of this reference that a public disclosure be made at the end of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans raised the question of why the Prime Minister of the day should be exposed to this&mdash;indicating that he should have more privacy than his ministers. I would take exactly the opposite point of view. The leader of this nation surely must be exposed to genuine scrutiny&mdash;scrutiny perhaps by the public, but certainly by his own government and colleagues. If we say to the contrary, then we are simply saying that the Prime Minister has one law for himself and a separate law for everybody else in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to briefly indicate that the Greens (WA) are supporting this motion. We disagree with the position that Senator Gareth Evans presented, which is that it is not an issue and that it is none of our business. It is quite correct that Senator Evans acknowledged that at any point in time it is the right of parliament to raise questions about the Prime Minister. But it is much better for the parliament to have an appropriate measure of accountability that will prevent allegations and questions without foundation being raised in this place and becoming political.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is in a difficult position, having argued strongly for disclosure and a register of interests of senators and members, which is quite appropriate in my view, when it has then to argue that it is only members and senators who have to disclose their interests and that the higher degrees of disclosure of ministers to the Prime Minister are also appropriate for accountability reasons, but that there is nobody to whom the Prime Minister is accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Independent accountability measures are important. There is grave criticism when the police are seen to be investigating the police. In all other areas, we view with suspicion the accountability measures that are designed internally. The Prime Minister's office is one where those kinds of suspicions are not productive or in the public or national interest. If the Prime Minister needs greater detail of his ministers for his accountability and responsibility reasons, then there is as great a reason for him to have some kind of mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is difficult to address that problem. I am part of a working group which is working in a similar direction. It is trying to devise a code of conduct for members, senators and office-holders. While I do not want to pre-empt the debate that will come up when the results of that committee's operation are debated in the Senate, my experience in working on that committee is that it does not overlap the need for this reference. It is doing a very constructive and helpful job of assembling some guiding principles that are applicable to everybody. My understanding is that they are also applicable to the Prime Minister because they deal with office-holders of every kind, including party leaders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limitations of that committee, which have been noted, are the ones that become relevant when we consider the reference of this topic to a parliamentary committee. In relation to the code of conduct of members of parliament, because it is a parliamentary meeting, it is clear that it is not a parliamentary committee. There are no public hearings. There is no parliamentary privilege which applies to submissions and the inquiry is not able to respond to individual and specific issues. So there is a good case for saying that, to complete the picture and to remove any grounds for concern about conflict of interest, it is appropriate to have measures of accountability that we can apply to the highest office in the land. I support Senator Bourne's amendment because I agree that, within a very short time frame, if an election occurs, a leader of the opposition may become the Prime Minister. </PARA>

If it has to apply equally to the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition in the light of that possibility, that should reassure the government that any measure will be designed on a balance and not on a party political basis. I certainly do not support anything that would be on a party political basis; but I do support something that assures the wider community of Australia that no-one in this country is unaccountable and that, certainly, the highest office-holder in the land does not escape from that degree of scrutiny and accountability that he gives within his own cabinet to his own ministers. </PARA>

It was open to me, for example, to insert, `and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, so long as they maintain their status as a party' after the words, `Leader of the Opposition'. That would be equally absurd. I am not going to do it. The Australian Democrats, I presume, will not have the opportunity of exercising their power in an executive sense; but they certainly do have the opportunity to exercise their power in a parliamentary sense, as both the government and the opposition know only too well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion moved by Senator Margetts. As I have outlined in my dissenting report to the report of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, it is not sufficient for the government simply to draft these revised regulations as outlined in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important point is that by section 7A&mdash;which was placed in the act in 1992 against the objections of the Australian Democrats&mdash;ANSTO has been given immunity from relevant state laws governing land use, planning, the conduct of hazardous activities and the protection of workers' public health and environmental safety. That means that the treatment and transporting of nuclear waste is done in a way which could put at risk members of the community at and near St Marys and on the way when the material is being transported. I think it is totally inadequate to allow this work to proceed without providing the community with the protection that it deserves.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking here about a couple of boxes of matches, we are talking about nuclear radioactive material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also quite wrong to state, as was stated during the inquiry by one of the witnesses, that the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority could be relied upon to assist in supervising these transactions. What is quite clear is that section 7A of the act excludes the EPA from doing precisely that. The EPA has no role in supervising what happens to the nuclear waste. It is on that basis that the Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe there is absolutely no reason why the government cannot overcome this particular difficulty by an amendment to the principal act. If all parties agree&mdash;and I find it difficult to believe that any party in this house would be sanguine about depriving the community of these safeguards&mdash;an amendment to the act could be passed within 24 hours. So why not proceed on that basis instead of going through all the contortions and arguments about the legality or otherwise of a regulation, and whether the power of the act provides a basis for these regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some doubt about one of the other regulations which the government is now prepared to draft even though the government strenuously opposed it during the committee hearings. There is clearly no possibility of drafting a regulation as I have suggested to suspend for this operation the immunity of ANSTO from state safety and health regulations. But as I said, there is no reason whatsoever why the act cannot be amended so that the immunity is lifted just for this operation. If that were done, the Australian Democrats would not support the disallowance motion. But since no move has been made by the government, and following inquiries to the minister's office which I made earlier today there was a very clear statement that the government would at this stage anyway not consider such a move, the Australian Democrats will be supporting the disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The referral to the Senate committee seems to have served a very useful purpose. Mr Deputy President, you will recall that when the matter was last before the Senate there were differing views as to whether or not the regulation could be drafted in a more restricted form. We had expressed concerns on that occasion that the regulation that we were being asked to support would in fact allow ANSTO and the government much greater discretion in relation to treatment and transport of nuclear waste than what the government said was the purpose of the regulation. In particular, the government claimed that the purpose of the regulation was to allow it to remove waste from St Marys in Sydney to Woomera for temporary storage and, if it proved necessary, to transport some of that waste from St Marys to Lucas Heights to be put in a safer form for transport across Australia to Woomera.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation that we had before us, it seemed to us, would enable the government to transfer any waste to Lucas Heights, which is something that we thought would be undesirable. Certainly at the beginning of this negotiating period it was unlimited in time&mdash;so this was an ongoing facility that was being sought by the government when in fact that was not what was being claimed was wanted&mdash;and it could relate to other than St Marys waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our position was that we accepted that the material that is at St Marys should be removed from the suburbs of Sydney, and we have reluctantly accepted that it be stored temporarily at Woomera. You will recall, Mr Deputy President, that our argument has been that the government should provide the permanent facility repository that it has been promising for a long period, and that is where the waste should be headed. But it has not kept that promise, and such a facility does not yet exist, and there is urgent need to remove it from St Marys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned about the need to transport it to Lucas Heights for further conditioning. We had trouble with the government's argument that it might be unsafe to transport it from Sydney to Woomera, but it is apparently safe to transport it from St Marys to Lucas Heights for further conditioning, the argument being that the facility for processing or in some way making that waste safe for a longer journey is only located at Lucas Heights. But we do recognise that there is a problem here. We said from the start that if the government were to be cooperative and drafted this regulation in a form that met our concerns&mdash;in other words, the government would be restricted to the purpose for which it claimed it wanted the extra regulatory power&mdash;then we would support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Senate committee Professor Pearce gave helpful evidence which in the end, it seems, was accepted by the majority of the committee, although Senator Spindler is saying that during the course of the inquiry the government representatives may have argued against its acceptance. Nevertheless, that advice was accepted. The effect was that the regulations could be redrafted to define the radioactive waste that can be conditioned, managed and stored by ANSTO as the waste that is stored at St Marys on 1 November 1994. I understand that the government now accepts that and by its letter dated 8 November, under the signature of Senator Cook, has said that it is prepared to introduce an amending regulation if the Senate votes against the motion of disallowance:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is proposed that the amending regulation which will cease on 31 December 1995 will be restricted to conditioning of the waste material located at the St Marys site as of 1 November 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, the government has accepted that it is valid to draft a regulation with that restriction and has given an undertaking to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has further said in the letter that it will continue the promise that it had given earlier&mdash;namely, to accept a sunset clause which means that waste must be treated and dealt with by 31 December 1995. We think that is in the interests of Sydneysiders. Although Professor Pearce advised that it would not be possible by regulation to deal with the issue of the transfer to Lucas Heights, the government has said that it would be prepared to give notice to the relevant local government authorities and to us&mdash;in other words, to the parliament&mdash;of its intention to transport the material to Lucas Heights, if it turns out that such transport is necessary. We think that is a not unreasonable compromise in circumstances where we also want to get the material out of St Marys to Woomera as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reservation that we have concerns the issue of transporting the material from St Marys to Lucas Heights. We would prefer that that not occur. There is, however, a dilemma that we accept. If the material can only be made safe for the long journey by a process that is available only in Lucas Heights, we accept that it will have to be transferred to Lucas Heights for that purpose. We have undertakings that that option will be adopted only if there is no other alternative&mdash;in other words, that material will not be transferred to Lucas Heights if there is another alternative. The preferable alternative clearly is that it be made safe for transport at St Marys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could have supported the motion for disallowance and therefore stopped ANSTO from having that option to transfer the material to Lucas Heights, but it seemed to us that was rather futile because the government could by a private contractor transport the material to Lucas Heights where ANSTO would be able to deal with it. There did not seem to be much point in continuing to pursue that argument. So the compromise whereby the local communities will be advised of any intention and have time to take such action as they might think appropriate&mdash;which presumably in the case of the local authorities includes political action&mdash;we think is a quite positive achievement out of what has been a relatively long and difficult negotiating process with the government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly the people of Sydney will have the advantage of getting this material out; they will not suffer the risk of further material being brought in. They know that ANSTO will be limited to dealing with the material at St Marys, and that if it has to be transported to Lucas Heights they will have notice of such intention to transport. In all those circumstances we are now prepared to allow this regulation to stand and will not be supporting the motion of disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For similar reasons I do not feel disposed to continue my support for the disallowance motion. It is indicative of the merits of the committee system that these matters were able to be discussed in such detail. One thing that concerns me is that the government has not acted to bring in an amending regulation. However, no doubt if it does not do so forthwith, the Senate can revisit this matter in a substantive manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as poor old Woomera is concerned, about the time of the atomic tests I was working on the railways to Alice Springs and to Kalgoorlie and a relative of mine lived near Woomera. He has in his possession details of the way the wind was blowing and also a note that the radio bulletin said with great confidence that the wind was blowing in a certain way, when in fact it was blowing in another way. I have had a great deal of suspicion ever since in regard to these matters, which are matters of life or death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In talking of life or death issues I am also conscious  of the importance of nuclear medicine in various areas. I am diverting a little from the matter at issue, but I raise that matter because the government has not determined on a permanent site for this waste material. We should keep on the government's hammer in regard to that. Who knows&mdash;there may be somebody who is yet to be born or somebody now who will come up with an invention that will ensure the most effective means of disposing of this waste that has not yet come about. When I say `most effective', I mean most permanent and in the safest manner. No disposition of this material will be entirely safe as the state of technology now is. I urge the government to attend to that matter and keep reporting to the Senate on how it is going with the task of finding a permanent position for the disposal of this waste in the most effective manner that is available. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you on behalf of the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology who, as you are aware, is ill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Margetts has given Notice of Motion to disallow the Regulations under the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO) Act 1987 presently before the Parliament. I trust that the Opposition would support the Regulations as gazetted, should Senator Margetts not withdraw her Motion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to confirm that the intention of the Regulations is to enable ANSTO, as the Commonwealth's specialist nuclear technology arm, to undertake the work of conditioning a quantity of radioactive wastes presently stored at the site of the former St Marys Munitions Factory in western Sydney. The wastes arise from various past activities of the Commonwealth and are managed by Australian Defence Industries (ADI) on behalf of the Department of Defence. The wastes must be moved to allow ADI to clear and redevelop the site as it proposes to consolidate its operations elsewhere. Conditioning will immobilise the wastes to make them safer for transportation and ANSTO is the appropriate body to undertake the conditioning. It is intended that the wastes will be conditioned at St Marys.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that you may have some reservations that the Regulations, as gazetted, do not restrict ANSTO to this specific waste. The ANSTO Act requires that the Regulations specify persons on whose behalf ANSTO may undertake the conditioning, management and storage of radioactive materials and radioactive waste. The Regulations are necessary if ANSTO is to be permitted to undertake any of these activities in respect of the waste at St Marys, irrespective of the radioactive materials or wastes concerned, their origin, or the site at which the activities are to occur. The Act contains no provisions to limit the application of the Regulations to particular activities, materials, wastes or sites. The Attorney-General's Department has advised that the present form of the Regulations is correct, given the requirements of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An effect of the present Regulations would be to permit ANSTO to undertake similar work on behalf of the Commonwealth should such a need arise in the future. A list and description of Commonwealth/State radioactive waste holdings is attached. This list is taken from the National Resource Information Centre's Phase 1 Report on A National Radioactive Waste Repository for Australia (1992).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note that, apart from the waste at St Marys (which amounts to approximately 10 cubic metres by volume), the only other Commonwealth waste to which this Regulation could be applied is the remainder of the Defence waste (about 50 cubic metres).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to confirm the assurance I gave you earlier today that the current Regulation is not intended to authorise conditioning of the remaining Defence waste, but should a need arise&mdash;for example, for transport to the proposed national low-level radioactive waste repository when it is established&mdash;then the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology will consult with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate prior to any action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, separate regulations will be needed if ANSTO were to undertake such work on behalf of other legal entities, such as Commonwealth statutory authorities or State government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is possible that some of the waste at St Marys will need to be transferred to ANSTO's Lucas Heights Research Laboratories (LHRL) for treatment in the specialised facilities at that site, although I am advised that this is considered highly unlikely. Nevertheless, you have my assurance that should this happen, the wastes will be held at LHRL only for the time necessary for conditioning and will be returned to St Marys as soon as possible. Similarly, should any of the remaining Defence waste require conditioning at LHRL in the future, we would ensure that it will only remain there for the time necessary for conditioning. As you would be aware, it is proposed to move the St Marys waste to the Woomera Rangehead for interim storage, a move which on present indications is likely to be completed by the middle of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your endorsement of the Regulations would be appreciated, as ANSTO will be unable to undertake any action in respect of the waste at St Marys if the Regulations are disallowed. It would be a perverse approach to the safe management of the waste if action is taken by the Senate to disallow the Regulations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I will not speak for long on this matter, but I want to mention that I had heard there was some kind of implied or specific threat from the government in relation to bringing in a private contractor if the government did not get its way in this regard. I would like to express my horror at that method of negotiation because the level of accountability in relation to such things as the transport of nuclear material was being very deeply discussed. We discussed in detail the fact that ANSTO and ADI through this process, because they could not reach the standards that had been set or promised, were given exemption from the normal rules, regulations and laws of the states so that they could continue their operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were a private contractor, what kind of scrutiny would there be? Would that contractor also be exempted? Perhaps we should have let it go ahead. Perhaps a private contractor would have been subject to the kind of public environmental scrutiny that is missing from this process. That is something I would like to throw into the ring on behalf of the public. Those exemptions remove bodies further from public accountability. What kind of built-in safeguards do the public have and what kinds of responsibilities does this show the government is enacting on this kind of serious matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to express my surprise that the first recommendation of the committee is contrary to recent precedent in this place with respect to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. I remind committee members that on 17 October 1994 the Senate passed a motion that rescinded a disallowance of regulations under the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993 `to allow a new regulation to be made which would be the same in substance as the disallowed regulation'. I can only wonder whether there is another reason for not wanting these regulations disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to acknowledge the work of the committee in coming up with a proposal to amend the current regulations to at least partly address the concerns of the community in relation to the proposal to condition the waste at St Marys and transport it to Woomera. I must say, however, that the amended regulations will not be sufficient to satisfy the concern of the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There remains a fundamental concern about the increased risks associated with the handling and transport of nuclear waste at St Marys. There is no question that, from a risk management perspective, this increased risk is not offset by any lessening risk at the ultimate destination at Woomera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The St Marys site, to my understanding, is well protected and the waste is securely stored in above-ground concrete bunkers. The Woomera site, to my knowledge, is not acknowledged by the government as the site for a permanent nuclear waste repository. I can therefore see no logical reason why the waste at St Marys should be moved at this time, when the government is supposedly moving towards the establishment of a permanent nuclear waste repository site. This has been mentioned by other speakers. As a consequence, it is my contention that these regulations should be disallowed and any decision to move the waste at St Marys should be delayed until the completion of the government's consultative process in relation to nuclear waste storage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, Senator Newman's proposed reference to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee relates to the death of Royal Australian Air Force Flight Lieutenant Glen Donovan in the crash of the Nomad aircraft A18-401 on 12 March 1990 and a subsequent Ombudsman investigation and report. There are several issues of concern arising from this damning report that require investigation by the defence and foreign affairs committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been drawn to the attention of the shadow defence minister that, because of the long delays since this tragedy, the relatives of Flight Lieutenant Donovan are unable to seek legal remedy against some Defence Force personnel and government instrumentalities who may well be guilty of negligence. They have certainly been severely criticised in the Ombudsman's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, legal action by the family is further limited because under the Defence Force Discipline Act there is a statutory bar after three years for disciplinary action by the Defence Force itself. It has to be questioned whether the criminal law might still be applicable in instances such as these so that people guilty of gross negligence could be charged if appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This reference will investigate what amendments, if any, could be made to the Defence Force Discipline Act 1982 to ensure that statutory time limits should not operate in the future to prevent disciplinary action. It will also allow the Senate to investigate whether the interests of the deceased pilot and his family have been adequately supported by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, has failed to table this report. Senator Newman did so on 12 October. The reference will also look at the failure of anyone to pursue the question of individual responsibility for actions contributing to the failure to detect the dangerous condition of the Nomad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the Ombudsman, in his report, made less than favourable comments about a number of government bodies. In relation to the RAAF, the Ombudsman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the RAAF did not go far enough to attribute individual responsibility for the deficiencies found and gave inadequate consideration to the question of disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that it is extremely important to clear up the legal question relating to holding people accountable where they have been negligent in the pursuit of their duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the government aircraft factory, the GAF, the Ombudsman found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GAF's design of the tailplane was defective. The tailplane failed to meet Australian Civil Certification standards. The defect was known to GAF as early as 1981-82 . . . GAF failed in its responsibility to adequately advise the RAAF, Defence and the CAA of the extent of the problem and the remedial action necessary to bring the aircraft back to certification standard. In fact, the GAF appears to have deliberately withheld information in order to obscure the extent of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The Ombudsman also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GAF also failed to substantiate its hypotheses about the causes and growth of cracking or to undertake fatigue analysis of the tailplane . . . GAF continued to advertise the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Nomad</EMPHASIS> as having a fatigue life in excess of 30,000 hours&mdash;when in fact no fatigue life for the tailplane had been established.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd, ASTA, the Ombudsman found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA did not maintain <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Nomad</EMPHASIS> A18-401 in an airworthy state in accordance with the terms of its loan contract with the RAAF . . . ASTA failed to recognise the servicing required at the end of its program of running the aircraft's engines while on the ground . . . ASTA failed to prepare a Condition Acceptance Report at the expiry of the loan . . . ASTA's . . . failure to substantiate its understanding of the causes of the cracking significantly increased the final cost to the Commonwealth for its remedy&mdash;now estimated by the Department of Defence to be in excess of $6,000,000 . . . ASTA failed to respond to the airworthiness issues set out in letters from the CAA in June 1989 concerning the origins and nature of the tailplane cracking.</PARA>
<PARA>The Ombudsman gives ASTA credit for pursuing the causes of tailplane cracking since the crash and for designing and installing modifications to resolve the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority, the CAA, was the next government instrumentality to come under the microscope. The Ombudsman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite a decade of unsuccessful modifications carried out by the manufacturer (GAF), the CAA failed to obtain from ASTA a full explanation of ASTA's understanding of the causes of cracking . . . The CAA, having received a Major Defect Report on a <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Nomad</EMPHASIS> aircraft nine months before the crash of A18-401, failed to take proper and responsible action to obtain answers from ASTA. As a result of this failure it was in no position to act to maintain <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Nomad</EMPHASIS> air safety and in consequence precluded itself from preventing the loss of A18-401 . . . Since the crash, the CAA has actively pursued its responsibilities, to ensure that ASTA understands the problem . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The reference will also investigate whether the reports of the Ombudsman of this kind should not be tabled in both houses of parliament as expeditiously as possible. This is an integral step towards ensuring accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's dalliance in tabling this report, I believe, has been inappropriate. On 27 June 1994 Mr Bill Taylor, in the other</PARA>
<PARA>place, made a short speech, saying that he expected the report to be tabled within a week. It was not. The then shadow minister for defence, Mr Peter Reith, wrote to Minister Ray on 30 August, saying that he had received representations from the family of Flight Lieutenant Donovan seeking to have the report by the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman on this matter tabled in the parliament and that the family believed that this would be appropriate recognition of the significance of the report and its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital that airmen&mdash;in fact, all Defence Force personnel in this country&mdash;are afforded the best equipment and back-up available as their jobs are important and already highly dangerous.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support the reference that Senator Newman made. I take a very solitary view of any reference on defence matters because over the years I have noticed that the Australian Democrats and Greens never even listen to the argument and automatically vote for it on the basis that anything they think can harm defence is a good idea. I have been through that and suffered deja vu on that, so I will not press that too much.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole issue of the Nomad crash that Senator Sandy Macdonald referred to has been exhaustively examined by air safety boards and by the ombudsman, so it is hard to understand what a Senate inquiry, with its lesser amount of expertise, could turn up in that process. I note that the terms of reference have altered the date for reporting. Originally they were going to do a full inquiry into the Nomad crash and all its ramifications and report back by 5 December. Good luck is all I can say to that. It took the ombudsman two years. That date has now been extended, I think, by about four months. Again, it will be good luck if a committee inquiry looks at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ombudsman's views have been, of course, selectively quoted here to support the case. The ombudsman also said there was no cover-up and went into a lot of other matters, which are on the public record.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Nomad was one of the last 14 Nomads transferred to the Australian defence force in late 1987 from stock held by the former Government Aircraft Factory (GAF)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">now the wholly owned government business enterprise, Aerospace Technologies of Australia (ASTA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was one of two used Nomads which was assigned to the Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) at Edinburgh in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of this transfer decision, the two used aircraft were being operated by ASTA in product improvement trials. The aircraft that subsequently crashed, had been built in 1982 and used by GAF for various trials, accumulating just a few hundred hours in flight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, unusually, that aircraft had undergone extensive ground running of the engines, perhaps accumulating as much as half again the number of flying hours.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA requested a loan back from the RAAF of the two used aircraft to continue the trials program. This was agreed and ASTA maintained the aircraft as though they were civil aircraft throughout these trials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence took deliver of the older aircraft in March 1989 and subsequently the accident aircraft in August 1989. Both were flown from the factory at Avalon direct to Edinburgh as military aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that military Nomads are maintained differently to civil Nomads, generally by inspecting and replacing components more frequently because of the more severe usage associated with military operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On arrival at Edinburgh the first aircraft was serviced and because of the large number of flying hours, the cost of restoring this aircraft to RAAF standards was judged to be prohibitive. It was not flown again, and has since been written off.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The apparent condition of Nomad 401 was much better. The aircraft and engine log books revealed the relatively low number of flying hours and that the aircraft had completed a major servicing at ASTA just 11 flying hours before RAAF acceptance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aircraft was flown by ARDU pilots between August 1989 and March 1990 on familiarisation flights. It accumulated just nine more flying hours but a propeller unserviceability required nearly six more hours of ground running.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the RAAF maintenance system, if a Nomad has not had a major inspection within the last 12 months, a special servicing is required to check for deterioration. On the 6 March 1990 Nomad&mdash;401 became due for that special servicing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of a misunderstanding by maintenance staff, the servicing was not carried out. Two RAAF pilots flew the aircraft on the morning of 12 March and reported no problems. Flight Lieutenant Donovan then continued to fly the aircraft alone until the tailplane failed in flight and the aircraft crashed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After the crash an RAAF accident investigation team (AIT) was appointed within hours of the crash to investigate the wreckage and determine quickly whether any endemic airworthiness problem existed. The investigation team included a professionally trained RAAF aircraft accident investigator and a Bureau of Air Safety investigation inspector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was immediately apparent that the aircraft tail section had broken away in flight. Within 24 hours all Nomads, both civil and military, were grounded. The AIT concluded its investigation 15 days later, finding, amongst other things, that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">neither the pilot nor environmental factors such as the weather were causal factors in the accident;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the obvious cause of the accident was the separation of the empennage (that is, the tail section) from the aircraft, caused by structural failure of the horizontal stabiliser carry-through box; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there was no evidence that the structural failure was caused by exceedance of the aircraft's design limits during the final flight.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The investigation team concluded that the tailplane spar assembly of Nomad 401 had been extensively cracked before the last flight, and that these cracks would have reduced the strength of the tailplane sufficiently to cause failure under normal operating loads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Extensive ground running by ASTA was carried out prior to handover of the aircraft to ARDU. In the absence of any other unusual event, the accident investigation team speculated that the cracking of the carry through box was exacerbated by the extensive ground running, but recognised that further testing would be necessary to check this hypothesis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was found that the handling of the aircraft's documentation, including its servicings, modifications and special technical instructions by ASTA and the RAAF during the transfer of ownership and subsequently loan back to ASTA was less than satisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this, coupled with less than adequate direction from higher command, culminated in ARDU operating Nomad 401 without the extensive cracking in the tailplane being detected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accident investigation team recommended that the air force be tasked to initiate testing to establish the loads experienced by the Nomad tailplane during engine ground runs, and that the data derived be used to ascertain the speed of propagation of cracks in the tailplane. As well, the AIT recommended that, if that testing so indicated, a policy regarding the ground running of Nomad aircraft be formulated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There were other recommendations to establish the history of all Australian defence force Nomads and audit all relevant documentation for errors, omissions and anomalies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The day after the crash a RAAF Board of Inquiry (BOI) was convened to look into all aspects of the accident. It took evidence from 49 witnesses, including the investigation team members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The BOI was given 32 terms of reference, covering the primary and contributory causes of the accident and any aggravating conditions. The board was also required to report whether any person involved was guilty of negligence or in any other way to blame, or made an error of judgement, or contravened any order or instruction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original board president appointed on 13 March, a squadron leader, soon identified that there were implications for persons above his rank and so, in accordance with RAAF legal procedures, a new board president at group captain rank took over. Within a month, the board had taken evidence, not only from the RAAF but also from ASTA personnel, regarding the accident and the treatment of the aircraft during its life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The president presented to the Air Commander of Australia, a 48 page report which analysed the evidence and provided the reasoning for the board's findings and recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report stated that the primary cause of the accident was the aircraft commencing the flight with extensive cracking in the horizontal stabiliser box beam. This cracking weakened the box beam to the point where it could not sustain normal inflight loads. As a result, the box beam failed in normal flight. The resultant rapid fracturing allowed the whole tailplane to separate from the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A list of possible aggravating conditions and comments on the blameworthiness or otherwise of individuals were contained in the statement by the board and its conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report was passed to the Air Commander on 12 April 1990, just a month after the accident. Apart from the legal aspects of the report, clearly the Commander had some major technical and procedural engineering problems to grapple with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the Air Commander's request, the Chief of the Air Staff directed an independent assessment of the engineering circumstances, which was completed in May 1990. This further substantial report confirmed the primary cause of the accident and noted some shortcomings in the RAAF policy and procedures for acquisition of used aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also confirmed that there were individual errors which may have led to opportunities to detect the unairworthy condition of the aircraft being missed. At that time the reason why the tailplane had cracked in the way it did could not be positively ascertained, as extensive testing of an instrumented tailplane was yet to yield results.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendations by the Board of Inquiry and the independent assessment were generally accepted by the Chief of the Air Staff who directed remedial action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That action has been completed except for the formal issue of RAAF's airworthiness manual, publication of which is imminent. This manual provides guidance for the certification and release of aircraft new or used into service, and for action needed to ensure continuity of airworthiness requirements when ADF aircraft are loaned out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that it is important to note at this point that some cracking in Nomad tailplanes was a well known characteristic which was controlled by periodic inspections and replacement of horizontal stabilisers. Experience had shown that inspections were sufficient if performed every 100 flying hours or so, and typically an aircraft flew many thousands of hours before the horizontal stabiliser had to be replaced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What was incredible to airworthiness experts was that the tailplane on NOMAD 401 had failed completely just 20 flying hours since it was last inspected, and after only a total of 433 flying hours since manufacture. Only later testing of the ground running loads revealed how severe this mode was in damaging the Nomad horizontal stabiliser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Testing of the Nomad structure is continuing, but the propensity of the original design to crack as a result of fatigue has been confirmed, and a much improved design has been developed. The modification has been issued at no cost to all Nomad operators worldwide. Testing of the improved tailplane has proven the durability of the modification, although regular inspections are still required by the civil and military airworthiness authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These actions were well in hand when the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman was, in 1991, requested by Mr Philip Donovan, the brother of the pilot, and my office to investigate the adequacy of the RAAF response to the loss of Nomad A18-401.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman's draft report was distributed in 1993 to all organisations and individuals criticised, directly or impliedly, for comment in person or writing, before finalising the report. GAF, ASTA, CAA and RAAF employees were implicated. My department gave all of those defence employees, whether still serving or not, the opportunity to respond through the defence submission. Most did and a consolidated reply was sent to the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think it would be fair to say that the replied materially assisted the Ombudsman, who acknowledged the contributions in subsequent correspondence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence addressed numerous technical details and accepted the recommendation to review the legal implications for some defence employees. Many of the department's comments were adopted in the final report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand the Ombudsman's draft report was the first opportunity for most to see all of the information obtained from ASTA and the CAA: these organisations were also criticised. In summary, the overall defence reaction was one of satisfaction that the Ombudsman had confirmed most of the findings of the accident investigation team, the Board of Inquiry and the independent engineering assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there was, and still is, a difference in views about the judgement of culpability of defence employees, the need for disciplinary or administrative action, and the practicability of pursuing such matters beyond that already undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board, which was responsible for recommending any disciplinary action concluded that such action was not warranted. Nevertheless, the Air Commander paid particular attention to this aspect and formed his own conclusions which, ultimately accorded with those of the board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He fully understood that grounds existed for charges under the Defence Force Disciplinary Act to be laid against the two ARDU personnel whose actions led to the scheduled special servicing not being undertaken. However, he concluded that those actions were not negligent but, instead, were honest human errors of judgement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, the appointing authority was also cognisant that, while the errors of judgement of the ARDU personnel caused the last opportunity to discover the unairworthy state of the aircraft to be missed, the causal chain for that unairworthy state, however, extended back through much higher levels of defence and to others responsible for the design of the aircraft and the management of its use; and that effective pursuit of disciplinary action against such less obvious and organisationally more remote persons was likely to be both extremely difficult and legally nugatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For both reasons, therefore, the Air Commander agreed with the recommendation of the Board of Inquiry in concluding that action under the Defence Force Disciplinary Act was not warranted in the case of the ARDU personnel, was impracticable for others within the defence force, and not legally possible for those outside the defence force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final report by the Ombudsman confirmed that the RAAF investigations were well conducted and that there was no attempt to cover up anything. Although the Ombudsman did not change her view about the existence of justification for disciplinary action, and she named and criticised individuals who had no formal opportunity to defend themselves, the Ombudsman's report has been acknowledged as a comprehensive and objective judgement, and a valuable contribution to the pursuit of air safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to stress the thoroughness of the RAAF investigations, and the timely action by civil and military airworthiness authorities to safeguard further Nomad operations. Furthermore, the wider scope of the Ombudsman's final report in dealing in detail with matters beyond the defence force needs to be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, therefore, there were essentially three phases of inquiry into this unfortunate accident.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the accident produced an extensive technical investigation which led to modification of all Nomads worldwide and alerted airworthiness authorities to the importance of monitoring ground running in setting structural lives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the management and individual performance of all organisations involved from design and manufacture, through acquisition and airworthiness surveillance, and, finally, to maintenance, revealed deficiencies which separately were perhaps not significant at the time but collectively led to a tragic end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the third and most comprehensive phase in this investigation process has been the report by the Ombudsman, following the lengthy and detailed examination of all aspects of the relevant actions of the ADF, GAF/ASTA and the CAA which in all took more than three years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That wide-ranging independent review confirmed the positive action taken by the ADF to prevent a recurrence, and drew attention to CAA and manufacturer actions which will improve the control of aircraft development testing and on-going airworthiness of all aircraft, possibly worldwide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of this exhaustive investigation and inquiry will bring back FltLt Donovan. Undoubtedly his tragic death resulted from a series of seemingly unrelated events, decisions, actions and omissions which culminated in an innocent pilot unknowingly flying an unairworthy aircraft which failed him.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In such circumstances, therefore, the natural desire to sheet home the blame is understandable. However, I suggest to honourable senators that all these events have been thoroughly and comprehensively investigated and reported upon, by both the technical professionals within the ADF and the independent and objective staff of the Ombudsman.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the speech does is go through the whole history of the crash and the first inquiry. I referred the matter to the Ombudsman at the request of the family. It goes on to deal with the Ombudsman's findings. The final point I want to put on the public record, however, is that the overall future of the Nomads in the Australian Defence Force needs some review. They are flying within a very restricted envelope at the moment, using mainly only the most experienced pilots.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions with the Chief of General Staff, which were relayed to the Royal Australian Air Force, I have asked for a review of the safety, economy and utility of the Nomad plane&mdash;both in its use in the army, where it is predominantly used, and also in the air force&mdash;and to report back to me by 30 June 1995. That is not purely related to the incident that Senator Macdonald and I are discussing here today, but it is related to another incident that occurred in the West Indies. So I think it is timely to have the army, in cooperation with the Royal Australian Air Force, look at the future of the Nomad as it is currently being used in the Defence Force, see whether it regards operating in such a restricted envelope as satisfactory from a utility point of view, look at safety issues and also look at the economy of the way we use the plane and see what alternatives are available. So I hope to have that report back to me in June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I think this matter has been well investigated by the RAAF&mdash;at my instigation, by the way, by the Ombudsman. This really smacks of one of those sorts of proposals that, `Oh, gee, we are given a hard problem. Let's set up an inquiry and look into it.' I have not bothered to mount a large, defensive case here because I know how useless it is with the minor parties. They will support anything they think may hurt defence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is a disgrace and will be opposed by us. This motion is here today because of the incompetence of the government in being unable to either frame or keep to a reasonable sitting program. Honourable senators will remember that it was not long ago that the Australian Democrats and other minorities joined with the government to set new sitting times which they said would do away with night sittings. This was to be a great achievement, to the benefit of our health and obviously to the benefit of all those who service this establishment. If the government had kept to the undertakings it gave, there is no reason why that could not have been achieved. In other words, if the government had kept two bills that were introduced in the previous session of parliament and simply debated them, if it had kept its program up to date and if it had had a reasonable working agenda for this session of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we, in fact, found is that for the first half of this session the government simply did not have sufficient work to keep the parliament fully occupied. In effect, we were being asked&mdash;as I am sure my whip will confirm&mdash;to provide the fillers. We were being invited to come in here with opposition business because the government was short of legislation. There would have been no reason for it to be short of legislation if it had done what it had undertaken, put in the bills in the last session of parliament and provided for orderly legislative process in this place. There would have been a full program in the first half of this session, and there would have been no need for us to be sitting late at this stage of the session. It was only halfway through the session before the government had to breach its earlier undertakings and start to disband the sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That happened last week. Last week the government had to get a motion through this place, and it did so. I wanted to object to it on that occasion, but we were distracted by other matters and the debating opportunity was missed. Nevertheless, as Senator Faulkner knows, we were opposed to it on that occasion. Here we are, back here this week, and Senator Faulkner now wants two extended sitting nights this week. That would be totally unnecessary with orderly programming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know what we can do to further press this government to program its legislation in a sensible way. As you are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, on previous occasions we have provided for cut-off dates as an inducement for this government to perform its functions properly. As a result of that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) decided that he would punish the opposition in the House of Representatives and remove from them, by a unilateral act, the normal resources of an opposition, such as the right to move a censure motion, the right to raise matters of public importance and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want to impose that restraint on the House of Representatives again, so all we can really do is call upon the minority parties&mdash;I guess the Australian Democrats in particular, as they are the ones who seem to roll over so easily at the government's request in these matters&mdash;to stand by the requirement that they had agreed to at the start of the session, and that is that there would not be these night sittings and that the government would be required to introduce and have debated its legislation in reasonable order. Until the Democrats are prepared to stand up and stand by their previous requirements, the government will be able to ride roughshod over the place because it will have the numbers. It has the numbers so often with their support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come in here with clean hands because last Thursday we did not pursue the opposition's opportunity to consider our own business. We gave it up to facilitate the government's program. What did we do the previous week? We did the same thing. We have bent over backwards to help the government with its program, and what thanks do we get for that? The government simply comes in here, does its deal with the Australian Democrats and says, `The parliament is going to sit longer hours.' It will sit longer hours again next week. We can see what is happening, because the government has a mass of legislation to get through. It has no chance of getting it through in the time that has been allocated. Estimates committees have not even been brought on yet. The government's program is to consider a full week's worth of legislation together with the estimates. Do the Australian Democrats realise this? Have they read the program?</PARA>

They will not because they work hand in glove with the government. They are almost part of the same machine. They might as well do their business in the caucus. I sometimes wonder why they come into this place at all. Really, the Australian Democrats have given up any attempt to demonstrate what former Senator Chipp established, which was that they would try, as they said, to keep both sides of this chamber honest. They are now simply part of the government's legislative machine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at what happened in relation to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill, an important bill which is to be debated today. The Australian Democrats gave the nod to the government before even seeing the detail. Of course they will support the government's position because they are now part of the government. What have the Australian Democrats done in relation to the forthcoming racial vilification bill? We have not seen that bill, but the Australian Democrats have already told the government that they are fully in support of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they have. The Australian Democrats have told the government they will support it. Without even seeing the legislation, they have told the government that it can have that legislation. What purpose are the Australian Democrats therefore serving within the Australian political system if they are simply going to write a blank cheque to this government? They believe a hard day's work is coming in here and keeping the opposition honest. They place no pressure whatsoever upon the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that the Australian Democrats have so abdicated the role that former Senator Chipp established for them in the Australian Senate. That is a matter of regret, but they will answer for that because the Australian people can now not see any distinction at all between the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party. They see them as just one group of a common mind and a common position. Therefore, it is not surprising that the Australian Democrats are doing so poorly in the polls. The Australian Democrats will not come in here and join with us to keep this government honest, so the test moves to the Western Australian Greens. Will they do it on this occasion, or will they also simply roll over at the request of the government?</PARA>

We have kept up with the government's program. We have given up general business, MPIs and other matters to keep up with the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that earlier in the session there was very little work available for the Senate to proceed with. That was welcome because we had an opportunity to pursue matters in which we had an interest. But the government certainly has not had its business before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it incredibly disappointing that, after all the effort and discussion that we had with the Greens, the Democrats and Senator Harradine about getting reasonable and sensible sitting hours, we have before us today a motion for which not one explanation&mdash;not even an attempt at an explanation&mdash;has been given to the Senate or to any senators as to why we should have to sit late tonight and tomorrow night and why the program cannot proceed in an orderly fashion as was laid out at the beginning of the session. We have not been told, but the government may have told some of its friends. There has not been a suggestion. It is the mere whim of somebody that we will sit late tonight and tomorrow night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps people might have agreed to one night; but two nights? When we think of the hours we are sitting and see how tired some people around here look&mdash;and I am particularly thinking of the minister at the table, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans)&mdash;we realise that this proposal is an absurd and an absolute abuse of honourable senators. The fact is that even now we are not reverting to the sitting hours that we abandoned earlier this year. Then, we sat at 10 o'clock in the morning. To be ready at 10 a.m. and to deal with the committee work that all of us had, it was necessary to be here between 8 and 8.30 a.m. We still have to be here no later than 8 a.m. and we start at 9.30 a.m. So it is not the same as it was; it is worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the old sitting arrangements we had a luncheon adjournment of 1 1/4 hours. A lot of committees met during that time, but the chamber did not meet. Now there is no luncheon adjournment on a Wednesday; we sit through. Clearly, the manager of this place has no regard whatever for the impact of these changes not only on honourable senators but also on the staff and everyone else who has to run the place in and out of the chamber. The absence of a luncheon adjournment is not reasonable. I cannot think of any doctor or nutritionist in the country who would think that was a sensible, worthwhile situation. When I was elected to this place there was a two-hour dinner adjournment. It was then whittled away to 1 1/2 hours. Now it is a one-hour dinner adjournment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government was prepared to say that the Senate would sit until the legislation was finished. It now at least has put in a cut-off time of 10.30 p.m. for both tonight and tomorrow night. We will then have the adjournment debate. So there are some very significant differences between what we used to do and what we are now being required to do by adding these night sitting times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we might have agreed to one extra night had we been given notice of it. But honourable senators are entitled to make arrangements for other things consistent with the sitting pattern that was presented to us at the beginning of the year&mdash;knowing that in the last week or so we may have to give up a night or two. People at that stage keep the time free because they know that will happen. We are four weeks from the end of the session and no reason has been given as to why we all should have our lives disrupted in this fashion. People make commitments to do other things, to go to meetings and to speak at functions. They then have to ring up and say, `Sorry, the government is so disorganised with its sitting pattern that we are now sitting tonight and I cannot keep my commitment to you.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least under the old arrangement, when we sat from 8 p.m. to 10.30 p.m., one could say, `No, I cannot do it; the Senate is sitting.' Unless senators are given leave from this place they will have to pull out of the commitments they have made to attend meetings in their electorates and other places. Since we came to this arrangement, Wednesday nights have almost been regarded as sacred&mdash;as a night when the Senate will rise and give people an opportunity to have an early night, to go and do something else, to catch up with work. That is not the case now&mdash;Wednesday has also been taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of a lot of honourable senators on both sides of the chamber who have legitimate, reasonable commitments for tomorrow night. Perhaps the government could put the motion in two parts&mdash;one part concerning Tuesday night and the other concerning Wednesday night. Perhaps that would be one proposition. But to persist with the Wednesday night as well as Tuesday night and to disrupt so many people's arrangements is outrageous, inconsiderate and the sort of thing that only Senator Evans would do when he is hell-bent on achieving something that he wants, no matter what the impact on other people around him. I suggest to him that the government should not persist with the proposal for tomorrow night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a plea to those who earlier this year negotiated the sensible sitting hours. The Democrats and the Greens were a part of that. I recall them saying that they were opposed to the sort of arrangement that we had imposed on ourselves; and that they wanted sensible sitting hours. The adjournment debate ought to conclude at 8 p.m tomorrow night. At least there would be some reason for reaching such a compromise. But to demand&mdash;having been here early this morning for meetings&mdash;that we sit late tonight and then tomorrow with no luncheon adjournment and a truncated dinner adjournment ought to be abandoned here and now. I hope the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) does exactly that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats and the government did. We all make arrangements in accordance with the change in the sitting hours. We decided that we could finish with the day's business by 7.30 p.m. I was about to say when I was rudely interrupted a moment ago that we have all now noted, as Senator Reid said, that we can go to functions at embassies or whatever around Canberra after the time we rise. The time for these functions has been changed from 6.30 p.m. to 8 p.m. For example, tomorrow night there is a function to welcome the English cricketers to this country. We could have gone to that function; but, unfortunately, now we cannot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are capitulating, rolling over and having their tummy tickled again by the government to change things that they had agreed to. The Democrats should stick to the agreement which says, `We are now going to have a certain time that is going to go on for quite some time'. It is absolutely ridiculous that we should argue like we did earlier in the year and change it all again. Senator Evans has probably gone home to bed because he must be feeling a little peaky and tired. Maybe he might not come back tonight. As a minister, he is most probably entitled to do that; but the rest of us have to sit here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last session we had some ridiculous sitting hours&mdash;we went through until 3 o'clock in the morning and went through on a Saturday night&mdash;all because this government could not organise its affairs properly. The Democrats are rolling over, having their tummies tickled, and capitulating here again to the government to change the hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats always have a little bit of trouble sticking to what they agree to, because sometimes they get a whim to change from one thing to the other. Basically, I cannot understand why they are doing it at this stage. As I said, it is bad people management. It is bad management of the chamber. It is bad for people's health. As far as we are concerned, it is bad for everyone in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why does the government not actually stick to the agreements that it makes in the first instance, instead of coming into this chamber and saying, `We have made a blunder. We have changed the sitting hours and now we are going to change them back again'? I believe that this definitely should be voted out. We should stick to an agreement that we had in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are we going to change the sitting hours at the beginning of the year, before the government calls its early election or whatever it is thinking of doing? Or will we stick to a sitting time for a certain period so that we do not have the problem of constantly changing our sitting times? I again quote what Senator Bourne said. What did she say? She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was alarmingly convincing on the health consequences of sitting long and ridiculous hours and the effects of sleep deprivation on the human being's capacity for making competent decisions, and I found it somewhat shocking. I recommend this submission to all honourable senators before they vote on this question. I think it is a very good and comprehensive submission. Senator Herron is somebody we want to have on our side.</PARA>
<PARA>Why in the hell did Senator Kernot and the Democrats not stick to what they said? Do they want to go back to the sitting hours to which we all agreed earlier?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For decade after decade we have had a situation where the Senate has gone into the ungodly hours of the morning. We have had a routine of business that in large measure has prevented that occurring. The program that we have has been responsibly and sensibly managed by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do seek late sittings tonight and tomorrow night. We do that for good reasons. After five sitting weeks the Senate has passed only 25 packages out of a legislation program totalling nearly 70 packages. With over half of the sittings gone, the Senate has considered less than 40 per cent of the legislation program. Senators would be aware that in the next period of sitting weeks four days of government business time will be effectively lost to estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only because of a 15-hour burst on legislation, which was helped by a late sitting last week, the average time spent on legislation reached just over nine hours a week. Before that, time on legislation was well short of the 10 hours a week the government considers it should expect, including only two hours and 15 minutes spent on legislation in week three of these sittings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time has been spent on a lot of other matters: on the Procedure Committee report; on debates on committee references&mdash;desertification is one, and the ABC is another that come to mind; on disallowance motions; and on frequent and, I might say, very flimsy matters of public importance that have been promoted by the opposition. The legislation program has also been disrupted by the number of references of bills to committees. Of 37 bills introduced in the winter sittings, 12 were referred to committees in the first two sittings weeks of spring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously this type of scrutiny has its place. The government accepts that this type of scrutiny has its place. But we do not deserve any criticism at all for the management of government business in this place. Already we have spent some six hours in the committee stage of the particular bill for which these two negations are proposed. The late nights being proposed do give the Senate an opportunity to conclude its consideration of this bill. It will also give us time to deal with the remainder of our program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Considerable progress has been made in the way this chamber operates. There has always been a situation where urgent bills and budget bills have been identified and special arrangements put in place to deal with them. We do have on our program at the moment a proposal to deal with the racial hatred bill in week nine and, of course, we also have a proposal at this stage to deal with the sexual conduct bill in week eight. What is being proposed by the government here is sensible; it is good management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to see a situation where senators know, at the conclusion of the next four sittings weeks, that they can effectively go home for Christmas; they effectively can make the sorts of arrangements which senators have been talking about. There is some certainty in the process. There is some certainty in the program. That is what we are proposing in this particular suggestion that we negate tonight and on Wednesday night. It means a couple of late night sittings: no longer than&mdash;in fact, shorter than&mdash;the sitting hours we have had historically in this chamber now for a long period of time. That is the situation, and I suggest to senators that this is responsible. This is a sensible way of proceeding. This gives senators an opportunity to get some certainty into our program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are senators, either tonight or Wednesday night, as Senator Reid said in her contribution, who have particular problems, the government certainly will be very reasonable with any pairing arrangements that the opposition cares to propose to the government. This is the only way in which effectively we can get through the balance of our business program. Senators have some certainty and can be confident that they will get home for Christmas.

<PARA>I point out to this chamber a very serious matter that has developed with regard to the presentation of documents to the Senate. Today, 11 documents have been presented to this chamber in the one day from the Department of Communications and the Arts. If we look at the actual dates that are contained within the documents when they were finally presented, we see that they range from 16 September to 18 October. Having been presented over that range of almost a month, miraculously they have all arrived in this chamber on exactly the same day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators are aware, we have six speakers who have five minutes each in which to speak. If I wanted to speak in the area of communications on these 11 documents, I would not get through all 11. I would not have the opportunity to speak on any other matters and not one other senator would be able to speak on any other matter. This is an abuse of the processes of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole idea of having these documents come into the Senate is that senators can give these matters proper scrutiny. Yet the Department of Communications and the Arts has abused this process by, on one day, bringing in the reports of the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation, the matter before us at the moment; of the Australian Broadcasting Commission; of the Australian Broadcasting Authority; of the National Museum of Australia; of the Australia Council; of the Australian Film Commission; of the Australian Film Finance Corporation Ltd; of the National Library of Australia; of the National Film and Sound Archive; of Film Australia; and the annual report on public lending rights&mdash;11 documents in all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A similar thing happened two years ago with the Department of Employment, Education and Training. It was trying the same trick. At that time we wrote to the department and asked it to desist from that practice and to spread the documents through a proper time span so that members of the Senate would have time to properly scrutinise these documents. Obviously, the Department of Communications and the Arts has decided the same trick would avoid scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I request the President of the Senate to write to the minister, Mr Lee, to ask the department to desist from this practice and, if they receive the 11 documents over a period of one month, as the inside cover indicates, that they be presented over a period of one month and not on one day. We will be taking this matter further with a notice of motion tomorrow because we think it is a very serious abuse of the parliamentary system. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, before the suspension of the sitting, I was speaking about the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation annual report and following remarks made by Senator Tierney about the unsatisfactory manner in which these reports have been lumped together for treatment today. There are in fact 44 annual reports on today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> to be dealt with in half an hour with speeches of five minutes each. Obviously only six reports can be dealt with out of the 44.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of these reports are quite important. I suppose that we should be grateful at least that these reports have come down before next week because next week is taken up by Senate estimates committee hearings. We are supposed to have had access to these reports to give us detailed knowledge of their content, but this will not occur before we are involved in Senate estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested that the Special Broadcasting Service Corporation annual report was delivered to the Minister on 17 October and in fact received by him on 18 October. I imagine it would have been a bit much to have expected the report to have come into this chamber in one day because we sat on 19 and 20 October. Such a procedure might have been asking for miracles. Nonetheless we were here yesterday, although we now face the ludicrous situation that reports that come in on a Monday are not dealt with, or apparently not dealt with, because we had a whole swag of reports that were submitted during the break and subjected to a different system of handling. Yesterday, as I recall, there was no attachment whatever of documents to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for order of business for yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not simply a matter of our not being given time to deal with these reports properly but, as Senator Tierney pointed out, many associated annual reports from the Department of Communications and the Arts such as those from the Australian National Maritime Museum, the National Library of Australia, the Australia Council and so on, have all come in in one lump today; even though the report of the Australia Council, according to a document that I have in my hands, was submitted to the minister on 5 October, but also was only received by the minister on 19 October. What was the report doing for those 14 days until, magically, it appeared to have been received by the minister?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the present system is not working properly. We experienced this problem towards the end of last year. I have now been handed a copy of yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order of Business</EMPHASIS> and I see that not one report is attached to it. I do not know whether it has been agreed that we are not to deal with these reports under the new funny arrangements that we seem to have, which appear to limit our dealing to reports to a period of only four days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these documents will be deferred to Thursday when we will have to sit for extra time and they will be dealt with under general business. Once again this will give honourable senators very little opportunity to deal with reports. For example, the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation is item No 22 on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order of Business</EMPHASIS> for today. There are multi millions of dollars involved in that corporation. We have also experienced the resignation of the corporation's chief executive, and yet we are supposed to deal adequately with item No 22 in a list of 44 such items. If that is regarded as an adequate way of handling such matters, I feel the situation is quite ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with Senator Tierney in his protests. I would point out that in terms of the Special Broadcasting Service, the item with which we are now dealing, we know that there will have to be changes in the leadership of that organisation following changes at the ABC. Surely this parliament should be entitled to discuss these matters. There are many reports on this list that I would like to have the opportunity of dealing with. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>These amendments insert a new subsection at the end of proposed section 191D and make a consequential amendment to proposed section 191G(3). While the objective of the legislation is to acquire land for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, no clause ensures that the interest is actually granted. The bill also implies that the ILC may acquire land for other purposes. The Greens (WA) are concerned that any organisation that is set up to acquire land for Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders should actually deliver that land to our indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that the ILC should primarily remain a land acquisition agency and not become a major land-holder itself. Therefore, these two amendments build into the proposed legislation an imperative for the ILC to grant land to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons or corporations, or trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts `as soon as practicable' after that acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that three conditions may underlie the purchase of land by the ILC. One is office accommodation, which is perfectly appropriate; the second is investment; and the third is a grant. It is in relation to that third condition that we want a clause put in to say that it will be made as soon as practicable after it is acquired rather than held. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support these amendments. We do not see them as providing any real additional benefit, while at the same time they reduce the flexibility that would otherwise be available to the ILC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the intention of the bill, as spelt out in 191D(3)(b), that land be granted as soon as practicable after acquisition. However, in its present form, the bill provides additional flexibility in situations where, for example, the ILC purchases an area of land only part of which is required for granting to indigenous people and the remainder is to be disposed of at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILC also needs this flexibility in situations where, for example, there is a dispute within the community about who is entitled to holdings in the land in question. The ILC needs to be able to delay transfer until such disputes are resolved. Senator O'Chee has already argued in the Senate that this situation would be prevalent throughout Australia. It may be that that is a situation requiring action as soon as practicable; nonetheless, we think that the extra flexibility in the bill as presently drafted is preferable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As drafted, the Greens' amendments would require the ILC to always make a grant, even in circumstances where the land is not acquired for that purpose&mdash;for example, where the land is acquired by gift or bequest. I am advised that it also creates a potential problem of inconsistency with section 191J, which allows disposal of land to non-indigenous persons or bodies in circumstances where the land is no longer required for granting to indigenous interests. As we see it, the amendments would remove the capacity of the ILC to exercise its independent judgment on the appropriate time for granting interests in land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advised that this question of practicality is justiciable. Accordingly, this drafting opens up further opportunities for challenges to be made which would, at the very least, delay matters and, at the worst, damage the credibility of the organisation. The consequential amendments, which are part of the Greens' proposal, provide a similar stricture on ILC subsidiaries, and the same points apply to those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there a number of reasons, all essentially technical in character. There is no fundamental point of principle involved in this particular exchange. But, as I have said, we think that the extra flexibility afforded by the bill in the way it is drafted at the moment, which is important for practical and effective operation, would be denied with the Greens' amendment. For that reason, we do not support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA>Coalition amendment No. 7 again goes to the principles of the policies of land acquisition. From the very outset of its consideration of the land fund bill, the coalition wanted to ensure that the direction of the bill and the policy of land acquisition addressed the very serious needs of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, by passing an amendment on the last day of the last sitting fortnight, adding a preamble which ensured that the land fund would be directed towards affecting those who are most severely dispossessed, the Senate has agreed to give this land fund a clear direction. In similar terms, from the very outset, the coalition has been set on ensuring that when the ILC goes about seeking to purchase land for and on behalf of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians it bears in mind some of the very serious disadvantage suffered by many of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to remind the Senate that Aboriginal Australians suffer significant disadvantage in health, housing and education, economically and, in some cases, socially and culturally. The coalition believes that the ILC should bear in mind those significant disadvantages when considering its purchase of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has heard the government&mdash;including the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner)&mdash;and the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, say that this is some sort of perversion of the land fund and that it seeks to send the land fund in a direction in which it was not intended to go. Indeed, they have gone on to say, `We know there are problems with health, housing and education, but don't worry about that, we'll fix it later with another package of legislation and through other programs.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition does not believe that the principles of the land fund and the ILC are affected by ensuring that, in seeking to purchase land for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, members of the board of the ILC and its operatives have in mind the very important areas of health, housing and education and economic, social and cultural needs when making those sorts of decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know from personal experience that there have been  widespread land acquisitions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people that have done nothing whatsoever to assist them in these fundamental areas of disadvantage. This amendment gives some direction. It creates a principle that needs to be abided by, particularly when a decision is being made between one piece of land and another. This is a direction that we believe all Australian citizens would share when contemplating the proposal to commit an extra $21 million a year to set up this $1.4 billion fund. We should ensure that the ILC takes into account these fundamental areas of disadvantage and need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough for the government to say, `We will fix these problems with another package of bills. We will address this with our social justice package.' Who knows when that is going to turn up? It is simply not good enough for the government to use this as an excuse for opposing what is a very principled amendment. This amendment seeks to implant in the bill a principle that I think just about every Australian would share; that is, when we address land acquisition for Aboriginal people, we bear in mind the fundamental objective of overcoming these disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that some principles about redressing Aboriginal disadvantages would be put into the bill but other principles&mdash;such as health and fundamental standards of living&mdash;would be ignored could not be taken seriously. When the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration dealt with this bill in the Friday committee, we heard&mdash;particularly from Senator Kernot&mdash;that these should be fundamental human rights. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Citizenship rights. Thank you for correcting me, Senator Kernot. She said that they should be the rights of all citizens, and indeed they should be. We now live in a nation where, for 30 or 40 years, well-intentioned governments have been pumping billions upon billions of dollars into Aboriginal programs, yet we still have as a national disgrace thousands of Aboriginals living in circumstances where their fundamental health, education and housing needs are not met. Many of them live in circumstances where their communities have no potential for economic viability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite ludicrous to say, `These are fundamental rights, so you should not enshrine them in a program that is specifically designed to overcome Aboriginal disadvantage and dispossession.' That is wrong. We all admit that there is a fundamental disadvantage suffered by many of these Aboriginal people. Sure, they are citizenship rights, but the Aboriginals whom we are thinking about and seeking to introduce special measures for to overcome these disadvantages do not enjoy these citizenship rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government introduces these special programs, it should give very special consideration to overcoming this form of disadvantage. It is simply not acceptable to the coalition for the government to say, `It is okay. We will address these in a social justice package or through other programs.' They have not been addressed. We have had a Labor government for 11 years, with a series of very well-intentioned ministers for Aboriginal affairs over the years. Most of them came into the job with starry eyes and good intentions, and most of them left bitter and dejected because they were not able to achieve things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We suggest that when these sorts of measures are brought in to overcome disadvantage&mdash;particularly in relation to access to land&mdash;there should be a coordinated strategy that looks at all of the areas of disadvantage. That is why these sorts of objectives should be put into the policy of land acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the Democrats have said that we are seeking to redirect the fund and make it unworkable. They would have honourable senators believe that we require land acquisition officers to have a check list when they go around to look at the land so they could tick health, education, economic viability and housing. That is a straw man. It is a furphy. It is an argument that simply does not hold water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators need only read the words of the amendment to understand that these are objectives. Of course, land acquisition officers do not have to go around and tick a check list before they buy land. They are things that must be borne in mind when pursuing land acquisition activities. That is the effect of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would seek to build this up as some sort of fundamental undermining of the principles of the land acquisition bill. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) knows in his own heart that that is absolute rubbish. Mr Keating and Mr Tickner set out on a course to basically say no to all of the opposition amendments. They picked on one or two that they found objectionable. This was the first one that they picked out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to tell the government that this does not go down very well in the community. People in the community&mdash;whether at a barbecue, a bar or wherever we talk to people outside Canberra&mdash;know that Aboriginals suffer these disadvantages. They know that we have been spending billions of dollars over the years and not making a significant impact on many of these problems. They know that there should be a coordinated strategy, a bipartisan effort, towards ensuring that we overcome these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely unreal to suggest that, by putting these objectives in the strategies that should be applied to land acquisition, it will not assist quite specifically to overcome some of these disadvantages. Quite clearly, the government is seeking to build up some sort of artificial objection to this amendment, because no sensible human being could oppose this amendment on any logical ground. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators need only read the words of the amendment to know that the intention is absolutely honourable. It is an honourable intention not just on the part of this Senate. It should be the honourable intention of all Australians to seek to assist those who suffer this disadvantage. We should not seek to do so through a promised social justice package that may appear in here in some future period or by ATSIC saying that it will address it through its existing programs. Those programs are not working. A coordinated strategy is needed, and this amendment seeks to achieve that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the Senate to overcome the cheap, political partisanship that the government has displayed in the early weeks of this debate. We should say, `This is fair dinkum. We can go forward together and ensure that the land fund upholds these very important principles.'</PARA>

I would not want him to leave anyone with the impression that there is a political objection only to this particular opposition amendment, that this is simply a matter of empty posturing without substance and that there are no problems with the way in which the opposition amendment is cast, because there are such problems. The coalition amendment, as will be seen, proposes to make the ILC have regard at all times to Aboriginals' needs. It would do this by having regard to the following:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . addressing their health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural needs, as a result of the acquisition of land. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment, however, does not specify how the needs might be assessed, nor how to quantify the difference any land acquisition would make. That leaves a two-horned dilemma to confront. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the one hand, the needs must be assessed and the benefits quantified; in which case, this undermines the whole philosophy behind the bill, which is one of addressing the dispossession through access to land, the focus being on land. I will come back to this point later. Alternatively, the words of this amendment do not require any assessment of needs and benefits; in which case, one is left with the only possible conclusion that this is essentially meaningless window-dressing. Either it means something or it means nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that, if it means something, it means it is not only something at odds with the basic philosophy of this legislation&mdash;as I would suggest&mdash;but it is something that once again is potentially damaging to the practical effectiveness and workability of the legislation. Then we have to ask, `If there is some test that is capable of justiciable action in the courts, how do you start addressing the question as to whether particular purchases would meet the various other objectives that are spelt out? What tests would be applied? Who would sit in judgment?' Here we go again opening up the ILC's decisions to legal challenge and argument. At the very least, it is time consuming and disruptive, even if at the end of the day there proved to be no substance in the challenge being mounted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This again is the problem with this sort of clause. It may be well intentioned. I am not going to make assumptions about the motive for all aspects of the opposition's amendments. I have indicated a willingness throughout this debate to consider these amendments as they come individually on their merits, and to give rational arguments&mdash;not just political fusillades&mdash;in response to each amendment and to explain why it is we have difficulty with them. I am doing that again now. I am not making any assumptions for the sake of this debate now, whatever might have been the case in the past, that there is something sort of intentionally wrong-headed or disruptive about this. I am just saying that that is its effect. It is either going to have that effect if we give it content, if we give it applicability, if we try to give it meaning, or else it is going to have no effect at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might say that, even if it does not have any effect at all, nonetheless it is still a virtuous proposition because it draws attention to what we all acknowledge to be continuing needs of Aboriginal people in the areas of health, housing, education and so on. This is where I think it is important to focus again on the basic objects of this bill and what this bill is seeking to distinctively add to the store of legislative and other weapons we have available to us in addressing the problems of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill already provides that the purposes of the ILC are to assist indigenous people to acquire and manage land, to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits. There is some overlap to the extent there is an emphasis here on economic, social and environmental benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the amendment demonstrates that the coalition really still has not come to grips with the fundamental point of establishing a land fund and has still not really, even perhaps with good intentions, understood the centrality of land as land&mdash;land by itself; land as distinct from other programs, other objectives, other ends; land as a central aspect of all aspects of indigenous people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment demonstrates what, I have to say, is essentially a welfarist approach to indigenous affairs. There is scope for a welfare policy, scope for huge dollops of money going into a welfare based policy. But there has to be something more to that. What this legislation is trying to do is add that something more. What this bill is trying to do is give indigenous people the opportunity essentially for self-determination and economic independence through land and enterprise ownership. Both a spiritual need and an economic need are here being satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite look at what indigenous people say, they will find, every time they ask them, that they will say that the first and most important way&mdash;not the only important way, but the first and most important way&mdash;to improve the viability of indigenous communities is to have access to land. From that access to land, there is a flow-on of benefits to all aspects of community life. Tracker Tilmouth, in his evidence to the committee on 21 September, put this graphically in one aspect of his evidence. As reported at page 94 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I simply urge that this committee pass the legislation as quickly as possible so that we can get on with the job of meeting the land needs of Aboriginal people who live in appalling conditions on small matchbox type excisions on pastoral properties and get on with the job of providing them with decent housing, decent health and decent employment, which are their rights under the current laws of this country. We need the land. You can have all the theories about health and housing stuck up there on the board, but they will not mean diddly-squat unless you have the land to put the bloody things on. The land not only provides that but also provides alternative economic opportunities which are not available to Aboriginal communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has come graphically, effectively, from the mouth of someone who knows what this debate is about, knows what this argument is about and knows what the added value is that this legislation is offering to all the other ways of addressing Aboriginal needs that are already on the board. This is why this is such a substantial initiative on the part of the government&mdash;because it recognises for the first time in a substantial way that dispossession is really the central issue that the government needs to address in indigenous affairs and certainly is an issue that needs to be addressed in a sharply focused way to the extent that that has not been the case before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we see this proposal as really in a sense doing&mdash;and I am not putting this in any condemnatory way but as a practical reading of the implications of it&mdash;is effectively subverting the intention of the land fund by requiring the land fund essentially to meet the objectives of other programs. If we implement it and, again, if we give weight and substance to it and do not treat it as just a bit of cosmetic add-on, we will have a situation where the corporation will effectively become a second ATSIC with a whole range of functions, responsibilities and things it has to take into account rather than being able to focus simply on this question of land. That kind of duplication seems to us to be unnecessary, counterproductive and creative, as I have said, of potential for confusion. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is only a transitional mechanism, as Senator Campbell knows perfectly well. The ATSIC capacity to spend money on land will in fact be phased out over the next three years, and we will not have any duplication. Those opposite can argue about that to their hearts' content when we get to that particular clause. That is not what is on the table before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members have commented that the government is providing at the moment only an additional $24 million annually for land. But if this money were used to meet the objectives of other programs as well&mdash;as is really implicit in this amendment, if not explicit&mdash;effectively we would be reducing the capacity to use this money, limited as it is, for this sole purpose of land for which this legislation is intended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just finish what I am saying. The point here is that there are other programs. We can argue about their adequacy and we can argue about their impact but, through ATSIC itself, just under a billion dollars is being spent, essentially on the whole range of other program areas that are identified in this legislation, and another half a billion dollars is being spent through DEET and other agencies separate from ATSIC, again for these purposes. It is only a relatively small amount of money that we are talking about here, as no doubt Senator Chamarette will tell us at nauseous length in due course, but it is money that is devoted for a specific purpose in the ways that I have described. If those opposite seek to dilute it in this particular fashion, they will not serve the purposes of this legislation and they will not meet the real needs of Aboriginal people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with a great deal of interest to what Senator Gareth Evans had to say. I assume that it was not deliberate, but it was quite apparent to me that he had not bothered to focus on the words of the amendment.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What he read out was something to the effect that our amendment requires the ILC to have regard to the need to address health, housing, et cetera. It does not say that at all. It simply does not say that. I invite Senator Evans to confirm that either he has a truncated and misleading brief note in front of him or he deliberately went out of his way to telescope the wording of our amendment to the point where it gives a very unreal and unhelpful assessment. Our amendment states&mdash;again, the words in brackets are important&mdash;that the requirement is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . (except where the circumstances make the pursuit of such a policy impracticable or inadvisable) to have regard, at all times, to the need to improve the viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Those opposite should ask themselves the question: what if we transferred land and it did not improve the viability of those communities? What have we achieved? In other words, if those communities remain unviable, are going backwards or are simply wallowing in squalor and lack all of the basic human rights that we all regard as essential, what has been achieved by transferring the land? `Not by bread alone' is probably what it amounts to. People simply cannot say, `I've got a spiritual attachment to the land, and that will get me through this life.' Once they have the land, they have to do something with it and something with their lives. The land is necessary, but it is not sufficient to achieve any meaningful improvement in the quality of life of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the object of the exercise? If we look at the bill itself, it is very significant that the purpose of the fund is not simply to assist Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to acquire land. What Senator Evans has just said would infer that that is what this is all about: to give people land because they have such a strong spiritual attachment to it&mdash;we should not worry about anything beyond that; we simply give them the land and, if we want to deal with any of the other material deficiencies, we do that by specific projects and programs. But that is not what his own bill says. It says that the purpose is to assist in the acquisition and management of land so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits. In other words, it is what flows from acquiring the land that is vitally important. That is what we are trying to achieve: a measurable benefit in their quality of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person whom Senator Evans quoted said that land provides alternative economic opportunities. He was not saying, `Land per se is all we want.' He did not want to just sit under a tree and say, `Thank you very much. You have delivered. You have recognised the spiritual significance of the land, so we have got it. So how do we fill in the next 40 years?' He was looking ahead and saying, `We need it because it provides an economic base; it gives us the opportunity to re-establish our lives, to gain rising morale and self-respect.' In that way they can achieve all the things that we take for granted, such as health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural benefits. In a sense, those are only examples. They are a subset of the paramount requirement, which is the need to improve the viability of those communities. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Evans spent only six months at the bar, but I also know that in that time, even when he had briefs other than those from the union organisations, he actually looked at how to interpret words. He knows that `including' is simply in many senses an example. The test to be applied is whether it improves the viability of the communities. It might improve viability by addressing health, housing and other needs. It might improve the viability by other means. This is simply one aspect of the crucial test, which is the need to improve the viability of those communities. If Senator Evans denies that that is relevant to the whole object of the exercise, then he is denying the purpose of his land corporation, which is to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans cannot have it both ways. He cannot say to us, `Look, don't worry about anything else but the land. This is just about land, full stop. We are not interested in what happens after that. Come back with another package,' when his own bill does not say that. The purpose of the bill is to go beyond merely the transfer of land&mdash;the empty transfer in many respects&mdash;in order to try and achieve a measurable improvement. I simply ask the minister to indicate whether that was an oversight on his part in telescoping the wording of our amendment, or whether in fact he simply misread the whole amendment to the point where he did not think the need to improve viability was the crucial test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the crucial test, and I am sure that that is what every Aboriginal community will tell him that they want. They want the land so as to improve their viability. They can do that in a variety of ways. They know better than we do, I suspect, what a significant improvement in health, housing, educational and other needs will mean. And it will flow from their acquisition of the land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I respond to some of the more patronising dimensions of that particular contribution from Senator Alston. It is a distinction without a difference that Senator Alston is trying to draw between saying, as I did in capsule summary form, that it requires the ILC to address health, housing and educational needs. What Senator Alston is saying is that it only requires them to have regard to what is necessary to improve the viability of those communities. It is simply getting to the same result by a slightly more circuitous route.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are being asked to look at not just what is the viability, yea or nay, of a particular community; we are being asked to look at what is necessary to improve the viability. How else would one examine the viability of a particular community except by looking at its economic needs as well as some of these other social needs that are here spelt out? One could not sensibly address the question of viability&mdash;and in particular the question of what might be necessary to improve viability from whatever level had already been achieved&mdash;without having regard to those things. It comes back to the same basic point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I squeezed them together was that, in reading this originally, it had seemed to me to be not something that made any difference to the basic analysis. At the end of the day all of this is prefaced by a `must'&mdash;the ILC `must' have regard to these various things. What it `must' have regard to, if this amendment is to succeed, is the kind of health, housing, educational and economic needs that are associated with the particular piece of land that it is granting. It is for that reason, as I said before, that we have a situation where either that means something or it means nothing. If it means nothing, it is cosmetic. If it means something, it is potentially quite disruptive in terms of the other objects of the legislation. That is the legal point. Let us get that out of the way; that is boring. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get beyond all the legal niceties, because that is essentially a diversion from the main point. What Senator Alston is really rather contemptuously saying is: `Look, what is all this stuff about spiritual attachment? Man, even Aboriginal man, cannot live by spiritual attachment alone. What we are talking about is land and the kind of economic base that land potentially involves. It is only through the economic character and the liveability of the land in question and its viability in terms of this legislation that this particular grant of land is going to mean anything at all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how much Senator Alston knows about Aboriginal people, but I do not think he knows very much. Let me tell the committee a little story about an Aboriginal person who used to live with my family. He came down from the Northern Territory and he stayed with us while he was doing a law degree at Melbourne University. I have never talked about this sort of stuff because I have never needed to in the past. I need to talk about it now because I want to say something about that particular guy and what he felt about the absence of access to some land that he could call his own or that he could somehow relate to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was living with us, and a year or two later when he brought his wife and kids down, he had this incredible sense of being crowded when living in Melbourne, or in Victoria. He said, `Look, it is no good me driving up into the country', as I suggested he do. He said, `There are fences everywhere. All this land belongs to someone else. There is nothing I can go on. If I go way, way out into western Victoria, yes, maybe I can find a bit of national park or something and get away for a while.' He said, `I feel just so crowded. What I need to do is get away for a day or two or three or a week every now and again just to have that sense of space, to have that sense of relationship with some land that I can relate to. It is no good to just drive up the road and park and have a billy tea by someone's farm fence. That is not the way it works.'

There is something that is important about this which is separate and distinct and over and above the purely mechanistic, economic, man-oriented approach that Senator Alston has to this question. That is why this is important. That is why this particular piece of legislation is adding some value to all the rest of the things that we do that are helpful in so many ways, we hope, to Aboriginal people.

I do not think the argument is about whether this government or any other government will address Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander disadvantages. This debate is about two principles; it is about the fundamental right to land with no strings attached and the fundamental citizenship rights of indigenous Australians as Australians with respect to health, education, housing and the other things that are listed in the amendment. While I agree that the coalition's linkage of these two principles is not ill-intentioned, it is nevertheless still odious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote from a paper from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies, `Land and indigenous health', by Barbara Flick and Brendan Nelson. Under the heading `Rights as entitlements', they make a very telling point. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the High Court found that the Meriam people had a right as against the whole world to possession, occupation, use and enjoyment of the lands of the Murray Islands, the judges did not qualify this by saying `as long as they could show that recognising this will improve their health'.</PARA>
<PARA>One could add `or will improve their housing, their education or their economic, social and cultural needs.' The fundamental point in that judgment, and in other learned writings such as the deaths in custody reports, is that land rights are a collective right inherent to indigenous peoples. We are seeking to impose on them, in our own non-indigenous way, a set of utilitarian criteria. We are saying, `Yes, land rights are a birthright but only under these circumstances.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a land fund. It is not a health fund, a housing fund or an education fund. Recognising it as a land fund is recognising that dispossession is at the root of the continuing problems indigenous people face, problems that arise from economic and social disempowerment. The fundamental recognition of indigenous interests in land should not be dependent upon, or in any way turn on, any test of improvements in living conditions or, with respect to one of the amendments we have already passed, degrees of dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the point of the government's framework in this bill. To clutter up the bill with a prescription that the corporation must have regard at all times to improving viability is unnecessary. I ask the opposition: do you have a set of priorities here? We have just changed words to `give priority to'. In the opposition's cumulative list here, what takes priority&mdash;acquisition of land for cultural benefit or acquisition of land that might be of economic value?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What measurements does the opposition use for improved viability? The opposition says things such as, `If you give land to someone and there is no improved viability, what have you achieved?' I would suggest that it is possible to achieve empowerment, which is a very important principle and something that goes again to the heart, to the root of dispossession and all that flows from that. So I make the point to the opposition that it is possible to demonstrate viability not only in those tangible, commercial terms. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important, but it is not the argument I am having. During that debate, Senator Evans said that these criteria flowed inherently from the ownership of the land. I think he was drawing a long bow but, when I questioned him at the time, he said that the coalition's objectives were thoroughly worth while. But when Senator Evans was further questioned, he conceded that:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . when the corporation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the ILC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is faced with competing claims, probably a number of considerations, including perhaps some of the ones that you have identified, will necessarily come into the equation of decision making.</PARA>
<PARA>That clearly is what is envisaged. We do not in any way seek to detract from the arguments that Senator Evans very emotionally and eloquently made about Aboriginal attachment to land. I do not think it is fair of Senator Evans&mdash;and I do not think he sought to&mdash;to say that he has a greater understanding of that sense of attachment than does anyone on this side. Many of us, because of the age difference, have probably not had as much experience in these things as he has had, but we have had experience and relationships with Aboriginal people and we do understand the relationship between Aboriginals and land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have had the experience of understanding some of the disadvantages that Aboriginal people suffer. We know that land can help to redress that lack of attachment to land, lack of a place, lack of a sense of belonging and the spiritual need to have contact with land that is special to Aboriginal people. We also know that we, as a nation which seeks to overcome the significant disadvantages through various special measures, need to address these disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to some length to ensure that there was no way that the wording of this motion could be read as a check list. That is why the words were `have regard to the need to improve viability'. I say to Senator Harradine that the word `viability' is exactly that. It is not as though you put the high bar up and, if you jump over the viability test, you get the land and, if you do not, you do not. As Senator Kernot quite properly says, it is not a thing that can always be judged with foresight. A lot of people go into all sorts of ventures expecting them to be viable and find out that they are not viable. When the ILC seeks to make purchases and acquisitions, it needs to make an assessment of these things and the crucial test is the viability of the community, including addressing these other objectives that have been canvassed ad nauseam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Evans and the government that of course the land is the primary objective of the fund. That is the first thing. People like Tracker Tilmouth have said, `Look, we've just got to get the land and the other things will flow from the land.' That is quite right and the opposition agrees with that sentiment. We are also saying that the government's bill does not stop at land. It envisages in pages and pages of this legislation land management functions. The land management functions are, of course, crucial to ensuring viability of land. If the government said, `Look, we just want to give Aboriginals land because of spiritual attachment and the need to redress dispossession,' it would not worry about land management at all. It would not go into all of the details of setting out to improve land management and setting up a regime to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians in improving land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So those things are crucial. There is absolute common ground between I think all senators in that regard. What we are saying is that it is important to go further than that and that the ILC should be given a sense of direction. Most Australians would agree that there are a bunch of these fundamental matters and that they should be citizenship rights. </PARA>

All of the measures are considered as measures to overcome the disadvantage that so many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders suffer because they do not enjoy the rights that Senator Kernot and I enjoy, and they do not enjoy some of the rights that Aboriginals in urban Australia enjoy. A lot of them just do not have these citizenship rights. They are citizens of our great nation, but it is not that great because they do not enjoy the rights that we enjoy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think any Australian should have to live in a nation where we have thousands of people not enjoying those sorts of rights. I think all of us are trying to address that. This is our way of saying that, if we want to pursue a land acquisition policy to overcome the dispossession and to overcome this disadvantage, the ILC needs to ensure that it has regard to improvements in the viability of these communities and has special regard to these fundamental disadvantages. That is the opposition's view on this matter. I hope that gives Senator Harradine the clear intention of the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Gareth Evans has sought to narrowly define the effect of the amendment, that certainly is not the way that I would read it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address three things. The first is to emphasise that the opposition is presenting a very different amendment from either the one it presented in the House of Representatives, which has been noted, or the kind of interpretations that were made, possibly by members of the opposition but certainly by the government, of the intentions of any amendment that was presented in the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was an error of judgment on Senator Gareth Evans's part to imply that there was anything about this amendment that would divert the funds from land to any other programs of a housing, educational or health kind. It is quite clear if we read the amendment that it relates specifically to land. That is the first point I want to make: it is about the acquisition and management of land and guidelines and the way in which the ILC goes about these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are necessary partly because the original clause simply refers to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations, and this needs to add wider possibilities or flexibilities. The section that refers to having regard at all times to the need to improve the viability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is actually addressed to the way in which the ILC pursues its purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads me to the second point, which is, I believe, the red herring introduced by the difference between the `or' and the `and'. It does not worry me one bit that this is a list; it does not worry me one bit if it is cumulative because it is essentially addressing the way in which something is being carried out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is being carried out? We need to refer not to the performance of the function, which is the amendment we are talking about here, but to the purpose of the Indigenous Land Corporation. As Senator Gareth Evans has pointed out to us, the purpose of it is to acquire land, to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons to acquire land and to manage indigenously held land so as to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing is taken away by the `or' and nothing is made conditional or cumulative in terms of strings being attached. The purpose remains identical to the one that has been specified by the government in the legislation. It clearly has an `or'. That is why the fact that there is a list here that has `and' in it is of no relevance in terms of tying up anything. All it does is expand the degree of factors that the ILC can take into consideration which might be cumulative and which assist it in the very difficult task it is doing. As Senator Gareth Evans said, this is the task of allocating an extremely scarce resource&mdash;some money&mdash;to cater for the wide demand of many people throughout Australia who have been dispossessed of their lands. So I think it is appropriate to consider whatever factors need to be taken into account. In my view, this is an exhaustive list, but if there were another category, I would be happy to put it in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle that is being made here is that a range of measures will improve the empowerment of Aboriginal people by gaining their land. It underwrites the principle that land and giving Aboriginal people back their land is integral to their wholeness and wellbeing as Aboriginal people and communities. So I do not see anything wrong with including it there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My third point, which is the reason why the Greens will be supporting this amendment, is that it is very similar to our amendment No. 4. Without this amendment and our amendment No. 4 there is an overwhelming impression that this bill is only about dollars and economic viability. If this amendment and our amendment No. 4 are accepted, there will be only three mentions of social and cultural values in this entire bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one reference that is currently in there is in the clause I read out, namely, the purpose clause 191B. Fortunately, it does mention economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits, and appropriately so. It would be a great shame if it were felt that an economic bill was being produced or that some kind of economic hoop had to be gone through in order for the land to be acquired. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the amendment, it deals with health, housing, educational, economic, social and cultural needs. There is nothing greatly dissimilar to what the government has in clause 191B. But the government puts those things there as window dressing; they are there merely for the purpose of the establishment of the ILC. What we are proposing by this amendment is to give the objective reader a better understanding of what that Indigenous Land Corporation has to do and what it has to have regard to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at how it might go about performing its functions. I would suggest it would do it in the following manner. It would firstly have a look at the community, from Redfern to the Pilbara. Remember, this piece of legislation has to cater not just for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders living in remote areas but also for those dispossessed Aboriginals living in urban Australia. I think that at times that has tended to be forgotten during the course of this debate. Legislation dealing with an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community should address these aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Redfern, for instance, there might be more accent placed on health, housing, education and the viability of that community within the suburb of Redfern. On the other hand, in the Pilbara we might be dealing with a community of fringe dwellers or Aboriginal people who are perhaps closer in the traditional sense to their heritage than the urban Aboriginals I have just mentioned. There, you</PARA>
<PARA>might place more accent on the cultural or social aspects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I would suggest to Senator Evans in the strongest possible terms that this is not about good old Anglo-Saxon commercialism. In the criteria that we are addressing we are talking about health, social and cultural needs. They are all pertinent to the viability of a community. I think Senator Harradine has it right. When we look at the viability of a community being able to exist on its own as that entity, we look at it in its environment. We look at those needs and see how they can be addressed in helping it maintain its viability, that is, so that it can remain in the Pilbara or the Kimberley region of Western Australia or Redfern or on the outskirts of Adelaide&mdash;wherever. But the fact is that we look at the community in that context. That is how this legislation is to be interpreted. It is not a question of saying, `Well, I am afraid that this grant of land will do well on health, housing, education, but it misses out on one of the others, so therefore we cannot do it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are always going to have a varying degree of accent, and that is left to the discretion of the Indigenous Land Corporation. It makes abundant sense. It is self-evident. We are not tying up the hands of the Indigenous Land Corporation by suggesting that we would necessarily place one over another in a pecking order. But these are matters which have to be addressed so that none of them is overlooked in the performance of this corporation's functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without this amendment, the Indigenous Land Corporation is a rudderless ship. It does not have anything to direct itself to. The only thing it could possibly direct itself to is the purpose of its existence contained in clause 191B, which says that it has to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefit. The difference is that we have particularised the issue in a way that I believe will be clearer to the objective reader, and to the ILC when it comes to perform those functions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not class all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the same way. We do not put them all in the same basket. We do not expect those in more remote regions to have the terrace style housing that we might find in inner city Sydney. It is quite ludicrous to think that we would look at communities in that manner. We take these communities in the context in which we find them. We address the viability of the community and keeping that community as a whole which can continue to sustain itself and be autonomous and free. We address these issues. We do not necessarily have to say that, because one might have scant weight compared with others, the grant fails. That is not what this amendment says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the thrust of the amendment. There is no commercialism in it. We do mention economics, but then again so does the government. Clause 191B mentions economic benefits. We are not saying that they are the ultimate benefits to be looked at. They are just one of several, as Senator Evans has said himself. We are saying that it is just a question of clarity, function and direction of the Indigenous Land Corporation. As Senator Chamarette said, I believe that the question of `or' is a red herring. Our amendment affords a discretion to the ILC to administer its functions accordingly. During evidence before the standing committee which I have mentioned, Senator Evans conceded:</PARA>

<PARA>That is on page 48 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. That was in answer to a question I put to Senator Evans about this very aspect. The Indigenous Land Corporation will be faced with some very difficult decisions. It needs to have some guidance when it comes to those difficult decisions. That is all we are offering it&mdash;some particularity of purpose. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can I just make one further short comment on this. If we are giving direction or guidance to the rudderless ship, as Senator Ellison puts it, it is very important to give that guidance in a way which is genuinely responsive to perceived needs of Aboriginal people. There are a lot of different kinds of needs which can be satisfied by grants of land. Some needs are essentially economic in character. I suppose some are welfare in character, such as the need for land in order to provide a location for a building of some particular hospital, school or other service. Some needs are cultural, social or, as we have been saying, spiritual in character. It may be that a particular grant of land will be such as to be able to satisfy multiple needs simultaneously, but sometimes it may involve choice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is important is that the corporation be able to have that choice, that flexibility and that responsiveness and, on some occasions, be able to simply make a grant of land for one kind of reason only, to meet one kind of need&mdash;a social or cultural need&mdash;and not to have to address these other sorts of needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the legislation stands at the moment, the corporation has that discretion and flexibility without any let, inhibition or hindrance. It can make that judgment because the general guidance that it is given in clause 191B is in terms of meeting `economic, environmental, social or cultural' needs, conferring benefits of one or other of those kinds&mdash;maybe multiple, but one or other if it comes to the pinch. So there is ample discretion as it stands at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once those opposite start writing in a further set of criteria of this kind to which the corporation must have regard, they have to look very carefully at what those criteria do by way of reducing flexibility and the discretion which would otherwise be there. They are not giving helpful guidance to a rudderless ship if they are locking the corporation in and reducing its discretion. It may be that these amendments are drafted in a way in which, as we have said before, they do not mean anything at all. But if they do mean something&mdash;those opposite seem to want them to mean something; and I think that in practice, with the way the courts are interpreting law at the moment, they probably would mean something&mdash;they are requiring the corporation, before it makes any grant of land, to look at the grant of land against these cumulative criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts have to look at the question of viability, but they are not just making up their own minds on what viability means and whether it means empowerment in some of the senses that Senator Harradine has mentioned; they have to look at what viability means in the way those opposite have drafted it. Viability in the way they have drafted it means looking at viability through a particular set of spectacles. It means looking at viability in a way that takes into account and addresses a whole variety of things&mdash;health, housing, education, economic, social and cultural needs&mdash;in a cumulative fashion. The cumulative impact of having to look at viability defined in that way by reference to those kinds of criteria is to require the corporation to look at the whole question in a different way from the way it would if its discretion and judgment were unfettered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this again fails to appreciate&mdash;and I will make the point quickly again&mdash;is that land does have a use for Aboriginal people that sometimes is not easily or readily perceived by the rest of us, in circumstances where European-style services are not proposed to be plonked upon it or where it is not proposed to derive formal economic use from it. </PARA>

<PARA>That is an extreme way of making the point&mdash;and I am not suggesting that those opposite are being as insensitive in their intentions or motivations as to do that. But I am saying that it is crucially important to give full recognition to that dimension of Aboriginal need for land; a need sometimes, in some circumstances, just to have land for land's sake, just to sit on it or walk across it&mdash;scrub land, empty though it may appear to other senators or to me&mdash;not to do anything economically viable on it, not to deliver a welfare service or add viability to the community through those other criteria, but just to have it because it is land. It is a very important thing for Aboriginal people to be able to have in some situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I genuinely think that with the way the legislation is crafted with this amendment, the opposition does not make it readily possible for the corporation to just look at a particular kind of grant of land as being defensible, legitimate and available under the legislation&mdash;just for those sorts of reasons. No, the opposition says that viability must be looked at, and it must be looked at by reference to a cumulative set of criteria which go way beyond just that concept. That is the problem we face with this amendment. I will not say anything more; I think I have made the point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a couple of additional matters that can usefully be considered. The first thing that I think needs to be kept in mind is that, when we talk about viability, we are talking about the ability to develop and survive independently. As I said earlier, I would be very surprised indeed if the government were arguing that there is merit in transferring land even if the end result was that a person was not viable. In other words, a person can transfer land in order to achieve some other purpose than the simple acquisition of land per se. That is why the purposes part of the bill goes on to specify a number of, let us say, material characteristics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we get to that point together, then I think the argument simply becomes whether `and' or `or' makes the difference. I think we are in heated agreement in that regard. We are not arguing that the ILC would need to be satisfied on each and every one of those criteria. The legislation says that they must have regard to the need to improve the viability of the land, including by addressing. Addressing does not mean they have to be satisfied that each and every one of those characteristics or criteria has to be satisfied. It simply means that they will look at those criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will not look at those criteria in some very scientific and quantitative manner. They will have regard to each of those factors because they are in themselves various examples of viability. Having done that, they can then be satisfied that any one of those will improve the viability of the community. What they are doing is simply considering a range of criteria but, at the end of the day, they only have to be satisfied that one at least would achieve or assist in achieving viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really all the government's purposes argue. It is not sufficient to simply assist in the acquisition of land or to manage land. There have to be economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits. One will do. The government may prefer to say that cultural benefits are the most important because that has a spiritual connotation, but it has to concede logically that there may be circumstances in which it is only the economic benefits that demonstrate results from the transfer. That quite properly reflects the enormous diversity and variations that exist from Carnarvon to Fitzroy. That is what this amendment achieves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect, I do not think that there is at the end of the day a cumulative requirement at all. The language is not expressed in those terms. The term `addressing' I would have thought, to give its proper and natural meaning, means that we simply have to look at things. It does not mean that we have to be satisfied that each of those exist to a sufficient extent. We simply have to look at them. They are the means of satisfying people that they are improving the viability of the community. I would have thought that perhaps where we end up differing is that the government says that viability is not necessary and we do. I do not think we should pretend that somehow we are requiring satisfaction on all of those matters when the government would probably say one is enough. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had this debate to quite some extent. The fact remains that, by merely stating a bill of rights or a charter of citizenship rights, we do not necessarily achieve anything. It is nice and pious and we feel good about it but it does not get us anywhere. That is why the government in its purposes does not simply say that we establish the ILC to acquire and manage land. It says that we do it for a purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose, if you like, is non-spiritual. It can be any one of a number of purposes; maybe spiritual is sufficient in itself. But we have an additional dimension simply because in the great majority of cases the people that we are trying to assist lack one or, in many cases, many of what we regard as basic human entitlements or citizenship rights. They are all variations on the theme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this legislation is to get to a point where we are making a difference. With this legislation, making a difference means providing an economic, environmental, social or cultural benefit. It is not a big step from that to saying, `Why are we doing that? Are we doing that simply so people can say they have some right or benefit? Or is it because we want to make a difference to their quality of life?' That is when we get to the point of looking at viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose viability is a nebulous concept in some respects. As the dictionary defines it, it is the ability to develop and survive independently. The very least we should expect of citizens of Australia is that they have the ability to survive on their own. If land is a necessary prerequisite, it will lead to an improvement in their viability. All the other things are simply examples of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the cultural example, which Senator Evans would define as including the spiritual dimension, that pretty well takes us back to where we want to be: we give people land to which they have a spiritual attachment&mdash;not to that particular piece of land, because this fund is for those who are unable to satisfy the other criteria&mdash;because it is important to them, because it is empowering, because it has a cultural or spiritual dimension, or, to put it another way, a non-material or non-economic benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But having done that, we have given viability because people then have the ability to develop and survive independently. In other words, they have thrown off the shackles. They have the land&mdash;that is the sine qua non&mdash;and they can progress from there. So at the end of the day we are not very far apart. We may vary in expression but everyone accepts the very great significance of the land. It is a matter of whether we go beyond that and ask what it will lead to.

I still say that. I have been down that track plenty of times. I have written a fair number of rules in my day in the trade union sphere, probably most of which are very impartial and democratic. Those rules contain an objects clause, for example. The TTLC did have an objects clause which is very much similar to that of the ILO. Actually, when I became secretary of the Labour Council I changed the words to read, `to contribute to the economic and social order in which persons can live with freedom and dignity and pursue both their spiritual development and material well-being in conditions of economic security and equal opportunity.' That is the object. Here we have passed an objects clause&mdash;not in precisely the same terms&mdash;which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The object of this Part is to assist those dispossessed Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to meet their economic, cultural and spiritual aspirations with acquisition and management of land.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the object. A lot of things are in the object. It is important to have the policy in the objects clause. But when it gets down to the actual practical clauses, particularly a clause such as this which is really directing the ILC in its acquisition and land management decisions to have regard to certain things, I think the wording is vital. In my view, the word `or' should be there. So I foreshadow an amendment to the second last line of the opposition's amendment to delete the word `and' and insert the word `or'. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment follows on from clause 191D that we have just been discussing. I apologise for the lateness of its circulation; it was circulated this afternoon. This amendment adds another section to the end of 191D because, at present, the bill makes no attempt to ensure that the relevant traditional owners are consulted before land is acquired by the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any government agency, particularly any agency which the government purports to be an indigenous organisation, should be careful to respect the traditional ownership of the land. This is made all the more necessary when the land acquired will be, by definition, freehold title or leases where the native title is therefore very likely to have been extinguished. As such, there will be no claims over the land and therefore no legal signs of continuing connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause was one of the five consensus issues which we understand were agreed at a meeting of Aboriginal people in Melbourne last week. That is the reason why we have circulated it so late. It was of concern to Queensland members of that group who brought it to our attention. We felt it was an appropriate addition and commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has not been made aware of any consensus position by the Aboriginal representatives to whom Senator Chamarette refers. I am not suggesting there was not, but we have not been formally made aware of it. We would certainly want to discuss that with the people concerned before accepting it because, again, there are a number of problems with the provision. As with so many of these innocuous looking things that are put in, it sounds good. `Consult with traditional owners before exercising any function' and so on&mdash;yes, that sounds plausible and credible, but how does it work in practice?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases it may not be readily possible to identify any traditional owners of the land in question, but there may be some ambiguity about the possibility of there being traditional owners. There will be a need in at least some situations where the possibility of traditional ownership is real. I am not suggesting that that is very likely in urban Victoria or somewhere like that, but in a lot of other cases it may well be real. Then at least one has to go down a research path in trying to establish who might be traditional owners, which would be the equivalent to the kind of research we have to do and the process we have to follow under the Native Title Act or the Northern Territory land rights act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot just assume that there is a core of people walking around with placards around their necks saying they are traditional owners for particular pieces of land about whom there will be no difficulty in making an identification and in relation to whom there will not be any potential squabbles. There is all sorts of potential for squabbles in particular indigenous communities where the situation might be thought applicable because of disputes about who are traditional owners. We are all familiar with those. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because if we are creating a statutory obligation to consult traditional owners, we have to be in a position of clearly being able to identify who the traditional owners are that we are consulting. Those opposite cannot just make it up as they go along, in the way Senator Alston seems to be making up his response to half the things that he is waxing lyrical about in the course of this debate. If those opposite are writing statutory language, if they are creating obligations, if they are creating justiciable obligations such that mandamus or something will lie at the instance of the disaffected if they do not like what the corporation is doing, they have to be a hell of a lot clearer about what they are doing, why they are doing it and the workability of it than they are being in this particular instance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, at the very least we have the prospect of delay, the prospect of inability to deal further with land in question while these processes are working themselves out, additions to administrative costs and additions to the potential for litigation. So bit by bit those opposite make this legislation more impractical, more unworkable. I suggest that this is another example of just that phenomenon at work. Bit by bit they are making more inevitable the utter inability of this legislation, if it is passed by the Senate, to be put into practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Bit by bit, Senator Evans is exposing the political motives behind the government's tactic on this bill. He has just impugned the motives of the Greens and of many of the Aboriginal people who met in Melbourne last week, but we will disregard that. I am sure Senator Chamarette will deal with that in her own way. Clearly, this government is trying to create a whole bunch of reasons why it cannot live with this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has made up its mind already that it will take the bill back to the House of Representatives, chuck it back over here and cause a double dissolution trigger. That was on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> last night. That is his game. Bit by bit, as it gets later in the night, as Senator Evans gets tired and looks forward to jumping on a plane and rushing off to the United Nations to sign another treaty, and as he gets more frustrated and angry, his real motives come out. He has just exposed them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two weeks ago we agreed, in what I thought was a spirit of cooperation, to an amendment that said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Indigenous Land Corporation must take reasonable steps, including, where it deems it appropriate, making a non-claimant application within the meaning of section 67 of the Native Title Act, to inform itself whether any interest to be acquired in land is subject to native title or native title rights and interests. . .</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For Senator Kernot's assistance, because this is the quickest way of finding it, I am reading from page 2139 of the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of Thursday, 20 October. That amendment was agreed to by Senator Evans when standing behind the President, scratching on a bit of paper. It sought to achieve the principle that, when the ILC buys some land, it should first ascertain whether or not there is a traditional owner around or someone who might assert native title rights, and not tread on the rights of those people who, Senator Gareth Evans explained so eloquently earlier this evening, required, sought and hungered for some link with their traditional lands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All Senator Chamarette is doing is saying that the ILC, in performing its land acquisition function, must take all reasonable steps to consult with the traditional owners. Again, Senator Evans has gone to his advisers and said, `Let's create all these nasty, technical problems with this set of words to build me some sort of argument to knock over what is otherwise an entirely reasonable and principled amendment to the act.' It is entirely in accordance with the amendment that the Senate passed not two weeks ago&mdash;on Thursday, 20 October&mdash;saying that the ILC should have regard to the traditional owners of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There may be areas of Australia where they have no requirement whatsoever because the traditional owners have been dispossessed, they have no native title rights, and it is quite clear that the ILC is not required to do that. Where there is any possibility of a traditional owner being associated with the land, it would be an absolute travesty of the rights of those people for the ILC to not consult with them. That is what this amendment is requiring, and that is why the coalition will support it. It reasserts the principle that we have already supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether there is a deliberate effort to be a muddle-headed wombat, or whether Senator Chamarette cannot help&mdash;along with the opposition&mdash;making a reference to the amendment that we passed earlier concerning checking whether or not there might be a native title claim. If Senator Chamarette does not understand the difference between, on the one hand, satisfying oneself as to whether there may be some native title claim or some native title interest in relation to the land in question and, on the other hand, satisfying oneself as to who are the actual traditional owners who can derive the benefit of that native title interest or claim that might be around, then she has not been focusing on what this legislation is all about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to have the potential for a native title claim because there is a group of people, at least some of whom have some prima facie continuing attachment to the land in question such as to make likely or possible the probability of the existence of a native title claim; it is quite another matter to move from there to establish who the actual traditional owners are. These things are riddled with a whole heap of potential for argument as to who are going to be the beneficiaries if there is a claim in existence. Who are the traditional owners? This is where we get into intra-communal discussions. That is exactly the sort of thing that is in issue here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILC has an obligation not just to satisfy itself as to whether or not there might be a native title claim, but it has an obligation, first of all, to identify who the actual traditional owners are because unless and until they are identified there is no-one to consult with. In that case we are talking about a potentially onerous obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an area that has been the subject of its own rapidly evolving litigation culture, with a lot of people who see themselves as standing to gain or lose through these situations, these sorts of arguments are ones that lend themselves to a lot of implications in terms of the workability of the legislation. I am not trying to make this legislation unworkable. I am not trying to create artificial problems where none exist.

But, at the end of the day, one just has to make a judgment as to whether this legislation is going to work.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated a willingness to compromise where compromise is possible, consistent with the philosophy and the integrity of this legislation. If we compare the nature of the debate that has taken place here with that which has taken place in the House of Representatives, we see that there has been a serious minded attempt to respond to each of the issues that has been raised. There has been no cavalier dismissal of points, no throwaway references. I will fight clause by clause to get a workable piece of legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to say that, until this point in time, the debate has generally been carried on on all sides of the chamber with a fair degree of goodwill and determination to exchange sensible differences of opinion and to achieve common ground as much as possible. But what we have just heard shows a very dark side to the government's political agenda. Senator Gareth Evans is essentially trying to argue that in some circumstances the traditional owner cannot readily be identified. That is boiling his point down. Yet, with a very clumsy display of sophistry, he completely and utterly ignores the fact that the amendment says that all reasonable steps must be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, in the odd circumstance, it were not possible to identify the traditional owners, by definition, everything would have been done as could reasonably be expected to have been done and the obligations satisfied. But Senator Evans is trying by device to say, `Because it may just be possible in some circumstances that the traditional owners are not readily apparent, we want to dispose of any obligation to consult with them.' Yet that is what should be at the heart of this legislation. That is what he really should be concerned about above all. If there are traditional owners, surely they have paramount entitlements. They are the ones we need the talk to. They are the ones we need to deal with in the first instance, rather than going through quite unnecessary processes and finding out late in the day that what the ILC seeks to do will be disputed by the traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is the low watermark of the night, quite frankly, for Senator Evans to be deliberately ignoring that requirement to take all reasonable steps in an attempt to fabricate some sense of unworkability about a proposition which, on its very face, is designed to allow for situations where it may not be possible to consult the traditional owners but it is still possible to do what should be done. If Senator Evans, by that sort of device, is going to argue that somehow there should be no obligation to consult, that there is no purpose achieved, he is really revealing his political agenda. I think it is a sorry point that we have reached in this debate. I hope that we very quickly start to move upwards from here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I raise my concern about yet another example of the recent mismanagement of the ABC by the Minister for Communications and the Arts and the federal government&mdash;this time with regard to allegations involving corruption, kickbacks and bribes within our national broadcaster. Some weeks ago I received complaints from a former ABC employee in Adelaide that information which he had forwarded to the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, had not been handled appropriately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It transpired that, as long ago as February this year, this person had made allegations to the minister's office verbally and subsequently in writing that secret financial inducements&mdash;bribes&mdash;had been given to three ABC managers in Adelaide by private contractors in return for these firms receiving contracts for services required by the ABC. Two Adelaide firms were alleged to be providing these financial kickbacks to senior ABC executives on a regular basis. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Chapman</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 21 September 1994 about allegations of corruption within the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I received a letter from an ABC employee on 10 March 1994 containing allegations of misconduct/ fraud by ABC officers in South Australia. I referred these allegations to the ABC Chairman for investigation on the 6 April 1994. The Chairman of the ABC responded on the 16 May 1994 advising that the matters referred had been investigated by a senior officer from the ABC's head office. The investigation was unable to find any evidence of fraud to support the allegations raised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. This reply confirmed his awareness of the allegations and his referral of the matter to the ABC chairman on 6 April 1994. Professor Armstrong in turn replied to the minister on 16 May 1994 claiming that the matter had been investigated and that the ABC found no evidence of fraud to support the allegations. What else would we expect when the minister has so grossly mishandled this issue?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a whole month the minister ignored the information provided on several occasions by my constituent in telephone calls to the minister's office from February 1994. Another month went by and the minister again ignored the same information provided to him in writing on 10 March 1994. Then, on 6 April, he asked the chairman of the ABC to investigate and, surprise, surprise, the ABC sent its own investigator to Adelaide to look into the matter. Naturally, he found no evidence of fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course he was unable to find anything. As soon as this tame cat internal investigation commenced, those about whom these allegations had been made found out on the ABC internal grapevine and the fraudulent gravy train was stopped dead in its tracks. No wonder no evidence was found! The perpetrators had time to sweep their illegal activities under the carpet. At best, the failure to apprehend the culprits was due to the minister's incompetence in handling the matter. At worst, perhaps he handled it in this way as a means of deliberately avoiding yet another embarrassment at the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely, as these allegations involved possible criminal offences, the minister was duty bound to immediately refer them to the Australian Federal Police instead of sitting on the information for two months before initiating an ineffective, half-hearted internal investigation. The minister stands condemned for failing to take the appropriate action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter to me, the minister says these allegations must be treated seriously and investigated thoroughly, and yet he has failed to refer the allegations to the most appropriate authority&mdash;the Australian Federal Police. One wonders what sort of sideshow this incompetent minister is running, having Caesar investigate Caesar. But this whole sorry saga gets worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 27 October, the Australian Federal Police contacted me and subsequently met me in my Adelaide office to discuss these allegations and to seek my assistance. When they arrived, I assumed that the minister had finally advised the Australian Federal Police to look into the serious allegations of corruption in the ABC. But he still had not. The Federal Police told me that they learned about the complaints from Telstra eight months after the minister had initially been informed of the allegations. It was a full eight months and still the minister had not advised the Federal Police, but the Federal Police in fact found out about this matter, as I said, from Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response concerning these serious allegations is transparent. He is really saying, `I told the ABC and they couldn't find anything.' The police regard the minister's failure to refer the investigation to them at the outset as highly irregular. His actions have effectively undermined their capacity to conduct an effective investigation at this late stage. One would at least think that, now that the police are involved, the minister would release to them the many letters, internal investigation files and briefing notes of which his office has possession. But no, when my office contacted the Australian Federal Police in South Australia earlier today, the minister had still not made this information available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the question again: why has the minister failed to have this matter properly and fully investigated? Of what is he so afraid? The Australian Federal Police have a capable team of investigators to handle such allegations involving Commonwealth officers. In fact, under section 73 of the Crimes Act, the Australian Federal Police are empowered to investigate matters pertaining to corruption and bribery of Commonwealth officers. But the best the minister can do is casually pass the allegations on to the ABC to investigate itself with no outside accountability or scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again we have witnessed the appalling manner in which this government has failed to be publicly accountable when it comes to the proper administration of justice in this country. I can only hope that, despite the incompetence of the minister for communications in handling this serious issue, there might still be some hope of success for the recent inquiries commenced by the Australian Federal Police. It remains to be seen what damage the minister's failure to advise the appropriate authorities has done. Whatever the outcome, the minister is guilty of gross mismanagement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The distribution of Navy, Army, Air Force and Defence public service personnel by State and Territory as at 30 June 1994 is below at Table 1. For comparative purposes, figures for 1992 have been included at Table 2.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The reasons for significant movement between States are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAVY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The numbers of personnel serving in NSW/ACT have fallen primarily due to the closure of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nirimba </EMPHASIS>and the transfer of some of its functions to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus </EMPHASIS>in Victoria. Other reasons for the decrease in numbers include the progressive implementation of the Government's two ocean basing policy which will eventually result in half of the destroyer force and the majority of the submarine force being based in Western Australia. These changes have led to associated increases in the number of personnel serving in Victoria and in Western Australia. The decrease in the number of personnel serving in the Northern Territory is due to the rationalisation of functions previously carried out at Shoal Bay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ARMY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The significant movements of personnel between States have primarily been a result of changes caused by the Force Structure Review (FSR), Defence Regional Support Review (DRSR) and the Army Personnel In the North initiative. NSW/ACT had a reduction of personnel due to the FSR drawdown and 2 Cavalry Regiment's move to Darwin (which led to an increase in the number of personnel in the Northern Territory). Victoria had a reduction of personnel due to the FSR drawdown, Commercial Support Program (CSP) contracts and DRSR initiatives. Queensland had a reduction of personnel due to 6 Brigade becoming a Ready Reserve force and CSP contract activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIR FORCE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decrease of personnel in NSW/ACT has been brought about by reductions in numbers at Stores Depots under the DLRP and commercialisation or civilianisation under CSP. Victoria had a reduction of personnel over the same period, generated by devolution of functions from Headquarters Logistics Command (HQLC) Melbourne to bases and the closure of units. Numbers in Western Australia have declined, principally due to commercialisation under CSP. The increase of personnel in South Australia was caused by functional transfers from HQLC, a build up at the Aircraft Research and Development Unit and the establishment of a new unit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CIVILIAN</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to Defence civilian personnel relate to restructuring arising from Defence initiatives including the FSR, the DRSR, the CSP and the Defence Logistics Redevelopment Project (DLRP).</PARA>
