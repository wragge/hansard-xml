<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia opposes the reduction of octane quality of leaded petrol from January 1994, resulting from the Government's `Lead Roundtable' meeting. The petitioners note particularly that this reduction in petrol quality:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Jeopardises the use of vehicles made prior to 1986 for operation on high octane petrol and could lead to many of those vehicles suffering serious engine damage;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The regulations provide for the Civil Aviation Authority to give directions and instructions which apparently are not subject to gazettal, tabling or disallowance. Nevertheless, breach of these provisions may result in a penalty of $5,000. The committee has written to the minister, asking that this legislation be made subject to appropriate parliamentary scrutiny.

Six of the individual regulations also provide that a contravention of these directions or instructions is an offence punishable by 50 penalty points, or $5,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The directions or instructions do not appear to be subject to gazettal, tabling or disallowance. The Committee is concerned at this, believing that it is inappropriate for a statutory authority to make legislation, including offence provisions with substantial penalties, which is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations do require the directions and instructions to be published in Aeronautical Information Publications and Notices to Airmen. These publications, however, also do not appear to be subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has received helpful advice from the former Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator the Hon Bob Collins, that the Civil Aviation Regulations will progressively replace other instruments of delegated legislation. The Committee believes that as part of this process the mandatory provisions which are permitted to be made under these Regulations should be either included in the Regulations or at least be subject to appropriate parliamentary scrutiny, including disallowance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus bill which provides for a range of mainly administrative amendments to be made to the Patents Act 1990, the Trade Marks Act 1955 and the Designs Act 1906. The Australian Democrats support most of these provisions in the bill, and we support the bill as a whole. However, there are some matters of concern, mainly related to the delegation of powers and to the possible extension of powers of the registrar by regulation, which I will address later in greater detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the topic of delegation of statutory functions, which is a major part of the bill. The background is that the Australian Industrial Property Organisation is a division of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. The Director-General of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation also has statutory functions as the commissioner of patents, registrar of trade marks and registrar of designs. In order to allow the director-general to place more emphasis on his management responsibilities, the bill amends the Patents Act, the Trade Marks Act and the Designs Act to delegate the director-general's statutory functions to be carried out by the head of each of the relevant offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far so good. The Australian Democrats have no issue with the amendments thus far. However, the bill goes further to allow those statutory officeholders to then delegate their powers and functions to any public service employee who is employed in the relevant office. Thus, public service employees&mdash;and they are not designated employees&mdash;would be able to summons witnesses, receive evidence on oath, orally or otherwise, require the production of documents or articles and award costs against a party to proceedings before the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that it is simply not appropriate for such semi-judicial powers to be performed by any public service employee in the relevant office. As I have already mentioned, in the committee stage we shall move amendments which will require the class of public service employees who may exercise such powers in each of the relevant offices to be prescribed by regulation at least. We believe that the government should go thus far and consciously consider who should have these powers delegated to him or her so that we do not have wide open delegation of powers to the extent that the act currently provides, which we consider totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I wish to raise is the matter of the powers of the registrar. The bill provides that the powers and functions of the head of each of the relevant offices, that is, the registrars of trade marks, designs and patents, are conferred under this act or any other act or `regulations made under this Act or any other Act'. It is this latter problem that we wish to address by another amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats find it inappropriate for the registrars' powers and functions to be capable of being increased, diminished or changed without the correct process of full parliamentary scrutiny. Thus, in the committee stage I will be moving an amendment to the bill to remove any conferral of registrars' powers by legislation, which means that, if these powers are to be changed, they must be changed by legislation and properly scrutinised and debated in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other matters contained in this bill that I wish to address briefly. The first is the extension of eligibility as a convention country. The current pieces of patent, trade marks and designs legislation each recognise a right of priority for convention applications, that is, applications made in countries which are a signatory to international conventions dealing with the protection of industrial property. This priority enables an application for a patent, trade mark or design in a convention country to be treated as if it had been filed in Australia on the same day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment to the Designs Act and to the Trade Marks Act enables regulations to be made declaring a country a convention country where a bilateral agreement has been entered into concerning the protection of industrial property rights. The Patents Act 1990 already makes provision for these purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item in this bill that I wish to address is the correction of entries on the register of designs. This is a very sensible amendment which will enable the registrar of designs to correct an entry in the register for the purposes of correcting a clerical error or obvious mistake. This circumvents the expensive procedure which currently exists whereby an application of the registered owner of the design must be referred to the Federal Court or to a state supreme court to have changes made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I come to the extension of the industry innovations program and the inclusion of a sunset clause. The amendments to this bill provide for an extension of the government's industry innovation program to December 1995. The industry innovation program comprises the 150 per cent tax concession for research and development, as well as a range of discretionary grants for innovation, research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Audit Office reviewed the administrative efficiency of the tax concession during 1993 and produced a very scathing report. The Auditor-General found it impossible to assess the effectiveness of the incentive provided by the Australian taxpayer to companies engaging in research and development because the responsible government instrumentalities&mdash;the Industry Research and Development Board and the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;had failed to set up any comprehensive assessment criteria for the scheme. It was, therefore, very difficult for anyone, including the Auditor-General, to determine whether the 150 per cent tax concession was worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, it is. There is probably a very good case to consider increasing it to 200 per cent in the forthcoming budget, as Singapore has done. We all know that the economy in Singapore is surging ahead, not least because of the performance of some of its innovative products which have been spawned by the superior research and development activities in that country. However, it is difficult to argue for the increase and to get the government to accept its responsibility to support the research and development activities of industrial enterprises when the bureaucrats responsible for administration and assessment do not provide us with adequate criteria and an adequate system to enable us to clearly assess the value of that concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that I mentioned was tabled in the Senate on 22 December 1993. At that time, I called upon the responsible minister, Senator Schacht, to provide the Senate with a progress report as soon as possible as to the remedial action which would be taken to rectify this extremely unsatisfactory situation. I regret to say that so far we have not heard anything further on this matter. Therefore, while the Australian Democrats welcome the government's continuing assistance to Australian industry to undertake research and development through this program and the complementary assistance of the 150 per cent tax concession, it would be reassuring to know that assessment criteria are now in place which are capable of indicating that further expenditure on research and development is producing results in assisting our industries to become more competitive in international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, the Australian Democrats support the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. However, I hope that the government and the opposition will support the two amendments that I will be moving during the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Industry Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 seeks to make a number of uncontentious amendments to existing legislation within the portfolio of industry, technology and regional development. It contains amendments to the Designs Act 1906, the Patents Act 1990 and the Trademarks Act 1955 to facilitate administrative arrangements for the new Australian industry property organisation. It contains provisions for standardisation of convention country provisions in line with the Patents Act 1990, and also simplification of procedures for minor corrections of entries in the register of designs. It also provides for extension of the termination date to 31 December 1995 for the discretionary and generic technology grants scheme under the industry innovation program.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Spindler mentioned in his speech that he will be moving amendments, and the coalition will support those amendments as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the bill provides an appropriate opportunity to have a brief look at the important nature of industry policy and the forthcoming industry statement to be delivered by the new Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, Senator Cook. We are not sure what is going to be in that industry statement because it appears that the recent change in minister is likely to lead to a different direction in the context of the policy. </PARA>

Anyone who can follow what this government is thinking about in terms of the nature of industry policy, the role of government in its policy, looks in vain for any consistent pattern. That is indicative in particular of an overall lack of policy direction by this government, and of an increasingly weak, second-rate front bench which makes it impossible for any government to formulate good, strong and consistent policy direction. </PARA>

Although I did not name him in that context of the front bench, he would have to be a person that comes to the forefront of my mind. His disgraceful performance in relation to the Customs Service, which was acknowledged in the statement he made yesterday, provided ample testimony of this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do know is what will not be in the industry statement, that is, any genuine attempt at the real reforms that are necessary in this country if we are going to make ourselves an internationally competitive nation on a sustainable basis. That involves reform in a range of major areas. The number one area, of course, is reform in industrial relations, because unless there is that reform in industrial relations and the necessary flexibility in labour market practices, one will not achieve the productivity gains or the other improvements that are necessary to improve our competitiveness and efficiency in those essential infrastructure type industries and sectors, such as telecommunications, transport, and the like. This Labor government seems really to have given up on these two crucial issues, that is, micro-economic reform following industrial relations, having failed adequately to address those issues over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the government and its ministers constantly lecture business on being internationally competitive, the government religiously fails to practise what it preaches. A recent survey of 5,000 Australian businesses by the firm KPMG Peat Marwick identified labour oncosts as the most significant barriers to further investment in Australia. Sixty-one per cent of the respondents to the survey mentioned labour oncosts as a major inhibiting factor to further investment, and therefore, of course, to growth of their firms and industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as other government influences like labour costs and the failure of industrial relations policy, between 43 per cent and 50 per cent mentioned government charges. I hope Senator Schacht will note that uncertainty of government decision making was mentioned by no less than 47 per cent of the survey respondents as being a major inhibiting factor to the development of their businesses. That highlights very starkly what I said before: there has been this total inconsistency of government policy throughout the period of the Hawke and Keating governments which has held back Australia from realising the enormous potential that we would have if we were to get our act right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour oncosts are one of the major impediments that Australian industry has to being world competitive, but other government imposed bureaucratic proposals&mdash;the superannuation guarantee levy, the training guarantee levy and the like&mdash;are very heavy imposts on business and impose restrictions on our ability to compete. I plead with the government to take into account in its industry policy statement to be brought down shortly that we cannot solve industry's problems by doling out money to it or by attempting to pick winners. That policy has been disastrous in the past. We need straightforward, across-the-board decisions that lead to cost reductions for business and industry and, therefore, provide the opportunity to increase their productivity and their competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am encouraged by the fact that Senator Cook's trade background, limited in time though it was, seems from his initial statements to have convinced him about the pointless nature of sectoral policies or handouts. I commend Senator Cook for his earlier remark on this subject that `the era of the handout is dead'. However, I caution him that rhetoric alone is absolutely insufficient and that we need substance to justify that correct assertion that he makes. If he has a look&mdash;as I hope he has done by now&mdash;at the costs of the various schemes and proposals in his new portfolio, he will find that a very large handout mentality remains, which is not doing Australian industry any good; indeed, it is doing the contrary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any new minister has a responsibility, as Senator Schacht presumably well knows, to look at his portfolio across the board. I hope that Senator Cook will do that. However, I suspect that, at the end of the day, once again the trade union movement and the Labor caucus will fail to embrace an internationally orientated and competitive industry structure. Instead, I can see every prospect of them patting themselves on the back, mouthing empty platitudes and rhetoric&mdash;as they did on industrial relations, corporate law and taxation reform&mdash;and simply allowing the throwing of more money at schemes rather than tackling the fundamental underlying problems that still bedevil so many sections of Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look across the Tasman to New Zealand to see what can happen and the benefits that can be derived from a truly open, reformed and competitive nation. There, people are looking at six per cent economic growth; they are looking at sustained trade surpluses after their country being the absolute basket case of the Western world only five or 10 years ago so far as its competitiveness was concerned. At the same time, they are achieving those things in the context of a growing job environment for, although it is still far too high, nonetheless, there has been a progressive fall in unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Across the other side of the Pacific, the United States has a deregulated labour market and in the past 60 years unemployment there has never exceeded eight per cent. It is now under seven per cent. Investment and exports are rising strongly, and there is four per cent-plus economic growth. Authorities in the United States are even looking at the need for some increase in interest rates&mdash;though only to 3 1/4 per cent&mdash;to dampen any unsustainable growth in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in Australia for the first time in four years we are starting to regain some confidence with 3 1/2 per cent growth, which of course is 2 1/2 per cent if one adjusts for population increases. But Australia still has a $17 billion current account deficit facing it this year, still has around 11 per cent unemployment, and still has the dreadful burden around its neck of a foreign debt that is of the order of $200 billion. So although I welcome the growth that is now starting to re-emerge, I must point out that in looking at the fundamentals of the Australian economy we really compare very badly with some of the other countries that I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly I acknowledge that there has been some improvement in our competitiveness, although most of it has been due to the devaluation of the Australian dollar. In the long term there is no way that one can build progressively and sustainably a nation's competitiveness just on the basis of devaluing one's currency. A devaluation of the currency in itself is initially a fall in a nation's standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst there have been some improvements in our competitiveness and some micro-economic reforms, which I do not deny, this government fails to realise that it is just not good enough to be playing limited catch-up with our competition. As a nation we have to be getting ahead of our competition. All we managed to do throughout the 1980s was reduce the rate of our decline, not actually turn it around. Neighbours such as Hong Kong, Singapore and others in the Asian region, particularly in the South-East Asian region, now have higher per capita living standards than we do&mdash;a thought that would have been incomprehensible to us here in Australia 20 years ago&mdash;and continue to show much better future growth prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is a great deal to be done in the whole area of industry reform. There is a great deal that industry itself has to do, but there is also much that government can do. In particular it can get out of the way of industry to enable it to get its costs down, to be more competitive and to compete internationally in the way that is absolutely essential if we want to have the increase in living standards and the quality of life to which we aspire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those matters are more importantly the subject for debate on another day when we see the whites of the eyes of the government's industry policy, but they are points that I wanted to make today in the context of the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill, which the opposition does not oppose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of remarks about Senator Short's contribution to this debate. The honourable senator mentioned the forthcoming industry statement. He also spoke about the policies of the government relating to the industry area as well as a number of other areas of the portfolio that are covered in what is, in effect, a mini-omnibus bill. I am a little astonished that Senator Short made remarks about the disarray in government policy and the different indications given by the government to the community about the expectations in the forthcoming industry statement. If Senator Short looks carefully at the statements made by the former minister, Mr Griffiths, and the new minister, Senator Cook, he will see that there is a quite genuine consistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year Mr Griffiths made it quite clear that the days of relying on high protection, on quotas, and on tariffs to protect industry in Australia&mdash;and therefore ending up with industry that is not international competitive&mdash;were finished; that that debate had gone. In consultation with industry, he was looking for ideas on how we can enhance the international competitiveness of our industries. Senator Cook, since taking over, has emphasised that there is no handout mentality and that we will always be looking at ways to enhance our international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no inconsistency between the two ministers. Certainly, when the statement is completed and presented to the people and the parliament, those opposite will note that it is an industry statement that sees Australian industry into the 21st century as being internationally competitive and technologically advanced, with Australians being able to maintain themselves by having an expanding manufacturing base that not only can service the needs of the Australian community but also can export to the world. We have all seen in recent years endless figures and statistics on how the level of Australian manufactures has been rapidly growing&mdash;the highest growing area of our exports overall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little surprised at the suggestion by Senator Short that we still have a handout mentality in the department and in our policies in areas of industry. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"> </EMPHASIS>I was making the point that the portfolio has a number of programs that are very beneficial to industry and are not part of a handout mentality. For example, one of them is the 150 per cent tax concession. All industries within the portfolio that I talk to are very supportive of that. They do not see it as being a handout mentality. They see it as a way of encouraging technology and scientific invention in this country. They also see it as a way of encouraging Australian firms to be more innovative and to develop products, through proper investment in R&amp;D, that are not only able to be used in Australia but also are world competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also refers to an extension of the GIRD grants and the sunset clause. The government has committed further money to the end of 1995 for these grants to Australian industry to turn new ideas into products&mdash;an excellent scheme which has been well supported by industry. The scheme does not foster a handout mentality in those companies that cannot support themselves; it assists industry to develop good ideas over time to obtain a commercial or market outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reject Senator Short's accusation that the government is in disarray. Yesterday, I personally experienced the disarray of the opposition. I made a major announcement about the reform of the Australian Customs Service. When I held a press conference, Senator Bishop attended even though she is not the shadow minister responsible for customs. She apparently made a number of announcements on behalf of the coalition without discussing them with the shadow minister, Mr Prosser.

<PARA>I will briefly address amendments Nos 2, 4 and 6, which relate to the delegation of powers. As I indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, the Australian Democrats are concerned that the bill as it stands would enable the relevant departments to delegate powers to any public servant or employee and that these powers could include the power to summon witnesses, receive evidence on oath orally or otherwise, require the production of documents or articles, and award costs against the party to proceedings before the office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this is far too wide a delegation of powers to be allowed without any opportunity for parliamentary scrutiny. The amendments are therefore designed to ensure that before that delegation occurs, the officer or class of officers are prescribed by way of regulation.

It does not exclude the department, if it so wishes, naming a particular person or position. But it is quite clear from the phrase `a prescribed class of persons' that this will extend to a whole level of positions that can be described in the regulation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Evidence Bill has three purposes, as indicated by the minister in his second reading speech. Firstly, it is to provide new procedures for enabling authenticated foreign testimony to be admissible subject to certain safeguards; secondly, it is to implement The Hague Convention abolishing the requirement of legalisation for foreign public documents; and, finally, it is to re-enact, with minor changes, certain parts of the Evidence Act 1905.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most significant aspect of this bill is that it is an attempt to simplify the means by which foreign evidence can be introduced into criminal and some civil proceedings in Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction. As I said, it also re-enacts, with some variations, the provisions of the Evidence Act dealing with the examination of witnesses abroad and the taking of evidence in foreign courts. As I have indicated, it also deals with the requirements of the international convention dealing with the authentication of foreign public documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is designed to stand on its own, but it is being introduced by the government as part of a package of quite extensive reform of federal and, potentially, state evidence, if the states want to have uniformity. The Evidence Bill 1993 was introduced into the House of Representatives in December last year and, as I understand it, is due for a second reading debate next month. That bill basically rewrites the law of evidence at the federal level. The government is hoping that the states will follow suit and introduce complementary legislation with the ultimate aim of achieving broadly similar evidence laws in all Australian jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the merits or otherwise of the Foreign Evidence Bill can be considered in isolation from the Evidence Bill, the relationship between the two bills does give rise to some technical issues concerning the application of other laws, which I will come to later. The bill is not opposed by the coalition because, broadly, the objects sought to be achieved by the bill are worth while. But there are some questions concerning the particular method by which the aims and objectives are to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2 of the bill re-enacts, with variations, part IIIB of the Evidence Act 1905. It sets out procedures for examination of witnesses outside Australia, pursuant to court order, after the commencement of proceedings in Australia. It applies to criminal and civil proceedings in Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction. Given that, as I understand it, it essentially re-enacts existing law, it is uncontroversial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of the bill deals with foreign material being admissible in Australian courts without foreign witnesses having to give oral testimony in Australia. At the moment, there are very few situations where that can happen. As a consequence of a resolution of the National Complex White Collar Crime Conference in June 1992 and a resolution from that conference calling for action to reduce the need for foreign witnesses to be made available, this part 3 has been introduced. It is designed to improve the effectiveness of mutual assistance in criminal matters and to assist, therefore, in the prosecution of complex matters that involve  foreign evidence. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I recall, that conference was organised by the National Crime Authority. I ask the minister whether that is right and whether Justice Phillips organised that conference. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7E4">Senator VANSTONE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He deserves to be given a mention today for the very sensible work that he did. Instigating this conference was a very sensible move, and it should be remembered that it was Justice Phillips who got that under way. Perhaps we would not have these changes today if we had not had that conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This part applies to criminal proceedings in Australian courts dealing with an offence against the laws of the Commonwealth. It applies to civil proceedings, but only those that are related to criminal proceedings&mdash;that is, one that arises from the same subject matter from which the criminal proceedings arose. A mechanism is provided for the provisions to apply to state courts dealing with state laws, if the state wants that to happen. That is part of the government's hope of achieving uniformity. No doubt the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs with its costs of justice inquiry will be pleased to see the passage of this legislation. That committee has noted time and time again the increased cost of justice that is occasioned by the lack of uniformity in a wide variety of laws around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A request for foreign testimony and accompanying exhibits has to be made by the Attorney-General. I assume that when a particular agency is looking for some material it has to notify the Attorney-General to make the particular request. The testimony needs to be certified by the foreign country. Once the material is before a court, the court must not allow the material to be adduced if the person who gave the testimony is in Australia and is able to attend the hearing, or if the evidence would otherwise have been inadmissible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The court does have some discretion to exclude material. Specific matters are listed which the court has to take into account in exercising its discretion. One might ask `Why, under part 3, are the procedures limited to proceedings which involve, or have a relationship with, criminal proceedings, and why are the provisions designed for the benefit of law enforcement agencies only, rather than the accused or the defendant?'. Part 3 adds to the provisions of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. That act provides a legislative basis for Australia to enter into arrangements with other countries, whereby it can request and grant assistance in criminal matters. It seems that the practical opportunity for law enforcement agencies to be provided with foreign testimony derives from the relationship that has developed with a number of other countries since the passage of that act and associated bilateral treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 4 of the bill contains a scheme similar to part 3 and allows the Australian Securities Commission to obtain testimony from its foreign equivalents in civil proceedings. The ASC has to be a party to those proceedings. The request can be made direct from the ASC to the foreign securities agency. Once the testimony is provided, the court's discretion to admit or decline to admit the material operates in the same way as the discretions under part 3. The Attorney-General's Department has indicated that the use of this part is intended to be limited to foreign agencies that have formal memoranda of understanding with the ASC. Currently, as I understand it, those memoranda exist with the relevant authorities in the United Kingdom, the United States of America and Hong Kong. If that list is incorrect, the minister might take the opportunity to let us know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Corporations Law the ASC has power to intervene in a variety of proceedings commenced between private parties. It is presumed that intervention of that nature would make the ASC a party to the proceedings for the purpose of part 4. To some extent, it seems incongruous that in those cases the ability to adduce testimony from foreign agencies should depend on whether the ASC has intervened. One should consider that the arrangement will apply, in practical terms, only with the countries referred to previously with whom the formal memoranda of understanding have been agreed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> A significant point not readily apparent from reading the bill is the relationship of parts 2, 3 and 4 to state evidence laws. The difficulty will not be solved by the passage of the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 because while parts 2, 3 and 4 of this bill apply to Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction, the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993 applies to federal courts only. In a situation where a state court is exercising federal jurisdiction, the issue will arise where state laws dealing with foreign evidence and its reception by courts are excluded. Clause 18 of the bill seeks to preserve other laws for the purpose of part 2. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Part is not intended to exclude or limit the operation of any Australian law, or of any rule or regulation made under such a law, that provides for the examination of witnesses outside Australia for the purpose of a proceeding in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It might be determined that part 2 is so comprehensive in its terms that it covers the field in any event, thereby excluding other laws. Formulations seemingly protecting the application of other laws are provided for in parts 3 and 4. The wording in both cases is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Part does not limit the ways in which a matter may be proved, or evidence may be adduced, under this Act (other than this Part) or any other Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA>The words `other than this part' are uncertain in scope. They might arguably exclude, in relation to part 3, for example, any state law that determines the admissibility of foreign testimony in criminal and related civil proceedings. Further, a `covering the field' argument might still be available in relation to parts 3 and 4. If state laws are excluded, it may eliminate laws which operate to admit foreign evidence more expediently than is provided for in this bill. For example, some state laws dealing with the admissibility of business records provide a useful means for the admission of certain categories of foreign evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 5 deals with a recognition by Australian courts and public officials of certain foreign public documents. The Hague convention abolishing the requirement for legalisation of foreign public documents seeks to simplify the procedures for certification of public documents generated in one country and which are required for official use in another country. At present, certain public documents are required to be certified by the foreign embassy or consulate of the country where the document is required. The convention abolishes that practice, and provides for the issue of a certificate by the country which generated the document which is sufficient to authenticate the original document. The government has indicated it wishes to accede to the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill implements the convention by requiring that Australian courts and officials recognise the certificate as evidence of authenticity of the document. It should be noted that court recognition is not limited to Australian courts exercising federal jurisdiction, but is applicable to courts exercising state jurisdiction. It would appear that that extension to state jurisdiction derives from the external affairs power of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department has advised that as a matter of practice foreign documents do not generally require formal legalisation in Australia. The convention is being acceded to, and these provisions implemented, so that the benefit of the convention can be claimed by those seeking to adduce Australian documents in other countries which are party to the convention. There does not seem to be much which is controversial in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 6 re-enacts, with some variations, part IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905. The part deals with a situation where Australian courts are taking evidence for use in foreign proceedings. The part provides that the Attorney-General may prohibit the taking of evidence in the interests of Australia's security. Unlike the Evidence Act 1905, the Attorney's power is not limited to civil and criminal proceedings. It is not entirely clear why that restriction existed in the Evidence Act 1905. However, there appears no justification for the distinction to remain on policy grounds. As I indicated earlier, the coalition does not oppose the bill.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate is debating the Foreign Evidence Bill 1993. This bill has three main purposes: first, to enable authenticated foreign testimony to be admissible in Australian courts; secondly, to implement The Hague convention which abolishes the requirement of diplomatic or consular legislation for foreign public documents; and, thirdly, to re-enact parts IIIB and IIIC of the Evidence Act 1905, the remainder of which is being repealed by the Foreign Evidence (Transitional Provisions and Consequential Amendments) Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central features of the bill address the need in our courts to be cost effective yet, in terms of legal rights, to have a protective mechanism to receive evidence taken in courts overseas. The most important aspect of this legislation and its potential impact on legal rights is contained in part III. In criminal and related proceedings, it will enable foreign testimony and exhibits which are authenticated in the prescribed manner to be admissible in evidence. This limits a party's right to cross-examine potential witnesses. A number of qualifications have been introduced to safeguard people's rights in the operation of this legislative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the evidence must have been taken on oath or under the caution that usually applies in the country where the evidence is taken. Secondly, the evidence must be certified by the court and must bear the seal of a minister of state in that country. Thirdly, the evidence must have been requested by the Attorney-General and certified by the Attorney-General. Fourthly, it is inadmissible if the person is in Australia and is able to attend. Fifthly, it is still subject to tests of admissibility. Sixthly, the Australian court in which the evidence is to be tendered has a discretion to reject the tender of the material if in the interests of justice it should be excluded.This discretion is fairly open-ended under subsection (2) of section 25. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats place a great deal of reliance on this discretion of the court, and it is one of the reasons why we will be supporting this bill. Part IV of the bill which deals with proceedings instituted by the ASC has similar safeguards built in, except that the request must be made by the chairman of the ASC rather than the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's second reading speech claims the virtue of the bill will be that it will save time and money in complex cases where a great deal of foreign evidence is required. This is admitted, although I would like to return to this point a little later. Certainly the safeguards in sections 25 and 33 appear to be adequate to protect defendants' rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should, however, be noted that part II of the bill allows for the examination of overseas witnesses by the court or parties to proceedings or by a foreign tribunal appointed by the court in Australia. The evidence so taken can be admissible in committal hearings and, if the court so directs, be tenderable in the criminal hearing that arises from the committal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, for example, a person whose evidence was taken under the mechanisms available under part II of the bill is still overseas at the time of the trial or has died, then it may still be admissible under relevant state and territory legislation and under this bill without some of the safeguards I have referred to that are available under part III. Given, however, that there is this residual discretion vested in the court to exclude the evidence if justice demands, then this shortfall in safeguards in our view is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have canvassed the views of the profession and the relevant bodies on this and have not been able to ascertain any serious concerns expressed by the legal profession. The genesis of the legislation seems to have been in the general trend for more international cooperation in matters of criminal law. The National Conference on Complex White Collar Crime held in June 1992 referred a number of resolutions to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and the National Crime Authority consultative committee on issues concerning the prosecution of white collar crime. Included in the resolutions was a call for legislation such as is found in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to acknowledge the very valuable work Mr Justice Phillips has carried out in his all too brief sojourn in the capacity of Chairman of the NCA, which took him into a twilight zone between the judicial system and the political system. This was certainly one of the very worthwhile contributions that he has made in what I think is a fairly complex situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also noted by Mr Michael Rozenes, the Director of Public Prosecutions, at that conference that the obvious answer to the problem of obtaining and presenting overseas evidence is to use modern technology and to allow overseas witnesses to give their evidence directly by way of, for example, a satellite link. It would seem to me that this would allow for cross-examination in all cases. It is surely a preferred option to what is being offered in this bill, which I would call a poor man's vision of what is achievable in this area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With regard to the first question, I am advised the answer is that the bill spells out the need for a request by the Attorney-General as a precedent to the operation of part 3. Such requests are made by the Attorney-General pursuant to the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act. Under that act requests can only be made in relation to criminal proceedings, or civil proceedings relating to criminal proceedings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised to give Senator Ellison as much information as I possibly can. I hope it is all relevant to his interests. It is possible for part 3 to be used by defendants. However, it is a condition that the relevant material be obtained pursuant to a request made by or on behalf of the Attorney-General. The Attorney-General may make such requests for private persons under the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 1987. That act does not specifically prevent defendants making applications to a foreign country for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the specific sections which empower a request to be made all refer to such requests being made by the Attorney-General. In a recent case, an Australian court directed that a specific request be made by the Attorney-General to a particular country on behalf of the defendant in the matter before the court. The act does not specifically exclude assistance being sought from foreign countries on behalf of defendants. It is considered that this route, whereby requests on behalf of defendants are limited to those sanctioned by the court and which the court then directs be made by the Attorney-General on behalf of the defendant, is a practical method of preventing overload and possible abuse of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various countries with which we have negotiated mutual assistance treaties have indicated they consider that such assistance should exclude requests made by private persons. It is particularly important that we consider the sensitivities of other countries, especially if those countries already receive a large number of mutual assistance requests. If a request can be made directly by defence lawyers, it is possible that the number of such requests could, with time, dramatically increase and endanger the goodwill established with those countries. I trust that Senator Ellison derived some useful information from that. If he has any further questions, no doubt he will put them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am obliged to the minister. The information certainly was helpful. As I now understand the position&mdash;correct me if I am wrong&mdash;to employ this provision, defendants who want to have a witness examined overseas require a court order. That is, they need to make application to the court. The court then makes an order which goes to the Attorney-General, who in turn makes a request. The prosecution can employ that procedure. But added to that, the prosecution can go directly to the Attorney-General to make the request. So the prosecution has two avenues available, whereas the defence has only one.

The defence should not be prejudiced in any way by having to make this application at such a late stage.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether the exclusion of the foreign material would cause undue expense or delay.</PARA>
<PARA>That is something which really would apply to the prosecution, I suppose.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probative is something that the prosecutor would normally look to if he were trying to prove something. I wonder whether the defence should not get a mention there. One of the things we have to address our mind to is: if we exclude this, will it prejudice the defence? That could then heighten the way in which the court has to address any application at the court door by the defence for a witness to be examined overseas. I suppose a judge has discretion anyway in respect of late notice being given or an adjournment being asked for because something has happened at the last minute.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps the matter could be covered by adding `(e) whether the exclusion of the foreign material would cause prejudice to either party'. That clearly would cover the prosecution because one does not want to prejudice the prosecution either. The minister says `other matters'. If one argues before a judge that other matters are allowed to be taken into account, the judge will say, `Yes, but I have got these four criteria which parliament has spelt out that it specifically wants me to take into account'. These other peripheral matters do not enjoy the same status as the four that are enumerated here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prejudice in the exclusion of evidence has always been a key criterion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The prosecution might have something to say, too, on prejudice. Prejudice does not come under `undue expense or delay' in subclause (d). The extent to which the material could be challenged under (c) touches on it. The probative value in (b) is perhaps not so relevant to the question of prejudice as to the worth of the evidence. The words `the extent to which the foreign material provides evidence that would not otherwise be available' in (a) skirt around it. I simply put it to the minister that the words `substantial prejudice' might indicate to the court that it has to be something of great moment before there has to be an order. In other words, it has to be absolutely crucial to the defence before the court will make an order in its favour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are looking at here is a question of degree. In the defendant's eyes, something which is important is just as crucial as something which is essential because it is the straw on the camel's back. How many straws do we have to put on the back before we break it? That is the problem I have with the word `substantial'. The word `prejudice' is perhaps sufficient because if something is prejudicial, it is prejudicial. It is like being pregnant&mdash;you cannot be half pregnant. If it is prejudicial, then it is undesirable, and it is undesirable that it be prejudicial to both the prosecution and the defence because justice requires that prejudice have no place. I inquire as to the government's thoughts on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problem is that the prosecution has this unfettered aspect of its request because the Attorney-General could simply make the request. The prosecution makes frequent requests. That uses up all the brownie points, so to speak, of the foreign countries. Defence lawyers come along&mdash;or the defendants themselves; we cannot exclude the fact that people appear in person&mdash;and say that there is a person, as was the case that I dealt with in Miami, who is not willing to come to Australia. I needed an order for that person to have his testimony taken and for it to be available to be adduced in the hearing. In the hearing I was involved in, there was no way of getting that testimony at the time. It is indicative of the problem that we face. The Attorney-General can do it willy-nilly for the prosecution, but a bar is being placed in the way of the defendant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can appreciate what the minister is saying in keeping good relations with other states. We do not want to overstay the welcome, so to speak. But the problem we have is that there must be some balance between the way the courts administer this. The court says that it is okay for the prosecution to have unfettered use of this, but when it comes to the defence, it really has to have a big point before it is used. I appreciate that we would not use it for minor matters or for matters of no great moment because that would be an abuse of the system. It could be employed to obtain all sorts of adjournments and it could be a ploy by the defence. I appreciate that. But if it is to be prejudicial, if anything is considered to be prejudicial by the court, then it becomes very serious. </PARA>

That is really what the minister is asking the court to do. The result could be for the court to say, `We find that to exclude this evidence would be prejudicial, but we do not think it would be substantially prejudicial'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1993 makes some small changes to the higher education legislation which the opposition does not oppose. They are well argued for in various documents, not least the December report about higher education funding in the 1994-96 triennium circulated by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. However, we do see some serious flaws in this legislation. I will, as succinctly as I can, on behalf of the opposition, refer to these, and move a second reading amendment highlighting one flaw in particular which we regard as unsatisfactory; that is, the fact that there are no new places in this legislation for Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. The opposition regards this as being insufficiently explained by the government. The appearance is that the Commonwealth government is directly excluding from growth those three states, which include the state that I represent, and the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal first with the higher education contribution scheme. This legislation will correct some anomalies and reinforce the administrative handling of tax file numbers within the higher education contribution scheme system. The opposition sees no objection to the proposals in this legislation for making these adjustments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth recalling, though, that only last December when we were last sitting, the opposition very significantly and successfully opposed two of the government's proposals on the higher education contribution scheme. One proposal was that a double rate of HECS liability be accrued to some students. That is no longer to be the case. The other proposal was that a 1 1/2 times rate of HECS be accrued to those who were not making, as the government put it, sufficient progress. This has also been abandoned. These serious modifications to HECS would have been to the detriment of Australia's students and the whole of our education system. The opposition is glad that the Senate blocked those two government proposals. But, in this case, we support the government's changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I refer to is open learning. I am sure it is a disappointment to senators from all sides that there has not been the level of enrolments in open learning that was envisaged both 12 months ago when this open learning initiative first operated, and six months ago when estimates were made with regard to the 1994 year. So it is disappointing that, as a direct result of lower enrolments, we have to see in this legislation an adjustment of the moneys to be passed to the open learning initiative. Nevertheless, I am glad to see that for the triennium we have the same overall commitment of moneys for this area. I do hope that marketing, promoting the credibility of the scheme and other initiatives will lead to increased enrolment in open learning in the coming months. It is a great opportunity for many&mdash;not least, mature age students and those in areas distant from our capital cities&mdash;to take on higher education studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area I wish to deal with is the extra $51.7 million to be spent over three years to enable Australia's universities to meet their superannuation guarantee levy obligations. Of course we would not deny the universities this money, but I take the chance to remind the Senate that free enterprise&mdash;which employs the great bulk of Australians&mdash;cannot dip into taxpayers' money for $51.7 million in the way that our universities can. It is the opposition's view that the government has not responsibly taken account of the additional cost to employers in the private sector of the superannuation guarantee levy and that this levy will have a detrimental effect on the numbers of employed Australians. But for the public sector, seeking this additional money is a natural outcome of the law of the land as it now stands.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area I wish to mention is the area in which we have some difficulties with the government's position: the provision of new places within all of our universities. Reference is made to this in a number of points in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Higher education funding for the 1994-96 triennium</EMPHASIS> as distributed by the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley. This is quite a detailed and comprehensive report. On page 31, reference is made to principles underlying the allocation of 1996 growth. Subsequent sections that relate to the operating grants of the universities talk about the redefinition of targets and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These pages do not adequately explain the government's intentions to have new places in only a few states and no new places at all in Victoria, no new places at all in South Australia, no new places at all in Tasmania and no new places at all in the Northern Territory. A number of my colleagues immediately twitched their political noses and asked, `Is the Labor government in Canberra singling out a number of states where there are Liberal governments and, on political grounds, denying them growth in 1996?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties are not satisfied with the explanation that the government has given, although there was a sort of wave of the hand in the other place when the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, appealed in his second reading speech for equity and talked about population growth trends, the lower take-up of enrolments as a percentage of population and so on. But this has not been made clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I speak very plainly as a senator for South Australia: why should South Australia in 1996 get zero growth in university places? No doubt the Commonwealth, government ministers and party colleagues will try to pin this situation on those states themselves and mislead the public into thinking that these outcomes are a result of Liberal governments rather than a decision of this Labor Government here in Canberra. Accordingly, on behalf of the opposition I move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of motion, add "but the Senate:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Demand for university places in Victoria is rising contrary to the downward national trend according to the Victorian Minister for Tertiary Education and Training, Haddon Storey.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Storey's comments follow reports of national trend figures that inaccurately suggest demand for university places is down in all states. The number of applications in Victoria rose this year from 66,207 to 66,782 with a continuing high level of unmet demand for places.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Storey expressed concern that many Victorians would miss out on a university place because of Federal Government funding policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The Federal Government has chosen to ignore community demand and is playing politics with the allocation of university places between states," Mr Storey said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Under the Commonwealth's funding plans for the 1994-6 triennium extra university places will be allocated away from Victoria and in 1996 no new university places will be available to Victoria."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Storey said this meant Commonwealth discrimination against Victoria in university funding policies would continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Since 1989 higher education expansion in Australia had been financed by students through HECS fees with approximately 28% from Victorian students, yet only 20% of these monies returned to Victoria as extra university places," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In effect, Victorian students will continue to subsidise extra places in other states despite the fact that Victoria's level of unmet demand is higher than any other state," Mr Storey said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Simon Crean says he sees nothing wrong with shifting resources from Victoria even though Victoria cross subsidises other states by around $800 million per year."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"What he does not say is that demand for university places in Victoria is climbing against the national trend, with unmet demand continuing despite the provision of an additional 4,500 places over 1993 and 1994 funded by the Victoria Government," he said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Storey said Victoria was not only being penalised for successfully encouraging young people to continue their education it was being `equalised', or socially engineered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Victoria is Australia's research capital and the home of a large number of its knowledge industries," Mr Storey said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Given that Victoria also has the highest workforce proportion in professional occupations, the state requires a continuing high level of participation in university studies and employer and student demand reflects this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"These facts have been ignored by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Mr Crean is saying that he sees nothing wrong with the redirection of places away from Victoria in the face of this demand. The Victorian Government rejects his proposals as a blatant form of social engineering," he said.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has chosen to ignore community demand and is playing politics with the allocation of university places between states.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that he appeals directly to the minister. Of course, Mr Crean, the newly appointed Minister for Employment, Education and Training, is a Victorian. It is very sad that the first legislation he handles in the parliament in this area is denying his own state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to Mr Crean, not just in the terms of Mr Storey's justified statements with regard to Victoria. I also make an appeal to Mr Crean and the government in regard to what I call the centralising years of the Labor government under Mr Dawkins, which unfortunately continued under the minister following him, Mr Beazley. I appeal to Mr Crean to break free of that centralising objective of those preceding ministers that has brought the Labor Party and this Commonwealth government into such disrepute in our higher education institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to Mr Crean to allow decisions to be decentralised and to allow some degree of autonomy to be regained by our university councils. We have had too many years of centralisation. All wisdom does not reside with the minister in Canberra, nor does it reside solely with his advisers from the Department of Employment, Education and Training. There is a great deal of experience at the level of a university council or a vice-chancellor's department, and there is room for initiative. Throughout all these years, the policy of the Liberal and National parties to decentralise and return autonomy to universities has stood in contrast to government policy. We trust those people who have, because of their experience, attained positions of leadership within our universities. I appeal to minister Crean to take notice of our better approach and to draw a distinction between his way of handling higher education matters and that of his predecessors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another bias in the criteria set out from page 31 onwards in the government's statement and it works against mature age students to the advantage of school leavers. School leavers are defined as those who apply to come to a university within two years of completing year 12&mdash;a totally acceptable definition. However, the government feels that an insufficient number of places have been set aside for school leavers, despite the fact that they get the great bulk of university allocations, particularly for first year places. Therefore, this centralising minister of this centralising government has told the universities that a quota will apply to mature age students and that the system must be adjusted to favour school leavers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no brief other than to open up the doors to all those who want to come into our universities&mdash;be they school leavers or mature age students. In 90 per cent of cases, mature age students are coming to our universities for the first time. For the bulk of them it is their first chance, at age 25, 30 or 40, to enrol at a university. Senator Bell and other senators in the chamber will know that often they are the most successful undergraduates and go on to achieve honours, masters and other postgraduate degrees. They are very successful students because they are well motivated and come with a great deal more experience than some school leavers.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the call for a quorum, I was appealing to Victorian, Tasmanian, South Australian and Northern  Territory senators to note that this government has made no provision for growth in their states and territories in the 1996 year. I believe that those government senators who have now joined the debate ought to take up that matter in both caucus and in the other decision making processes of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a fair and genuinely equitable place in the sun for both mature age students and school leavers entering our universities. The best way to ensure this is to allow institutions to open their doors to whomever they wish on whatever basis they wish&mdash;the policy of the Liberal-National party coalition. The only criticism this policy has generated is the thin edge of the wedge argument. The argument is that in subsequent years, if we allow universities to charge fees for school leavers and mature age students in addition to the places provided by the Commonwealth, that wedge might become wider and wider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition gives an undertaking that in government it will always guarantee an assured, predictable number of Commonwealth provided places in our universities and that institutions will be given the freedom to open their doors on whatever basis they think fit. At the moment this Labor Government prevents all our universities taking such a course. Such an undertaking as that suggested by the coalition would particularly help mature age and part-time students, which is the group the government is picking on in its high-minded appeal for more places for school leavers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development.

Is the minister aware that the New South Wales Labor leader, Bob Carr, has called for a joint federal-state government rescue package for the New South Wales plant? Is the federal government considering such a rescue package? Does the minister see Ford's decision as a sign of confidence in Australia's economic recovery? What impact will the decisions have on our elaborately transformed manufacturing exports and imports?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the statement by the New South Wales Labor leader, Bob Carr, as Senator Short has reported it; but doubtless I will. I will be delighted to discuss his proposal with him when it is put before me. The announcement by Ford Australia today is unfortunate for the approximately 400 employees of Ford at Homebush who face unemployment when the Laser production facility at Homebush closes in September this year. But I note that Ford has pledged in public comments to work with the unions and employees to find alternative employment. I can say that we will, under the motor vehicle labour adjustment program, assist in that process too.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short asked me whether this announcement by Ford is an indication of confidence in the recovery. It is not a commentary on the state of the economy; it is a commentary more on the state of the motor vehicle market in Australia and the export potential and export gains of motor vehicle manufacturers in Australia. The figures on the recovery given by the Treasurer last week and provided to the Senate by me in answer to a question last week about further economic growth, continuing low inflation, further growth in employment, and so on&mdash;all the positive indicators&mdash;remain true. That is the scenario we are looking at in terms of recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ford's Laser is assembled at Homebush from packs imported from overseas in knocked-down condition. The Australian content is estimated at about 50 per cent. One of the problems for Ford is that it has not been able to hold market share, although market share of other small cars in Australia, notably the Corolla, is about the same as it was right back to 1990&mdash;give or take a few percentage points&mdash;when the two were locked in fierce competition. So it really is a commentary on the competitive nature of the domestic car market.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The Corolla, which has held its market share the most, is fully manufactured in Australia. It is not assembled from knocked-down kits imported from overseas. The story of the Australian car industry, which remains a ringing endorsement of the industry&mdash;the levels of productivity, the improvement in quality and the reduction in manufacturing costs it has been able to achieve&mdash;is to be seen in the export market, where exports last year increased by 20 per cent to now register $1.5 billion. This is an adjustment in the market due to commercial factors and is not a commentary on the overall state of the economy. It can be said that the commitment of Ford to concentrate now on core production suggests that that company's future in this country is assured.</PARA></TALK.START>

The company had made a decision to remove from its operations its loss making elements, and this has created an after tax profit of $44 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company has planned to discontinue manufacture of the Capri in Victoria and to close its Homebush plant in Sydney, New South Wales. The Capri production will cease in May. Sales in the US of that motor vehicle have fallen below the viable threshold that the company has set, and workers on the Capri production line will continue in work, as will that plant, on Falcon production. The Laser, which is assembled, as I have said, from knocked-down kits and imported into Australia, is, in the company's view, no longer economically viable. Production of the Laser will end in September of this year when a new generation Laser will be fully imported from Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company has also said that approximately 400 workers will be out of work as a result of closure of the Homebush plant and that it is not anticipating any unemployment in Victoria as a consequence of the company's decision there. Ford has committed itself to work with the unions and the employees to help find work, provide retraining and provide outplacement services. Ford, as the passenger motor vehicle market leader with the Falcon, is committed to continuing its core business of Falcon, Fairmont, LTD and Falcon commercial productions in Australia, and it has expressed a desire to continue to lead in the domestic market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government reaction to this statement is, as I said in answer to an earlier question, that it is unfortunate and regrettable for the workers concerned that this decision has been made. The government's motor vehicle plan labour adjustment package, which offers a range of services and assistance, will now be made available in the form of wage subsidies, vocational training of up to 12 months and relocation assistance, and the government will talk to Ford and the unions about helping those redundant workers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also particularly difficult in these circumstances that news of this redundancy was leaked in advance, meaning that some workers woke up this morning and read it for the first time in their newspapers. That prevented Ford from being able to break the news itself, as it wanted to initially, to its own employees. Therefore, it is deplorable that whoever leaked that has created such trauma and difficulty for the human relations necessary to deal with an adjustment such as this smoothly.</PARA>

I ask the minister: is he concerned that the proportion of imported motor vehicles sold in Australia has risen to almost 50 per cent in 1993-94, compared with approximately 33 per cent only five years ago, with a loss in employment of 24 per cent? What steps, if any, is he prepared to take to reverse this trend, and, in particular, would he consider any additional measures to encourage research and product development by the car industry and by industry generally?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take each of those points in reverse order and commence with research and development. I met on Friday morning with the automotive industries of Australia. They put to me some ideas about research and development and product development, which I have before me. I am actively considering them and they will go into any industry statement that I make. On the question of what steps, if any, I am prepared to take in addition to the existing arrangements for the car industry plan, Senator Spindler is probing me about what I might do in the statement. I think the fundamentals of the car industry plan have worked appropriately and well, and I would not want to disturb them. But one always looks at plans such as this to see how better they might be targeted to achieve their goals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first point, Senator Spindler has quoted some statistics. They are not relevant in the case of this closure, and I give him statistics of my own. In 1990, the Corolla, which is wholly made in Australia, had 26.7 per cent of the market share. The Laser, which is constructed out of knocked-down packs, had 28 per cent of the market share. Last year the Corolla had 24.2 per cent of the market share, a decline of 2.5 per cent it is admitted. The Laser had 16.6 per cent of the market share, a decline of 11.4 per cent. It is because of that market decline, I think it is fair to say, that the company now finds its production in this form uneconomic and has taken the steps it has.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what Senator Spindler has neglected to do in the statistics he has quoted to me is refer also to the export performance of this industry. If one takes the export performance of this industry from its inception in 1984 until 1993, one sees that there has been a 225 per cent increase in exports of motor vehicles and car parts from Australia. As I have said, last year there was a 20 per cent increase. It is true that employment has reduced significantly in this industry, but this industry is globally competitive. It has paid a great deal of attention to embracing new technology to put itself at the leading edge of technology and development. It has paid a lot of attention to increasing productivity per head and improving the quality of its product as well, so that Australian produced motor vehicles or car parts are at world quality and productivity levels, and thus competitive. It has largely succeeded in doing that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be said about major factory-based production line industry in the world&mdash;not just Australia&mdash;is that there is always a shrinkage of labour with the introduction of new technology.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I think the minister should consider that, while our exports have risen, they have risen from a very small base. I think the job losses, despite productivity increases, indicate that we are still not in balance. I wonder whether in his consideration of the industry statement the minister would like to consider that five or six nations in the region have car tariffs ranging from 55 per cent to 300 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that it has risen from a small base, but it is now valued at $1.5 billion, which is not insignificant in terms of export earnings for Australia and is a reason why the car plan is turning a positive result. It is one of the reasons that Mitsubishi, Toyota and Holden have made the commitments they have and why I expect Ford will do the same. When we look at the industry statement, and I hope to do this in consort with my colleague Senator McMullan, we will look at the market and questions of market impediment or market obstruction. But we have just completed the GATT round which resulted in across-the-board reductions in tariff protection. There may be a case for looking at some bilateral strategies to deal with that issue. In the broad compass of the industry statement we will methodically, systematically and, I expect, intelligently deal with those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>

That exhibition is to be opened by the Prime Minister later this evening. There is a quite simple reason why the Australian War Memorial should stage such an exhibition. I think it does bring into sharp focus the devastating effects of the war in Europe and symbolises the tyranny which Australians fought against during that war. It also acknowledges the strength of the human spirit of those who were affected by the atrocities during the war.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the children had the assistance and support of a professional art teacher, they were encouraged to draw in order to keep their spirits up, rather than to produce quality, finished artworks. The quality of the drawings is, as a result, quite variable, but I think that the extraordinary level of passion and emotion is clearly evident in those drawings even after 50 years has elapsed. The children's drawings depict representation of their lives under the Nazis, reflections of their lives before the war, and the fantasy worlds to which they all escaped. Nearly all the children were subsequently murdered in Auschwitz.</PARA>

<PARA>Senator Faulkner placed great stress on the point that it would be unreasonable for me, or any other senator, to expect him to know how many pensions had been withheld because of a failure to provide a tax file number. I challenge that assertion because it is quite a reasonable question to ask of any minister. What we are talking about here are two pensions: the service pension, which is paid, as an income support measure and is means tested, to veterans who have served in Australia's defence forces; and a disability pension, which is compensation for the rigours of war and the effect it has had on their lifestyles.

The report makes various extremely important findings. For example, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inward looking nature and insularity of the Customs organisation is a matter of serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA>The report calls for the abolition of the Australian Customs Service and the positions of the comptroller-general, his deputies, collectors and all the other senior executive officers. It calls for major rationalisation, large management savings and staff cuts. These are not minor matters by any means. Indeed, they go right to the heart and core of administration. My colleagues Senator Ferguson and Senator Bishop will be elaborating on some of these aspects in their comments during this unfortunately truncated debate. More specifically, the report summarises its views as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Criticism was consistent and wide ranging, from internal policies and practices, such as mobility and training of staff, to claims of intimidation and inconsistency in dealing with companies. There were allegations of inefficiency, secrecy, lack of commercial judgement, poor communication, inflexibility, confusion of purpose, lack of specialist skills, ineffectual leadership and lack of accountability for actions.</PARA>
<PARA>Damningly, the committee formed the view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Customs have lost direction and management are generally unresponsive to industry requirements, adopting defensive attitudes, preferring not to make critical decisions and establishing mechanisms to avoid those decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are very serious matters indeed, coming on top of the scandalous requirement for the $25 million payout over the Midford Paramount debacle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no reason at all for the minister not to be aware of the problems within the Customs Service, and no excuse for his or his predecessors' failure to act in this regard. Since 1970 there have been no fewer than 20 reports into the Australian Customs Service. There have been three reports since 1990, and major reports into its operations in 1983, 1987, 1990, 1991 and 1992. The 1987 report was that of a task force set up specifically to examine alleged shortcomings in customs legislation and practice. This latest review has found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are clear instances that can be traced back as far as the Mahoney report in 1983 where recommendations accepted by Customs either clearly have not been implemented or where strong doubts exist on sustained implementation action.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the reports of the last 20 years or so, there have been some 150 specific recommendations for change and improvement in the Customs Service. Very few, if any, of those have been acted on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the question, to which I hope the minister will respond: why has not the succession of Labor ministers with responsibility for the Customs Service ever done anything about this at all? The matter that concerns me most of all is the question of ministerial responsibility and accountability, because under this government the convention of ministerial responsibility has gone right out the window. It is almost as if the government has never heard of that convention. It does not give a damn about public administration; rather, it practises maladministration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government rorts the political system, as we have seen in recent weeks par excellence with minister Kelly, who has not got the decency, or any concept of accountability, to resign. We have seen the problem with Minister Griffiths, who has resigned. We saw the problem in earlier years with Mick Young. In fact, he had to resign three times. We saw the misleading of the parliament by John Brown, who also had to resign. In all of those cases, those resignations were dragged out of the ministers of the day, who went down screaming, without any willingness to accept their ministerial responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our parliamentary system and traditions, responsibility for the administration of a minister's department rests fairly and squarely with the minister&mdash;in this case, of course, the subject of today's debate, Senator Schacht. It is alarming in the extreme to find the inadequate, half-hearted response that the minister has given. All Senator Schacht has done is give the report to DITARD to investigate. He obviously had no alternative but to ask Mr Frank Kelly to resign&mdash;and Mr Kelly had no option, either. I will not go into that at the moment, other than to say it is quite extraordinary that a person who presided in the administrative sense over the activities which were the subject of such brutal criticism by this review committee should have now been appointed as a very senior departmental adviser earning no less than $126,000 a year. That can only be described as sending absolutely the wrong signal. I ask Senator Schacht whether he can tell me in his response if that appointment is for two years or longer and, if so, for what term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many additional things I would like to say but time prevents that. I conclude my remarks by saying that at the end of the day the buck stops with the minister and with the government. The government has known for many years that things were sadly wrong within the Australian Customs Service, its operations and practices. It is a disgrace that nothing has been done, requiring this review to highlight these matters. Although our urgency motion today does not call for it, if the minister had any sense of his own responsibility he would have no option but to resign. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine what would have happened if I had started moving into Customs by lopping a head here and there&mdash;which is what those opposite would have wanted to do&mdash;and changing structures off my own bat. I would have been criticised in this chamber of taking precipitative action with no considered review. That would have been the criticism. Those opposite would then have been asking me to resign because I had acted impulsively and precipitantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have gone about this in the proper way. A considered report is now before the parliament and before the people of Australia about the future of Customs. It makes it very clear that Customs has to change substantially&mdash;not just in its administration, not just in its application of rules, but also in its culture. It will only change if we get direction from the bottom up as well as from the top down. If we make the thousands of individual Customs employees willing to support the significant cultural change that they and their service have to go through, we will get the sort of long-term reform within the organisation that would prevent a disaster such as Midford happening again. No-one on the government side enjoyed having to make a decision to pay out $25 million in compensation. We could all think of a hundred other areas in which we would rather spend $25 million than compensation. But, since I have been minister, it has been my first and long-term aim to bring about change in Customs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that I support the general thrust of the report before the government. I have not committed myself to any individual recommendation. It would be unwise for me to do so before I get a considered proposal to cabinet because the recommendations have been described in some quarters as unprecedented in any Commonwealth government department. The report talks about a possible 1,400 redundancies out of a total of 4,800 positions. It talks about changing the act to wipe out the statutory offices of the comptroller-general and deputy comptrollers-general. It wipes out the Australian Customs Service. It recommends the creation of an organisation called Customs Australia and the appointment of a chief executive. It recommends the abolition of the present structure, with many individual programs to be reorganised into three separate programs with a chief executive in charge. They represent substantial and significant structural changes, yet those opposite expect me to get the report one day, table it in parliament and immediately announce the changes. If we go that way, we will not get the change at the grassroots level of the system, down among the serving officers. That is the most important change we need to make. We can restructure the pyramid with a flat new management structure or whatever, but unless we get a culture change among the serving officers, problems such as Midford will keep coming up. The culture has to change from within. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the message I want to drive home with this report. From the brief discussions I have already had with senior management and from addressing over 350 middle level and senior staff yesterday at Customs here in Canberra, I think there is an overwhelming predisposition amongst the ordinary staff to adopt the change and get on with the job in a constructive way. Many of those people want the change because they know their service, their department, is being affected in its standing in the community by such disasters as Midford. They want to make the change, and we intend to support them by making it in a cooperative way. Certainly, the opposition can swing the axe and abuse people up hill and down dale, but that does not get culture change&mdash;and culture change is what I am committed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know Senator Short has had no ministerial experience&mdash;it may be a long time before he gets the opportunity&mdash;but the way to go in executive government in relation to this issue is to take the recommendations and get the support of cabinet to make these changes. After a period, when Customs has had the opportunity to comment, I believe Customs will overwhelmingly accept the recommendations. Other departments may also have a view, the union may have a view, and clients of Customs in the community may wish to comment on them. I received information today from various clients of Customs commenting on the report. Most of it is constructive and positive. The proper way to go is to give those people and organisations an opportunity to contribute constructively to this reorganisation of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that most people have got themselves into a lather about is, of course, Mr Kelly. Mr Kelly has resigned as comptroller-general. He is a statutory office-holder, and he will be until Friday when the resignation takes effect. That gives him, because the parliament has given them to him, certain rights regarding his own position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After discussion, Mr Kelly agreed to stand down from that position, but he had every right to stay in the Public Service, which he has.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to condemn the Government for the abject failure under successive responsible Ministers to administer the Australian Customs Service competently,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats support this urgency motion with one proviso. While it is certainly clear that the government deserves censure over its failure on a long range basis to administer this department and control it competently, I believe it is difficult to say that the response of Senator Schacht, the current minister, to this report has been grossly inadequate. I find that his response has been adequate. Not only has he started this inquiry, but also he has undertaken to implement it in broad terms and to assess each detail. I find it difficult to say that his performance is grossly inadequate. </PARA>

<PARA>One really could not have much more than that. This excellent report is now on the table and these deficiencies are clearly itemised. I take this opportunity to pay tribute to the panel: the Chairman, former Westpac chief, Mr Frank Conroy; Mr Ian Macphee, a former Liberal minister; and Ms Susan Ryan, a former Labor minister. I believe this report can stand as a model of investigation and reporting for similar reports, and no doubt&mdash;the minister might agree, somewhat wryly perhaps&mdash;other government departments could do with a report of this nature. The minister has acknowledged the serious deficiencies in management. It is worth noting that the deficiencies include hierarchical structure and no direction, and in many parts of our public administration these are areas that we should address. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than reiterating these facts&mdash;and the report is a weighty one&mdash;and taking up the time of this chamber, I believe the time and energy of this house would be better applied to the commitment to ensure that the responses that the government makes are appropriate, and that the recommendations are carried out to the extent that that is appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA>That is a very important statement. We are not obliged to treat other nations in the way in which they would want; there is no moral obligation to do that when we are protecting our interests.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The complexity of commercial behaviour and systems deny simple explanations and remedies to claims made to the Committee that anti-dumping law should be administered with an approach favouring Australian producers.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told in paragraph 15.45 that it is difficult to deal with that because, occasionally, dumped products assist our industries through their absorption into Australian produced products. I think that argument is irrelevant. So what! Good luck to those industries. If Australian employers and workers are not harmed by dumping but, on the contrary, are assisted, good luck to them. Why worry? Why would that, in any way, affect the obligation of Customs and the minister to ensure that no harm comes to Australian industries? Paragraph 15.46 states:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sometimes that also applies to senators, such as myself, who have tried to get information out of the Customs Service in Senate estimates committees. This has not been an easy task and as a result, as the minister would be well aware, there are now two matters before the privileges committee, which is investigating whether Customs Service officers have misled or failed to provide relevant information to estimates committees. One of these privilege matters relates to Midford Paramount and the other&mdash;the minister is well aware that I have been involved in this matter&mdash;relates to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I only mention these matters because it appears to me that the attitude of the Customs Service&mdash;not only towards the public, but also towards the institution of parliament and its own minister&mdash;is somewhat disrespectful, to say the least. After the Midford Paramount case, the damning report by the Joint Committee on Public Accounts and the referral of the Midford Paramount matter to the privileges committee, I would have thought that the Australian Customs Service had been put on notice well and truly and would be willing to mend its ways. But no, it jumped, boots and all, into the diesel fuel rebate debacle, stranding the minister like a shag on a rock. Perhaps a more appropriate analogy would be that of the Customs Service hanging like an albatross around the minister's neck, although the science community would probably compete for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether the minister knows this, but the talk is that the Customs Service has tried to `mushroom' him&mdash;keep him in the dark.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot begin to speculate why this minister and Customs ministers before him have let the Australian Customs Service run rampant. I do not know if this minister or previous ministers have tried to bring the service into line and failed. I do not know if the Customs Service has managed to convince this minister and previous ministers that it was changing and that it was adopting the recommendations of the previous reports on it. There have been plenty of reports and recommendations, yet this minister had to commission another one. I hope he has read the other reports because there were plenty of recommendations for changes to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eventually the Midford Paramount case became the customs equivalent of the Royal Australian Navy's sexual harassment case on the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Swan</EMPHASIS>.

Anyone who thinks that the sexual harassment was an isolated incident or thinks that a management shake-up in the Customs Service will suffice is walking around in a fantasy world.

It is quite clear that it was obviously annoyed at the special treatment and concessions that Midford Paramount had been given by the Fraser government.

<PARA>That is going to be a very interesting problem for Senator Bishop, and for the Liberal Party, to be able to work out a mechanism by which she can offer her substantive opinions on a substantive policy matter other than the sort of hysterical nonsense that we have seen so far. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say that there is a need for substantial reform&mdash;a need for cultural change. But we do not throw the baby out with the bath water. The Customs Service is of enormous importance to this country. It collects some $15 billion worth of revenue. It has responsibility for the protection of Australian borders. Some 10 million people a year cross those borders. It has responsibility for assistance with a whole range of industry programs. It is an important agency to these people. It has a responsibility for a range of matters, which this government takes very seriously. A ham fisted, bloody-minded approach is no way to deal with this sort of matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Poor old Senator Carr was put into this debate with no substance and no policy initiatives. To quote Senator Gareth Evans's favourite words, `he just did a little fulminating'. This motion is in part that we `condemn the Government for the abject failure under successive responsible Ministers'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sorry that Senator Button is not here for this debate. I am going to remind the chamber what Senator Button had to say when I moved the motion for the reference of this matter to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. It is to the credit of Senator Spindler that I took the matter to him, and the Democrats agreed with me that the reference needed to be made. We had spent some 60 hours in estimates asking questions. Any read of the estimates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will show the quality of answers that Mr Kelly failed to give&mdash;that is the real description. There was a constant failure to be able to come to grips with policy initiatives or seriously answer a question in a way that was even, straightforward and honest. Again and again we came against these problems. So when I took it to the Democrats to discuss the matter, they agreed that it needed to be referred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did Senator Button have to say? He said of me and of the questions I had been asking that I had, `reiterated all sorts of unsubstantiated allegations and it was a tale full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'. That is a bit like Senator Carr's ramblings. He said I had taken $200,000 worth of public servants' time dealing with unsubstantiated allegations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those unsubstantiated allegations turned out to be the federal government using taxpayers money to pay $25 million worth of compensation to people whose lives, reputations and businesses had been destroyed. Does that sound like unsubstantiated allegations? Does that sound like something which did not have any substance? I was not pursuing a policy, Senator Carr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Button went on to say about me, `It is no good coming in here with her student law moot rhetoric, making further unsubstantiated allegations in the course of this matter'. He then went on to move an amendment to the motion to say, `that Senator Bishop not participate in any hearing of the Committee on the . . . matter of this reference'. He was forced to withdraw that after Senator Harradine, Senator Hill and the Democrats spoke in such a way that he felt humiliated, and withdrew. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say through this inquiry that he and the government opposed its taking place at all. We had to postpone the hearings for two years because the DPP came and told us that if we called witnesses, he was going to depend on those same witnesses in another prosecution and he did not want them discredited. We agreed not to hear those witnesses before the case. To my dying day I will regret that, because someone was convicted on the evidence of two of those witnesses who came before our committee and were totally discredited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the executive summary of the Midford report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, we see the following passage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee discovered serious shortcomings, however, in the investigatory work undertaken by the Australian Customs Service in relation to these other matters and concluded that they may well have suffered the same fate as the quota matter if they too had progressed to court proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Midford was not isolated. We went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee recognises,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>this is very important&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">however, that the Comptroller-General cannot be held personally responsible for all of the actions of his individual subordinate officers. Nevertheless, he must accept responsibility for the overall lack of efficiency and effectiveness of the performance of the ACS, the prevailing culture in the Service and the changes that must be made.</PARA>
<PARA>Again and again the Customs Service would say, `We got it right. The courts got it wrong. The hearings got it wrong. Everybody in the world is wrong except the Australian Customs Service.' This is the same attitude that we see in Mr Kelly presumably saying to Senator Schacht, `I will resign but you have got to give me a golden parachute'. Quite clearly, the Conroy committee knew, in this very good and sensible report, the difficulties of getting rid of a statutory officer and therefore it came up with a very sensible recommendation that the Australian Customs Service be abolished, together with all the positions held. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the whole point. The minister has rewarded incompetence. Let us look at what happened to other people where there have been changes. The way it has occurred by way of precedent, where there was a determination to get rid of someone who was incompetent and not worth the taxpayers' money, was to abolish the position; they then seek to reapply and fail. That is the way it is done and he would not be rewarded. The minister has set a precedent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short's motion says there is a need to condemn the government for its abject failure under successive responsible ministers to administer the Australian Customs Service competently as demonstrated in the critical review of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Turning Point</EMPHASIS>. I think it is very important that this review is so entitled. The report arose out of a process initiated by the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) and by the government, and it does make some criticism with respect to previous reports and the lack of implementation of previous reviews.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, Senator Ferguson made the point that from 1970 onwards there have been a number of reports and indeed there have been. It needs to be reiterated that for the majority of that period until 1983 conservative governments held office and did nothing. The minister has said quite clearly that the government will act on the report's recommendations. But there is a process that has to be followed. I do not make out that I have read the report or indeed know all of the problems or all of the solutions, but certainly one sees from the executive summary a process set down where there needs to be some immediate action. I think what the minister has said and what course of action the government will take are totally in line with this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday a member in the other place spoke of me in such a way that I wish to clear myself of any misrepresentation by that member. The member was Mr Clyde Holding, the member for Melbourne Ports. He referred to a function which he and I attended about three weeks ago. It was a function given by the Hellas Soccer Club of South Melbourne, which was one of the recipients of the sports grants given by Mrs Kelly in the recent funding round. Mr Holding said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 89th conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union held in New Delhi, India, between 12 and 17 April 1993. As leader of the delegation of the 89th Inter-Parliamentary Conference held in New Delhi, it is my pleasure to report to the parliament on the principal outcomes of the conference and its related meetings. At an early stage in the proceedings, delegates considered a possible topic for inclusion in the conference agenda as the supplementary item. After deliberation, the conference voted to debate the situation in the former Yugoslavia. In resolving to pursue this course, the persuasive factors for delegates were the severe and extensive abuse of human rights which was occurring, the violence of the conflict, and the recognition of the need for increased efforts by the international community for the carnage to be stopped. The emphasis of the topic was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for urgent action in the former Yugoslavia, particularly as regards the protection of minorities and the prevention of further loss of life in order that peaceful co-existence and respect for human rights can be restored for all peoples.</PARA>
<PARA>As we have recently learned, the situation in the former Yugoslavia has descended to new depths of horror. In light of the appalling massacre in Sarajevo last weekend, particular urgency has been added to the conference resolution which condemned, in the strongest terms, atrocities against minorities, women and children, and the practice of ethnic cleansing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conference also expressed deep concern at the escalation of violence, aggression and occupation of territories, particularly in Bosnia-Herzegovina. The resolution emphasised that the international community should seek a solution which does not reward aggression and urge national parliaments and governments to take all necessary measures to protect human rights, implement humanitarian law, promote peace and achieve a lasting solution to the underlying causes of conflict in the former Yugoslavia. The full text of the resolution is included in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important consideration during debate on the situation in the former Yugoslavia was the need for more effective implementation of the United Nations total arms embargo on all sides as a means of ending continuing aggression in the area. A related issue, arms control, was also considered during the conference from the perspective of `transparency in arms transfers through a global arms register, notably as a means to check the growing use of violence to achieve political objectives'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution on this topic noted that the keynote of the evolving new world order must be understanding and detente and that the growing interdependence between states can be strengthened only by fraternity and conciliation. The conference called on governments to cooperate fully in the establishment of the register of arms transfers. It also called on members of parliament to bring pressure to bear on their respective governments to participate actively in the maintenance of the register and to promote acceptance for the concept of openness and transparency in the field of military activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second subject item of the conference was one in which I took great personal interest, and it concerned `the implementation of educational and cultural policies designed to foster greater respect for democratic values'. </PARA>
<PARA>The wording of the topic implied that democracy is the preferred, if not the best, form of government, and in that context I recall the words of Sir Winston Churchill who remarked that democracy is `the worst form of government, except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is incumbent on all those who embrace democratic ideals to ensure that democracy survives. The implementation of educational and cultural policies which help to foster greater respect for democratic values is therefore vital to all nations. I commented during the plenary consideration of this topic that Australia has adopted what has proved to be a satisfactory method of achieving this aim, achieving as it does a school-based approach of broad citizenship education with specific programs&mdash;most particularly those conducted by the Parliamentary Education Office and the Australian Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution on this topic detailed in the report recognised that education is a prerequisite for the acceptance and further development of democratic values in a process involving the participation of all citizens, and that cultural interaction can make an important contribution to international understanding and cooperation. It was emphasised that educational and cultural activities must be complementary if they are to play their part in individual fulfilment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a comprehensive statement, the conference noted that education programs must aim to instil in students the principles of democratic life and its foundations; knowledge of the institutions of their country and of a person's rights and responsibilities in today's world; the ability to reflect on the conditions and means of promoting respect for these rights and responsibilities; a capacity for personal reflection and critical analysis; and respect, tolerance and understanding of others. The conference invited members of parliament to urge their respective governments to adopt a global strategy to implement policies to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many other meetings were attended by the delegation during the conference. They included meetings of the Asia-Pacific group where prominence was given to the forthcoming IPU Asia-Pacific conference on science and technology to be held in Tokyo, and 12+ Group meetings. The delegation also attended meetings of the executive committee of the Interparliamentary Council. A notable feature of the council's deliberations was its resolution expressing support for the United Nations International Year of the Family. A particular highlight for the delegation was the opening ceremony held in the central hall at parliament house, during which addresses focusing on the ideals of the Interparliamentary Union were made by the President of India and the Prime Minister of India. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding my remarks, I wish to acknowledge the excellent role undertaken during the conference by the deputy leader of the delegation, Mr David Connolly MP, especially when I became ill, as I shall mention shortly. Thanks are also due to Mr Bill Nelson of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, His Excellency Mr David Evans, the Australian High Commissioner to New Delhi, and Mrs Evans, and members of the staff of the Australian High Commission in New Delhi. The names of many others who rendered particular assistance to the delegation have been noted in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving the good wine almost till last, I express my deep personal gratitude to the untiring and always helpful secretary to the delegation, Ms Anne Hazelton. It was she who summoned medical assistance for me when I was suddenly taken ill and hospitalised. Ms Hazelton unselfishly delayed her return so that she could accompany me when I was once again fit to travel and, during that additional time in New Delhi, she contracted the same complaint that had hospitalised me. It was a complaint which was to persist for both of us for months to come. It is a mark of Ms Hazelton's outstanding dedication that, despite being too ill to come to work for two weeks on her return, she still carried out her duties as IPU conference coordinator and was largely responsible for the highly successful 90th IPU conference hosted by Australia in Canberra in September. I firmly believe that Anne deserves official recognition for her outstanding efforts and achievements for the IPU and for Australia's involvement in that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again on a personal basis, I publicly express my extreme thanks to the medical practitioners, the matron and the nursing staff at the hospital in the grounds of the United Kingdom High Commission in New Delhi. I am by no means exaggerating when I mention that it was due to their care that I am able to be here today to report on the 89th conference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as I have noted in these remarks, the conference enabled members of parliament from all over the world to meet, discuss and formulate strategies on a number of issues of continuing international significance. On behalf of the delegation, I wish to thank our Indian hosts for their efforts in ensuring a successful conference. I commend the delegation's report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 27 May 1993 the former Deputy President, Senator Colston, presented the report of the Advisory Committee on the Proposed Creation of a Department of Parliamentary Information and Reporting Services and foreshadowed a response to the committee's recommendations in the Budget Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now before the Senate implements the recommendations of the committee's majority report which the Speaker and the then President accepted. Accordingly, the bill provides for the creation of the Department of Parliamentary Library and Reporting Services to replace the current Department of the Parliamentary Library (DPL) and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff (DPRS). The bill provides that the new department will come into existence on 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal advantage of the merger of the two departments will be improvements in the provision of information services to the Parliament. The new department will comprise the Parliamentary Library, Hansard, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Sound and Vision Office, all of which will operate as separate client service programs supported by a single administrative and corporate management structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will give the Parliament two service departments, one providing information services, the other&mdash;the Joint House Department&mdash;providing physical services. The Speaker and I believe that this structure is the most appropriate and effective one for the Parliament. We do not believe that any further reduction in the number of parliamentary service departments is warranted and we do not intend to propose that there be any further changes.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent years have seen major developments in the provision of information services. Increasingly, the services provided by the Parliamentary Library, Hansard, the Parliamentary Information Systems Office and the Sound and Vision Office have become more interrelated and more interdependent. This trend will continue&mdash;indeed, accelerate. The merger of DPL and DPRS will place the Parliament in a position to take the maximum advantage of developments in these areas, by bringing about much closer coordination of services and greater financial flexibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bringing together of the two departments into one will allow for greater efficiency in the corporate support areas and will lead to savings of around $1 million over the life of a Parliament. The money saved will be used to enhance services to Senators and Members. The savings will occur only as a result of attrition in staff numbers and only in the corporate services area of the new department. No present staff will lose their jobs, but as individuals are promoted, transferred, retire or resign, the positions vacated will be reviewed, and, where appropriate, not filled. No positions in the client services programs of the new department (that is, in the Library, Hansard, PISO or SAVO) will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators would be aware that the task of supporting the Parliament has grown substantially in recent years, in part as a result of the additional facilities and services available in the new building but also as a result of the expansion of the work of committees of both chambers. The Speaker and I wish to ensure there is maximum cooperation and coordination between the parliamentary departments, consistent with the constitutional independence and roles of the Senate and the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meetings of the heads of the parliamentary departments with the Presiding Officers have been a useful means of assisting in this process and the Speaker and I are anxious to continue to develop this positive approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Speaker and I believe that there will need to be more frequent and more wide ranging meetings of department heads with the implementation of this proposal. We have therefore decided to establish a more formal coordinating group comprising heads of each parliamentary department to provide an effective forum for ensuring the most efficient use of all resources available to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Advisory committee report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advisory committee's first recommendation was that a new parliamentary department be created to replace the Department of the Parliamentary Library and the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff. This recommendation was based on `the opportunity for the generation of savings which could be applied to enhance information services provided to Senators and Members'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee further recommended (Recommendation 4) that the name of the new department be the Department of Parliamentary Library and Reporting Services. This title reflects the historical importance of both library and reporting services to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's second recommendation was that a consultative group comprising representatives of management and staff of both departments be set up for a specified period to assist with the implementation of Recommendation 1. The Speaker and I have accepted this recommendation and have directed that a group be established from the consultative committees of both departments to carry out this task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amalgamation of the corporate services areas of the Department of the Parliamentary Reporting Staff and the Department of the Parliamentary Library will result in appreciable financial savings. The committee recommended (Recommendation 3) that the Presiding Officers seek the firm agreement of the Minister for Finance that the total appropriations for the two departments would be maintained in real terms for the new department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This assurance was given to the advisory committee by the Department of Finance but the committee believed that ministerial level confirmation of this would be appropriate. The Minister for Finance has confirmed this position in a letter dated 21 December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the Parliamentary Librarian is responsible to the Parliament directly through the Presiding Officers and indirectly through the Library Committee. The Secretary to the new department will have administrative responsibility under the Public Service Act for the management and administration of the whole department, but the advisory committee recommended (Recommendation 5) that the Parliamentary Librarian have the right of direct access to the Presiding Officers on library matters and be able to provide advice on matters within his or her professional responsibilities. This arrangement would be similar to that applying to the Chief Hansard Reporter since 1990. The Speaker and I have accepted this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Library Committee provides a forum for Senators and Members to discuss matters relating to the functions of the Parliamentary Library. The advisory committee recommended (Recommendation 6) that the Parliamentary Librarian, as the person with responsibility for the day to day running of the Library, be Secretary to the Library Committee or any equivalent body of Senators and Members. The Speaker and I have accepted this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee made a number of recommendations designed to preserve the perceived historical importance of the office of Parliamentary Librarian&mdash;and, by analogy, that of the head of Hansard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these was (Recommendation 7) that the positions of Parliamentary Librarian and Chief Hansard Reporter be statutory offices created under the Public Service Act 1922. The bill implements that recommendation, the purpose of which  is to prevent the positions being abolished by administrative action and to ensure that they can be dispensed with only by the Parliament's amending the Public Service Act. The proposed provision would not give the occupant of either position the authority or responsibility of a departmental secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three offices are directly affected by the terms of the committee's recommendations: the Secretary to the new department, the Parliamentary Librarian and the Chief Hansard Reporter. The committee recommended (Recommendation 8) that, in order to ensure that the positions were filled on merit, and were seen to be filled on merit, the positions of head of the new department, Parliamentary Librarian and Chief Hansard Reporter be advertised. The Speaker and I have accepted that recommendation as well as the consequent recommendation (Recommendation  9) that the Library Committee be consulted on the composition of selection panels for the positions of head of the new department and Parliamentary Librarian. The Speaker and I would anticipate a member of the Library Committee being on the selection panels for the latter positions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a program of the new department, the Parliamentary Library will report on its operations as part of the new department's annual report. However, the committee has recommended (Recommendation 10) that a report from the Parliamentary Librarian in respect of his or her responsibilities be included in the annual report of the department. This recommendation will be implemented by including a specific Parliamentary Librarian's report in the new department's annual report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's final recommendation, Recommendation 11, refers to the tabling of the committee's report in both Houses of Parliament. This recommendation has already been implemented by the tabling of the report on 27 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee suggested, though not as a formal recommendation, that the Presiding Officers make a statement of principle concerning the Library's independence. The committee identified two areas where, potentially, the Library's ability to serve the Parliament could be affected: firstly, reduction of services through management intervention, and, secondly, emphasis on technological feasibility rather than client information requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continuation of the Library Committee, with unchanged terms of reference, and the ability of the Parliamentary Librarian to go directly to the Presiding Officers on library professional matters will provide significant safeguards against such eventualities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Speaker and I place on record our commitment to the importance of the Parliamentary Library's role as a provider of independent information, research and advice to Senators and Members of all parties, as well as independent Senators and Members. The Speaker and I are also committed to the Library continuing to be funded at a level to enable it properly to meet client needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee commented on the need to clarify the roles and functions of the Parliamentary Information Systems Office (PISO) and its clients, principally the other parliamentary departments. This has been addressed by the Senior Management Coordination Group (SMCG) of the five parliamentary departments in its report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the relationship between the parliamentary departments and PISO: roles, responsibilities and funding arrangements</EMPHASIS>, which has been endorsed by the heads of the parliamentary departments and by the Speaker and me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraphs 5.10.9 to 5.10.11 of the advisory committee's report suggest the need for a review to clarify the functions and roles of the various information providers within the Parliament. Some aspects of this have been addressed in the SMCG report referred to, but the possibility of overlap between the information services offered by the Library and those offered by some other parliamentary departments is a matter of which the Speaker and I would hope all departments would be mindful.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although members of both the Government and the Opposition from both the Senate and the House of Representatives endorsed the majority report, three committee members produced a minority, dissenting report recommending that the proposed creation of the new department not proceed. As indicated by the introduction of the bill now before the Senate, this recommendation is not accepted by the Speaker and me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minority report also recommended that the majority and minority reports be tabled and debated before the Speaker and I make any response to the report and the dissenting report. The first part of this recommendation has been complied with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Speaker and I have considered the second part of the recommendation and have come to the conclusion that debate on the legislation currently before the Senate will provide Senators and Members with considerable opportunity to make their views known, particularly since they have had the opportunity to put their views to the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that Senators and Members had time properly to consider the proposal, which was first circulated to Senators and Members in September 1992, debate on this bill has not been brought on until now, more than two months after it was introduced into the House of Representatives and 18 months after the proposition was first put forward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The creation of the new department will benefit the Parliament by providing the potential for better information services to Senators and Members, better integration of available and future technologies and the ability to use a greater proportion of the Parliament's resources on direct service delivery to Senators and Members as a result of more cost-effective corporate support structures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a separate program of the new department, the Library will maintain its identity and high profile, just as Hansard has since the reorganisation of DPRS in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objective of the new department will be to provide the Parliament with library, reporting, information technology and communications services of the highest possible quality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterate the thanks of the Speaker and me to all members of the advisory committee for their very careful and thoughtful consideration of the proposal. I also thank all those individuals and organisations which assisted the committee in its deliberations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the debate was interrupted, Senator Teague concluded his remarks on the second reading of the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 1993. This bill amends the Higher Education Funding Act 1988. Among other financial adjustments, it provides for funding of 1,500 increased places for undergraduate students. That number includes 500 additional places to be jointly funded with industry. We look forward to industry playing an increased role in some areas of education provision in the higher education sector. We will monitor the success of the pilot program, which promotes closer cooperation between industry and universities. Whilst it is important that these courses are relevant to industry's needs, we do not want to see education beholden to industry and any other business or employment sectors. Of course, education has intrinsic value in its own right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome those additional places. We have strongly supported growth in the higher education sector for the past five years. We are committed to sustainable growth in higher education institutions, and condemn the fact that increased places have not been matched with funding for staffing infrastructure and capital works, as would be appropriate. We acknowledge there has been increased funding, but not to the extent that should have occurred to match those extra places. Groups such as the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee and the national student and academic groups of CAPA, NTEU and NUS support funding for at least an additional 4,500 places over the next three years to meet the level of demand for higher education places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns of the opposition regarding the allocation of increased places does not have a political basis. It has a political bias, but not a political basis. We support the creation of places on a needs basis. We do not believe the political circumstances are properly addressed by the coalition's concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill has, in its own way, stirred up the fees debate yet again. That was evidenced by Senator Teague's speech earlier today. I note that the first press release of the new Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) on the subject sought to clarify the fact that this bill does not raise the level of HECS payments, and I also note that that is not for want of trying. We saw evidence of that in the budget. Despite a purported commitment to access and equity in higher education by this government, the budget last year contained two punitive and regressive measures. Firstly, there was a minimum time rule which would penalise students who failed to complete their course in a certain time. Students so involved would incur a 50 per cent HECS increase for each additional unit studied. Secondly, there was the proposal for a doubling of the HECS rate for second degrees, which would hit hardest at women, part-time, mature-aged and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students, and which would see Australian students saddled with debts of around $45,000 for those who choose to undertake a second undergraduate degree and take out a student loan to facilitate that process. These measures were defeated by the combined forces of the Australian Democrats and the opposition in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' commitment to a fair and accessible education system is well known, but the opposition's decision to join with us in the interests of Australian students was a pleasing, if not expected, turn of events. It is with interest that I have viewed statements by the shadow minister, Dr Wooldridge, when debating this bill in the other place, and Senator Teague, when contributing to this debate today, in calling for the government to allow institutions to charge fees for undergraduate places. This call and those speeches seem strangely at odds with the coalition's newfound enlightenment when it comes to some parts of education funding. Logic would indicate that if opposition members are genuinely opposed to user pays education, as expressed in their previous votes here, they would not advocate up-front full-cost fees for Australian students, nor allow entry&mdash;as Senator Teague said&mdash;`for whoever on whatever grounds'. They would not be saying such things which would make our education system one for an elite, rich group. The Democrats do oppose, and will continue to oppose, the entrenchment of user pays principles in education. We do not support fees for education at any level&mdash;primary, secondary or tertiary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this week we have seen a flurry of press interest in the high levels of fees and charges in our state school systems. We often see this at the beginning of the school year, when people realise there is no such thing as compulsory free education in Australia. The fees, levies, or whatever one might like to call them, which are being charged in our state schools are rising, to the extent that they are parallel with some of the fees being charged in so-called independent schools. This is a situation which has been of particular concern to the Democrats lately, and we will continue to pursue this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to this particular bill, which deals with a suite of problems associated with higher education. I put opposition members on notice&mdash;not that they need to be&mdash;that their proposal for fees for above quota places will not be supported by us, which would not surprise them. Education in this country is coming with a rising price tag. Let us be clear that it is government and opposition policy; they are in concert in this regard. The government and the opposition are creating a situation where parents and students are being required to pay more for what is essentially government's responsibility to provide, in an equal and equitable fashion, education for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats welcome the targeting of places in regional areas and areas of population growth, but we do share some of the coalition's expressed concerns about the way those places are being allocated. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To answer the interjection by Senator Tierney, I am particularly disappointed that Tasmania has not been advantaged by this strange policy of the government. The claims by the coalition that places are being created on political grounds may be far-fetched and may highlight the fact its only concern about this bill is for political point scoring purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support the concerns of student and education groups regarding the discriminatory nature of quotas on undergraduate places for mature aged students. Growth in higher education enrolments and participation rates have, more or less, been in favour of postgraduate students. We have witnessed unprecedented levels of unmet demands in the 1990s amongst our school leavers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is undeniable that more places are required for undergraduate entrants, those places should not be at the expense of mature aged students. I concur with Senator Teague's observations about the qualities of mature aged students; that, by and large, such students are highly motivated and quite successful in their pursuit of tertiary studies. For the community at large, for the whole of the Australian nation, such students represent a very good investment. The amount of time, effort and money invested in meeting the needs of such students is well rewarded because of the normally high degree of motivation displayed by such students. We agree with Senator Teague that all students should have their place in the sun and the opportunity to pursue educational training. But that will not occur if the coalition has its way with fees and charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While additional places have been created for postgraduate students, we take issue with the massive deregulation of the postgraduate sector. Course fees for postgraduate students in this sector range from $5,000 to $35,000. There is no quality control. There are no adequate grievance procedures. This system is so unregulated that it really is starting to become a bit of a rort. If people such as Senator Tierney&mdash;who is about to contribute to this debate&mdash;are genuinely interested in this area, a little attention should be paid to this sector. Rather, it is being followed up in a fairly cavalier way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems as though a bit of political ideology is being followed here: if money is being charged for it and money is being paid for it, it is all right. It seems to reflect free enterprise. It is more laissez faire than anything else, is it not? It seems as though almost anything can go in this area. We really should be a little more cautious about endorsing such proposals. We are certainly very cautious about looking upon this growth with approval because it is threatening to overtake the traditional role of universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's audit report No. 14 of 1993-94, which deals with growth, change and equity in higher education, shows that grants per EFTSU have increased only moderately during the period 1989-91. That is one of the highest growth periods for secondary school retention and university entrance application&mdash;the two follow each other, of course. The reality is that, per student unit, funding is lower today than it was in 1983 when this government came into office. That is hardly something of which to be proud. It is a sad indictment of this government's alleged commitment to a fair education system. Those figures expose the rhetoric about making this a clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to refer to an associated matter that is also contained in this bill. Many of today's students are identified by a tax file number. The Democrats find that a regrettable feature of today's education system. The excuse for that&mdash;which the Democrats understand&mdash;is that, in order for students to repay their HECS debt through the taxation system, they have to be taxpayers and therefore have to have a tax file number. That is understandable if students want to use the deferred payment option and not pay the HECS fee up-front. It is obviously necessary that such students must supply the Australian Taxation Office and the education institution with a tax file number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill supposedly improves the arrangements for quoting tax file numbers in those circumstances. But the procedures outlined in the proposed amendments are, we believe, unnecessarily harsh. Proposed new sections 41B and 41C will allow an institution to cancel the enrolment of students who have not provided their tax file number. The bill explains the time limit for provision of that number. I foreshadow here our intention to amend section 42A to allow a period of grace of 56 days&mdash;two months&mdash;as opposed to 28 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole area smacks of another example of how the tax file number has almost become an accessory for living in Australia. It is a requirement for so many diverse areas of human endeavour that it has become an identifier&mdash;something that citizens have to cart about with them and be identified by&mdash;before they are allowed to participate in any of an increasing number of activities which normal citizens should be able to pursue without such a provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I find myself in a unique position here today in agreeing with Senator David MacGibbon. He expressed his concern earlier today about the need for veterans and people in receipt of disability pensions or some other pensions from the Department of Veterans' Affairs&mdash;payments which do not rely in any way upon people's taxpaying status, even if such people may not be taxpayers&mdash;to supply a tax file number to receive such payments. As I said, this is a unique experience for me to actually be in agreement with Senator MacGibbon but I do agree with his concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the education system we have an increasing requirement to provide a tax file number. As I said, I foreshadow seeking to amend that provision to at least allow people a greater amount of time to provide that. We have been told that there are administrative reasons, and perhaps even institutional reasons, for the period not being too long. But I only have to instance the experience of my own daughter&mdash;who, at 16 years of age, recently applied for a tax file number&mdash;to dispute that. After acquiring her birth certificate and identifiers such as bank accounts, tickets and all the other bits of chits of paper required to fill out the form properly, she was told that it would take only a couple of days to get her number. In fact, it was almost three weeks after the date of her application that she received the number. If she had been in the situation of registering at a university, it would have been a pretty close call between her enrolment and having to withdraw. Even in that instance, the administration and bureaucracy could have fallen over itself a little earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do have a proud record of standing up for the rights and privacy of Australians. It is something that the coalition seems to have abandoned recently, despite its claim to liberal principles. It is something which the government has certainly long since abandoned. Increasingly, the freedom of speech or free press and privacy are threatened. The intrusive use of tax file numbers is only one example of this. Our campaign against the Australia card will be remembered as an example of our defence of the liberties and personal rights of all Australians. I intend to continue that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 9 of this bill provides for funding adjustments to the open learning initiative. The Democrats believe that open learning should be an exciting technological advance that brings education a step closer for all Australians, especially those who are traditionally disadvantaged by distance, by home duties or by disabilities of one sort or another. But these groups will not be able to access the OLI if they have to pay prohibitive up-front course fees. I was glad to see the government introduce the deferred payment scheme for open learning in last year's budget after pressure from the Democrats and student groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue the push for the minimum course load requirement to qualify for the deferred scheme to be reduced from 75 per cent of the course load to at least 50 per cent, especially for those students who may be unable, for physical or employment reasons, to take the minimum 75 per cent load. That would concur with established practice for open learning and/or distance educational institutions internationally and in Australia in previous years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also appropriately exempts some students from HECS, including certain New Zealand citizens. It clarifies the classification of work experience and it supports offers of redundancy payments to excess staff. Many of these measures could be described as merely administrative functions which tighten up previous loopholes or inconsistencies. Of course, the Democrats will be supporting those changes. In short, this bill is an attempt to tidy up parts of the government education system, but real commitment to access and equity in education is not revealed by this package. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I rise to speak on the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill. I begin by following on from the final point raised by Senator Bell. He described this bill as a tidying up exercise for higher education, but I think it is a little more than that. I think that in tidying up the government is revealing a number of glaring errors in the system to date. I want to deal with two of those.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major aspect of the bill is in regard to the increase in the maximum level of recurrent grants, and related to that is the increase in grants for the superannuation guarantee levy. The bill also adjusts funds for open learning institutions over the 1993-95 triennium. This is due to the lower than expected demand for places in 1993. Finally, the bill clarifies the operation of the tax file number for students who take out loans from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by Senator Teague earlier, the coalition is not opposing the provisions of this bill but I think we need to focus on a number of measures and to really take a hard look at the failings of some aspects of the government's higher education policy as revealed by these measures. One of the most startling measures I found was the fact that the bill is announcing, two to three years ahead, the funding of precisely 1,500 new additional intake places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise we are on a system of triennial funding, but I am intrigued at the way in which this figure is so neatly tied down, and at the rather curious way in which it is proposed that universities will gain these places on the criteria being set by the government. One would have thought that in an expanding economy, which the government is touting greatly at this point, one of the benefits would perhaps be more funding so that higher education could fund more places. Who knows at this point how many might be funded? But we are tied down to this rather peculiar figure of 1,500. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has set out the basis on which it will allocate these numbers and, on the surface, it looks like quite a reasonable proposition. The government says that regions of high population growth and low tertiary education participation will receive priority. I do not think anyone could really argue with those overall criteria. They are two areas to which the government should direct funding. But then it brings in a rather strange secondary list of criteria, the basis on which one can receive this funding if one jumps over these particular government hurdles. As I read through the list I was increasingly amazed at how centralised our system has become if universities have to jump through all these hoops. One would have thought that with the dismantling of the communist system in eastern Europe we had seen the last of this sort of heavy-handed centralised control&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me take Senator Crowley through some of the provisions here, or some of the hoops that one has to jump through to get these places. I would like to put it in the context of the prize that is at the end of the tunnel. We are looking at 1,500 places across 36 universities. We have, as I will indicate a little later, excluded a number of states. Senator Bell indicated earlier that his state was one of the ones missed. But we are looking at only 1,500 places across a total of 36 universities. If we quickly do our maths, I think it comes down to something like 45 places per university.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a great prize, but the following hurdles have to be jumped over. Firstly, the universities have to show they have links with industry. Secondly, they have to show they are innovative in their modes of delivery of education, whatever that means. Excellence in modes of delivery of education is a very commendable thing, but I would like to know on an objective basis how one gets out there and measures it and how one determines the modes of delivery at the University of Western Australia are superior to the University of New South Wales&mdash;across what range of faculties and what staff&mdash;without employing a great army of bureaucrats to run around and measure such things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the extent to which agreed school leaver targets and undergraduate targets have been met. This is being set up by the government in a very centralised way even though in estimates DEET keeps telling us how decentralised it is becoming and how much decision making is moved back to the level of the universities. Time and again we come across things like this which show that that objective is a nonsense. As I move around the universities of Australia vice-chancellors and other senior officers tell me it is a nonsense. It is backed up by that point as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are equity group success rates and graduate employment outcomes, and also the quality of higher education provision. I assume that means resources, teachers and the way in which the programs are put together. Again, how do we measure that?

In this case they will not be provided to the right patients because the sorts of measures being used are very difficult to use. My basic point is that the government has come up with this rather strange set of criteria to allocate very few places across the university system and, out of government money, is allocating a miserable 1,000 places across the whole university sector.</PARA></TALK.START>

Firstly, how was that figure of 500 actually arrived at? How do we actually work out where those places will be? Do we know which industries and which faculties this money will be allocated to? I doubt whether we know that at this stage. The whole way in which this exercise was undertaken is yet another example of intrusion into university autonomy. It has centralised control written all over it. </PARA>

My state, New South Wales, does reasonably well. It has 350, so it has about one-third. New South Wales has about one-third of Australia's population, so I suppose that is fine. But where are the 350 going? They are going to Dubbo, Coffs Harbour, Lismore, Ourimbah and Shoalhaven. Admittedly these are within the parameters of growth areas, and I understand that, but the net effect, given that the cities of New South Wales are predominantly the areas where the largest population is found and where there is the easiest access to universities, is that there is absolutely no growth in the major university centres in Sydney, Wollongong or Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only growth that exists in the system is on the periphery. We need growth there, but it should not lead to there being no growth anywhere else. This highlights the point that the government is not putting enough money into this sector. There should be growth, as the vice-chancellor's claim, of 6000, not 1,500. If the government really stood by what it should be doing, it would be funding places in 1996 at four times the rate that it is doing now. With a rising boom, one would think it would be able to afford to do that, but it is not. It is starving an already starved university sector of funding. The infrastructure is running down, the standards of conditions of academic staff are running down, and the quality of education is running down, yet these people are getting no growth at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having just discussed New South Wales, I note that, regionally, the states of Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory received absolutely no growth at all. If I can pick on Victoria, it is hard to understand why outer Melbourne is not considered a population growth area. That is supposed to be one of the criteria, yet that area is getting no places at all. One would have thought that educational disadvantage existed in regional Victoria, but it is not getting any funding at all under this rather peculiar system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all due deference to my colleague Senator Reid, I see that the Australian Capital Territory is doing very well under this system. It has a very high tertiary participation rate and obviously it must be getting in on this act on the basis of being the second fastest growing part of the country. Again, there is plenty of provision in this area but in regional Australia and the more isolated and distant states there certainly is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect of this bill that I want to discuss briefly is: what happens under this amendment bill to funding for open learning? I have discussed this in the parliament a number of times. I raise again the issue of and the great concern about the developments in open learning in this country over the last two years. I make it perfectly clear that I am a great supporter of the concept of open learning. I was a student under it, and a lecturer and a director in this field. But I have been increasingly disturbed over recent years about the way in which open learning is going. We had a system that seemed to be working quite well. We had across the country nine distance education centres. We had concentrated open learning to some extent in a number of universities. They were developing their resources and programs in a way which was providing increasing excellence in education for people in isolated areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the 1993 election we had&mdash;I believe this was largely an election ploy&mdash;the promise to provide a lot more places for higher education through open learning. That sounded good on the surface, but the reality was that the government was using it as a political ploy.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Highly embarrassed by having more than 50,000 students not gaining places at universities, the government had this magic panacea that people could learn by television. It created what it called the open learning initiative and, in typical Labor government fashion, centralised it immediately in one spot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were many concerns about the process and the way in which this actually happened. We ended up with Monash University running this open learning system and contracting out work to the other institutions. This scheme has huge question marks over it in terms of funding and the quality outcomes which will come from such a low funding level. This has been raised before in the parliament and in estimates committees. One of the things which show the failure of the scheme is its take-up rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was criticised last year in the newspapers for commenting on the fact that the scheme was failing and that there was not a take-up rate. Lo and behold, the facts are out now; the figures are there. The government is finding that the money it allocated in 1993 could not fully be taken up. It has had to reallocate it across 1994 and 1995. We find that $15.8 million of this funding could not be spent because we had a situation where the enrolments were 3,000 and not the expected 8,000 to 14,000. So the government's claim before the election that it had a solution for the problems in higher education is revealed as a complete sham when only 3,000 students are enrolled in the system right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the fact that this open learning agency is struggling to meet its budget, despite the fact that the whole system is over-engineered and over-controlled, the government is persisting with an inappropriate system&mdash;one which has enormous funding difficulties, given that only $300 per unit is allowed to educate students. Having taught in this area, I do not quite know what $300 would buy. It certainly does not buy a good tuition system, it certainly does not buy a good communications system and it certainly does not buy an effective assessment system. Basically, what one gets for $300 is a video tape, a few notes, and not much help at all. I would not think that is the provision of quality learning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most insidious things about the system is the way in which it is bleeding resources from other universities. They join in with the system but receive funding only at a marginal rate. They do not even get the full $300. That is discounted by Monash, and they actually end up with $195 per unit. One cannot fund much for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are huge questions over this area of open learning and the way in which the government has run it through the open learning initiative; questions which I will be taking up further in the estimates committee. In this bill this shortcoming is shown up by the fact that funding for 1993 was not spent. Serious questions must be asked about the provision of further funding in the next few years and whether that will be taken up as well. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to a number of points in respect of the contributions made by Senator Teague, Senator Bell and Senator Tierney. Firstly, Senator Teague made some comments on the growth in higher education and the allocation of places. The 1996 growth of 1,000 additional places was allocated to areas of greatest need, as indicated by regions with high population growth and low tertiary education participation. The additional places were therefore allocated as follows: Queensland, 400; Western Australia, 200; New South Wales, 370; and the Australian Capital Territory, 30.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to the position in Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory. Firstly, places are not being allocated away from Victoria, as is suggested in the Victorian minister's press release that was incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> this morning. Victoria has previously received well above its population share of Commonwealth funded places. Victoria's share of places is above the population share and the rate of participation is well above the national average. Of some 393,000 persons with degree qualifications in Victoria in February 1993, only 278,000 were employed. That represents a smaller proportion than for the rest of Australia. In addition, Victoria's participation rate in higher education was 55 persons per thousand in 1992 compared with a national average of 50. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it would be irrational for the Commonwealth to allocate places to a state which, in real terms, is already above its share. If the Commonwealth were to attempt to equalise shares of places&mdash;which, of course, it is not&mdash;Victoria would lose some 12,000 places. In addition to the 1,000 additional places funded for 1996, 500 new joint Commonwealth-industry places will be available on a competitive basis. In previous years Victoria has received over 50 per cent of these. Given Victoria's industrial base, it could be expected to attract a sizeable number of such places again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Australia and Tasmania have a projected population growth rate of well below the national average. In respect to the Northern Territory, while eligible in the sense of meeting the allocation criteria, the size of the available pool of 1,000 means that the allocation for the Northern Territory would have been too small to be meaningful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to mature age students, the effect of the introduction of school leavers targets will be to restore the school leaver share of commencing undergraduate places to 1990 levels&mdash;around 50 per cent. Mature age applicants and non-school leavers should not be disadvantaged as they will also make up 50 per cent of commencing students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The school leaver targets do not use an age criterion and, therefore, do not exclude mature age students entering higher education directly from secondary education. Not all mature age students are offered a higher education place on the basis of a tertiary entrance score. There is not enough information at this stage to determine whether the introduction of school leaver targets has had an effect on opportunities for mature age students. The government has provided funding for some 11,000 new higher education places in 1994, a significant number of which will be taken by mature age students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague said he was disappointed that the open learning initiative did not appear to be reaching the projected number of students. The government has provided funding of more than $52 million over the 1993-95 triennium for the open learning initiative to support the establishment and operation of an independent open learning organisation, the Open Learning Agency of Australia, OLAA, and the establishment of an open learning electronic support service to provide enhanced student support services. Contrary to the remarks by Senator Teague, the department expects around 20,000 enrolments in 1994, in line with expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of Senator Bell's comments, the clauses he has proposed for amendment need to be read in conjunction with clause 42(3) and (5) of the bill. The 28-day period is only to apply after a student has obtained or sought a tax file number from the Australian Taxation Office and the ATO has advised the institution that there is a problem with the tax file number quoted by the student. This would only happen after the Australian Taxation Office had not been able to correct the problem after consultation with the student&mdash;for example, where a student quotes a false tax file number. An increase in the period allowed for the student to correct the situation is therefore unlikely to assist the student in these cases. An extension to 56 days would prevent the institution from reallocating a place in that semester.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the comments made by Senator Tierney, the challenge facing the government is to address community expectations for access to higher education in areas of high population growth and low tertiary education participation. A working party will be set up to consider the criteria and to circulate a discussion paper for consultation with the higher education sector, the vice-chancellors, the students and the academics. </PARA>

<PARA>I gave the reasons for these amendments during the second reading debate. I listened carefully to the reasons given by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) for the government not supporting the amendments. Although there is some degree of truth in what he said, an additional set of problems has been introduced because the tax file number will be used for more than taxation purposes. Intruding into a student's ability to enrol by introducing extra impediments in requiring a tax file number in certain circumstances deprives those students who are qualified to enter a tertiary institution. Such an impediment is neither just nor equitable. The government is purportedly concerned about access and equity in education but this impediment is not the right way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will persist with the amendments in the hope of bringing to the attention of the government the inequities caused by introducing these tax file numbers into the education system. After all, tax file numbers have nothing to do with education; they are supposed to be part of the administration of the Australian taxation system and, as such, have no place in education. If tax file numbers are to be used, students should have sufficient time in which to get their affairs in order and should in no way face any impediment. I will persist with the amendments even though the parliamentary secretary has given reasons for the government not supporting them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition does not support the amendments moved by Senator Bell. In no way does the opposition condone or give any kind of support for any inappropriate use of a tax file number, but that will not happen under this legislation. Rather, students involved in a contract for the higher education contribution scheme&mdash;those who have a tax liability&mdash;will be identified by their tax file number. That is, with regard to a tax matter there is a tax file number. The Australian Democrats are not opposed to these clauses; they are only seeking a change from one month to two months for the time in which an individual may clarify a dispute over a tax file number.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, serious consequences would flow by extending the 28-day period. Some of these problems might arise even within the 28 days. An enrolment not confirmed within 28 days would deny another eligible student keen to take up that place. Therefore, extending the period to two months makes the problem intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be certainty and responsibility for information on the part of the student in the administration of something like the higher education contribution scheme.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Offshore Minerals Bill is to be debated cognately with the Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill, the Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill and the Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Royalty) Amendment Bill, all of which are subsequent to and dependent upon the main Bill. The purpose of the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993 and subsequent bills is to replace the existing Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981 and to amend its associated acts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main function of this package of bills is to establish a uniform mining code for all offshore Commonwealth and state jurisdictions in regard to the exploration and production of all non-petroleum minerals. Offshore petroleum mining is regulated by the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. I will not go into a debate on this bill as the National-Liberal coalition is supporting it without amendment. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of bills is designed to facilitate a consistent administration of offshore non-petroleum exploration and production and to bring it in line with modern mining administration practices. There are currently only a couple of active offshore mineral explorations&mdash;one on the Ord River in the Kimberley region, and the other in South Australia's Spencer Gulf. It is anticipated that mineral exploration will increasingly move offshore in the future and will become a significant addition to the huge export earnings of the total mining industry. This bill, therefore, will become more relevant over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to a recent ABARE outlook conference, mining industry total earnings for 1994-95 are forecast to rise to $33.4 billion. The mining industry currently provides around 160,000 direct jobs and 470,000 indirect jobs. It is a major contributor to our national wealth. Legislation that proposes to streamline the administration of any facet of the industry&mdash;in this case the exploration and production of offshore mining&mdash;deserves, and will get, our utmost support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993 retains the key principles of the original act, which have a direct effect on the states. The principles include the provision that all offshore mineral activity in the Commonwealth area, adjacent to state waters, is governed by a joint authority consisting of the relevant state and Commonwealth ministers. The joint authorities are responsible for the major decisions relating to grants of title. The administration of Commonwealth legislation is carried out by the relevant state government in relation to the granting of permits, licences and fees for exploration, which is fitting as land management is an important function of the states. The existing 60 to 40 royalty split in favour of the states is also retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the drafting of this bill, widespread consultation with the state governments and the specific industries involved&mdash;such as the Association of Mining and Exploration Companies, AMEC, and the Australian and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council&mdash;have taken place over the past few years. It is anticipated that subsequent to the passage of this bill, the states and territories will introduce their own offshore minerals legislation to complement that of the Commonwealth. It will enable a uniform minerals code to apply all around Australia. The fact that this positive outcome is anticipated is due to the harmonious nature of the consultative process between the state governments and the Commonwealth, which I have touched on already. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to state how pleased I am to be speaking on this bill. It has eventuated as a result of the states and the Commonwealth working in harmony. It is unlike the bitter debates we have engaged in over such things as the Native Title Bill, and over the relationship between state governments and the Commonwealth in regard to land management. This bill represents the positive outcome that can result from a cooperative effort between both levels of government. As the shadow minister for resources and energy, Peter McGauran, stated in his speech on the second reading, this bill is a model of the cooperation that the Native Title Bill should have attracted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now discuss briefly the main provisions of the related bills in this package. The Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) 1993 repeals the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act 1981. It also amends the Associated Fees Act. The Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill 1993 deals with fees payable for the retention of licences. It introduces a new form of retention licence and provides for an annual fee to cover administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retention licence enables a permit holder to retain a proved mineral deposit without working it, if there is good reason for deferring the production stage. The fee structure for the new retention licence is consistent with other fee structures covering exploration permits and production licences in the existing acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minerals (Submerged Lands)(Royalty) Amendment Bill 1993 amends the Royalty Act. However, these amendments are purely technical in nature and do not affect the royalty liabilities of mining companies or the distribution of their royalties. We all know that exploration for mineral deposits in offshore areas always gives rise to environmental concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Australian Democrats will be moving amendments in relation to this. The coalition will not support these amendments as we believe their concerns in this regard are not warranted. I have been advised that mining exploration and production is already excluded from marine parks, as set down in the parks management report. There is no need for an amendment to prohibit mining in marine parks when it is already forbidden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Offshore Minerals Bill 1993 requires that any application for offshore mineral titles must meet the requirements of the Environmental (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. It should be stated that mining companies in recent years have become very aware of their responsibilities to the environment. They have become far more environmentally conscious. They should be applauded for their continued efforts in this very important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the Democrats' other amendments concerning confidentiality of information given by mining companies to the designated authority, it is my understanding that there is already a provision in clause 376 or part 4 of the main bill relating to information management that deals adequately with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my role as shadow minister for northern Australia and external territories, I would like to acknowledge the external territory offshore area covered in clause 14 in the main bill. This clause provides that our island territories of Ashmore, Cartier Islands, Norfolk Island, Heard Island, McDonald Island and Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are included in the adjacent areas provision. Christmas and Cocos (Keeling) Islands are not included in adjacent areas in the external territory offshore section in the current act, so the provisions in this bill to include them are welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my statement by praising the use of the new plain English style in the drafting of these bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Boswell has just pointed out, the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993 and allied bills are the end result of a long negotiation between the federal government and several state governments. It is unlikely that the alternative views, which I will now put, will be acceptable to the government. It may well be that the amendments that I will be putting later on will be unacceptable to the government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are well aware that in the past when there have been such things as agreements between the states or international agreements we have had great difficulty in changing the federal government's view in relation to quite specific amendments. It is partly for that reason that the Australian Democrats will be agreeing to the package of bills currently before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I would like to say a few things about these bills and about the philosophy that lies behind them. The package of bills currently before the Senate consists of four individual bills, namely, the Offshore Minerals Bill 1993, the Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993, the Offshore Minerals (Retention Licence Fees) Bill 1993 and the Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Amendment Bill 1993. As I have indicated, I will be moving amendments at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Offshore Minerals Bill 1993, which is the principal bill, replaces the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Act of 1983 which is repealed by the Offshore Minerals (Consequential Provisions) Bill. It establishes a licensing system for the conduct of offshore minerals resource development that may be undertaken in an area under Commonwealth jurisdiction. The bill is limited to mineral resources other than petroleum. It defines minerals as including sand, gravel, clay, limestone, rock, evaporite&mdash;I warn the minister that I will have a question on exactly what evaporite is when we get to the committee stage&mdash;shale, oil shale and coal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Offshore Minerals Bill contains four licensing systems: exploration, retention, mining and works licences. The retention licence is a new form of licence introduced by this bill. According to a briefing prepared by the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall), it is intended to be an intermediate form of minerals tenure between the exploration permit and the production licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The retention licence will allow a permit holder to retain title over an area for up to five years at a time without engaging in commercial activity. Although this sounds suspiciously like resource security for the mining industry, I am pleased that the renewal of the licence is not automatic. I will return to that point again in a minute. Licence holders will have to justify why they should continue to hold a retention licence. If the designated authority is not convinced of the merits of the case, the title will resume to the Commonwealth. The bill describes the kinds of conditions that can be attached to each of the four licences provided in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one turns to clause 10(1) of the bill one finds an interesting definition of how the position of a licence will be described. Among other things, it describes the earth as a spheroid and states that the position is to be worked out by reference to a spheroid that has a major equatorial radius of six million and so many metres and a flattening of so much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This draws our attention to the fact that what we are talking about here is the mining of a finite resource. I think this is a very important point at which to begin some of my remarks. The conventional economic wisdom, the wisdom that drives this government and this opposition, the wisdom that lies behind this legislation, is based on a widely held view which we believe to be false&mdash;namely, that resources are infinitely available and that we can go on exploiting them without detriment to the needs, aspirations and options available to future generations. In this bill we have the definition that the earth is a spheroid of a limited size. Clearly, then, the resources which are available to this and all future generations are limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic rationalist view, the market driven view, the deregulatory view and the small government view which predominates throughout government and opposition at this time says that resources are infinitely available because of two things. As we become richer both in technology and dollars we will be in a better position to recycle these resources to make the resources infinitely substitutable, and to use different technology to exploit resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It just so happens that when we look at the figures we find that since the Second World War the economy, according to the conventional measure of growth, has grown by a factor of three. Taking out the inflation factor, GDP per capita is now three times larger than it was at the end of the Second World War.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Despite that, we are told repeatedly that we cannot afford to attack many of our major environmental problems such as greenhouse. Despite the supposed unlimited increase in human ingenuity and technical progress, we are still apparently unable to tackle some of these fundamental environmental problems which are advancing at a pace, despite the increase in wealth as measured by per capita GDP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the economists, the opposition and the government are failing to recognise is that there is an inexorability about the run-down of resources. The second law of thermodynamics, perhaps the most fundamental law of the universe, tells us that as we go to lower grades of resources, as we exploit the earth's riches, the amounts of energy and complexity required to go down that trail inexorably increase. There is nothing that human ingenuity can do to change that inexorable law. It is not surprising, therefore, that despite the growth in the economy the real costs of getting resources are increasing faster than the economy is growing. In fact, that is the fundamental reason why we are unable to afford the clean-up of the environment which is caused by our rapacious use of resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have serious concerns about the general philosophy that lies behind this idea that we can now go offshore into the ocean and exploit the resources of the ocean. There are limits to how far we can do it and those limits are not fully recognised by government or opposition. That is the genesis of wanting to go into this newer and less exploited environment to exploit resources which we can no longer find on the land in adequate quantities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I point out that one of the conclusions that sort of argument leads one to is that it would be highly desirable to have an inventory of the resources available in Australia, not only to this generation but also to future generations. One of the things that has impeded the conservation movement in pushing that line for a long time has been that on land the possession of an exploration licence has automatically led to the right to exploit. If that obtains, one is very wary of exploring because it means that as soon as something is found the decision&mdash;which should be made very carefully&mdash;to exploit or to leave that resource for future generations cannot be made properly. It is made automatically in the light of the fact that there is an exploration licence and somebody has found something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly pleasing, therefore, to find in this legislation that the various licences are to be separated and that a licence to explore does not automatically lead to a licence to exploit. That is certainly a step in the right direction. Moreover, one finds in this main bill that, if a person or persons have a right to explore and that licence does not automatically lead to a licence to mine, they are not necessarily entitled to any compensation. I want to explore that factor also in a little more detail in the committee stage because I do not think it is entirely clear what `property' means. The bill sidesteps the issue by simply pointing to the constitution. As we know from the recent High Court case, the constitution does not give complete clarity to the definition of `property'. Nonetheless, we see the fact that these licences are to be separated as a step in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that, we are not averse to the idea of an intermediate licence, a retention licence, which lies between the right to explore and the right to exploit. We see no difficulty with allowing a company to hold a retention licence for a period of five years for various reasons&mdash;perhaps technical reasons relating to the inability to exploit that resource at that time, or related perhaps to the economic conditions or some other conditions&mdash;in the hope that at some limited time in the future the person or persons will then be able to exploit that resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We notice also that under subclause 43(1) and (2) the bill clearly recognises the question of native title. The granting of any of these licences does not supersede native title and native title is retained while these licences are in effect. No doubt, that will stir up the opposition as happened yesterday in relation to the wet tropics world heritage legislation. It is particularly pleasing to see that specifically mentioned in the bill and, of course, it is in conformity with the legislation that was passed late last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the question of the inventory for a moment, we have suggested an amendment because we do not think, contrary to what Senator Boswell just said, that clause 376 adequately deals with the matter. Clause 376 qualifies clause 27(1). Clause 27(2) has three conditions&mdash;(a), (b) and (c)&mdash;all of which are connected by an `and', not an `or'. Subclause 27(2)(b) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the person gives the Designated Authority a report that relates not only to those blocks but also to other blocks;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, that is a condition which has to be fulfilled before the information can be released. The clause also says that the information which is released that relates to those other blocks is not confidential information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this separation of the various sorts of licences is to fulfil the role we think it rightly should fulfil&mdash;allowing the establishment of a more comprehensive inventory of Australia's resources, not just for this generation but for future generations&mdash;clearly, at the time when the licences expire, that information should become public. That is the reason for that amendment. It is fundamental to the idea that over time we build up that sort of an inventory and we then more intelligently decide when it is that we will actually exploit a particular resource in the interests of this or later generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also somewhat concerned about the sorts of conditions which may be attached to licences. The bill describes the kinds of conditions that can be attached to each of the four licences provided for in the bill. The licence may&mdash;I stress may&mdash;include conditions requiring the licence holder to take out insurance; to lodge a security with the designated authority; to take steps to protect the environment of the licence area, including conditions relating to the protection of wildlife and minimising the effect on the environment of the licence area; and to repair any damage to the environment caused by the activities allowed for in the licence. It is our very strong view that these matters are so fundamental that these conditions should not be the prerogative of the designated authority to determine whether they are attached. These conditions should and must be attached to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I emphasise that even though a condition is attached, that is not to say that, if a mining company is not doing the right thing, the condition which is attached may necessarily be a particularly arduous one. But it does mean that with every licence given attention will be drawn to the need to protect the environment. Conditions will attach which will lead to the taking out of insurance and the repair of any damage to the environment. We feel that is quite reasonable and in conformity with the rest of the bill. I foreshadow a Democrat amendment to make such conditions mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other amendments deal with the issue of exploration and mining in marine parks and reserves. As honourable senators are no doubt aware, the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975 proscribes the recovery of minerals in wilderness zones. The recovery of minerals is defined in the act as including prospecting, exploration and mining activities. The act also proscribes the recovery of minerals in a park or reserve other than where the operations are carried out in accordance with the plan of management relating to the park or reserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are opposed to any exploration or mining activity inside protected parks and reserves. That is an absolute that we have held for a very long time. Exploration inside parks only creates commercial pressure to excise areas from national parks. We have seen the very considerable debate that went on in relation to the Kakadu National Park over many years with the initial declaration of Kakadu excluding certain areas and the subsequent inclusion in stage 3 of Coronation Hill and surrounding parts over which there were certain mining licences. But our belief is that mining is a totally inappropriate land use in these protected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are legislative examples where certain parks or reserves are protected from mining activity. I have mentioned already the Kakadu National Park as one such example. It is specifically protected under 10(1A) of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No operations for the recovery of minerals shall be carried on in Kakadu National Park.</PARA>
<PARA>The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 also specifically excludes mining activity in the park. Section 38 of the act states that no operations for the recovery of minerals shall be carried out in the marine park other than for the purpose of research and investigations relevant to the establishment, care and development of the marine park or for scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has four marine parks in Commonwealth areas. In each case the management plan excludes mining activity. But that does not mean in future necessarily that mining will be excluded in any further parks which are established. We believe that an amendment which excludes mining in marine national parks is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the precedent of no mining in marine national parks has now been set four times, it is time for the Commonwealth legislation to recognise that mining inside protected marine parks is an inappropriate activity. A legislative recognition prohibiting exploration of mining in national parks would provide a clear signal to the mining industry that parks exist to protect the environment and for the enjoyment of all future generations, not for commercial extractive uses.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens (WA) heard that the states and the various state departments of minerals and energy were very happy with the Offshore Minerals Bill. That is always a worry&mdash;especially considering the current level of environmental understanding that has been exhibited by a number of states, including my state. So we start with the same kinds of concerns that have been mentioned by Senator Coulter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset it is important to place on record the Green concern that this bill has not been referred to a Senate committee. The main bill in particular is a major piece of legislation with 440 clauses, plus schedules. Whilst I am aware that a substantial consultation process took place with both the offshore exploration industry and the state governments, I would point out that the bill's content is of major importance, as it provides the framework for offshore minerals exploration in this country and deserves serious consideration in the parliament through the Senate committee process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the limited time available to review this bill, however, we have some concerns relating to the environmental implications of the offshore mineral exploration that is the subject of this bill. This form of mineral exploration has potentially devastating implications for the environments in which they operate. Due to the fact that this work is carried out in marine environments, there are some unique ecological problems. In coastal areas, for example, the nature of the seabed can result in major siltation problems if any disturbance occurs as a result of exploration or mineral mining activity. Seagrass beds and reefs are good examples of marine ecosystems that could suffer devastating consequences of siltation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted in this regard that concerns about the ecological wellbeing of reefs, sea grasses and other marine ecosystems are not the preserve of radical greenies and conservationists. The economic wellbeing of the fishing and tourism industries, for example, are totally reliant on the continued health of these natural systems. The fishing industry in some areas would be wiped out. The reefs and sea grasses that act as nursery areas for young fish and crustaceans were destroyed by the activities of the offshore mineral industry. Given the enormous contribution of fishing and tourism to the regional economies in many areas of Australia, this could be disastrous for the entire economy of a town or region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I am pleased to see that the bill contains references to the need for the licence holder `to take steps to protect the environment of the licence area', this is not a mandatory condition to the exploration, retention, mining or works licences. As the bill currently stands, a joint authority may grant a licence on whatever conditions it deems, and these conditions may include certain environmental conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have heard from Senator Coulter, the Democrats will be proposing a series of amendments that will amend the requirement for environmental conditions to make them mandatory. The Greens wholeheartedly support these amendments and trust that the government will match with some positive action its rhetoric from earlier in the week about its wonderful environmental record, and that also it will support these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recognised that there are some mining activities, especially in offshore areas, which will not have significant environmental impacts. Having a mandatory clause does not affect that. We could easily, by requirements, simply write `No special conditions required'. At least the government has made a requirement that each kind of mining activity is dealt with or somebody has had the role of checking whether or not special environmental conditions apply in that case. To not have it or have it on an ad hoc basis seems to be a very dangerous precedent if the government is attempting to engage in a situation where there is a degree of certainty&mdash;whether it is for the mining industry, conservationists, or other industries that are dependent on the environment for their livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have an additional concern on this bill in the need to protect areas of high conservation value. This nation is situated on the smallest continent on the planet, with a vast coastline that contains some of the most unique marine ecosystems in the world. The Great Barrier Reef is obviously one of the better of these systems. There are many other areas, such as the Ningaloo reef in the north-west of Western Australia, that have been established as marine parks or marine reserves. These areas require an absolute guarantee of protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the special things about the Ningaloo marine park is that it is considered perhaps second only in significance to the Great Barrier Reef but, most importantly, is less damaged in many ways than the barrier reef. In fact, it is even more important in some ways as an example of a pristine ecosystem. It is something that we do not value enough in Australia because it probably makes it one of the second most important coastal reefs in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased, therefore, to see that the Democrats have proposed some amendments to this bill that incorporate a prohibition on offshore exploration or mining activity. The Greens fully support these amendments and trust that the government and opposition will also support this obvious and natural desire to ensure protection of areas of high conservation value. If we are going to allow mining  activity in any form in national parks or reserves, as is done in Western Australia, then we may as well eliminate the concept altogether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to refer briefly to clause 43, which relates to native title rights. I will be seeking an explanation from the minister during the committee stage of the intent of this clause, but I would like to place on record the Greens' commitment to ensuring that Aboriginal people have the right to participate in negotiations with respect to any licence applying to an area where native title rights may exist. I trust that the government is also committed in this regard. Nevertheless, the Greens will be supporting the legislation per se, despite the concerns I have outlined today. </PARA>

Senator Boswell referred to plain English, which is appreciated by anyone attempting to read legislation. The legislation will serve well the growing interest in offshore minerals exploration and production.

All decisions of the Commonwealth are subject to the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, and conditions will be framed after consultation with the Commonwealth Environmental Protection Agency.

<PARA>As I was explaining earlier in the second reading stage of this debate, it seems to me that one enormous potential advantage of this legislation which moves us forward from earlier mining legislation&mdash;at this stage it is only a potential advantage&mdash;is the ability to establish a resource inventory for Australia. But that depends upon the information becoming available once the exploration is over&mdash;if in fact that is not followed by a retention licence or a licence to mine. If exploration has been carried out and any licensing over that particular block lapses, it seems to me that that information should come back into the public domain. That is the way that we would progressively establish an inventory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised this matter with some of the advisers, they said, `Look at section 376'. I looked at that proposed section, but it is only part of clause 27(2). The three paragraphs of clause 27(2) are connected by the word `and'. In other words, every single paragraph has to be fulfilled before information can be released.

<PARA>In other words, there is a very strict limitation on the release of information. Whilst that is absolutely understandable in the context of confidentiality while a licence is in place, what I am seeking to do with this amendment, by amending (1)(a), is to say that once all of the licences&mdash;that is, exploration, retention and mining licences&mdash;have lapsed, then that information should become available. What I am attempting to do is to qualify proposed section 27(1)(a) so that after `designated authority' we insert the words `and the licence has not expired, or is a successor licence to the licence'. In other words, if a licence is still current, the information remains confidential, which is reasonable. But once those licences have lapsed, it seems to me in the public interest that information should become public information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say, as the parliamentary secretary tried to imply a few moments ago, that necessarily the department, the designated authority or whatever, has to go out and expensively publish that information. All it says is that the information is no longer confidential. If it is applied for, one can get access to that information. It may be for any reason. It may be that other people want to mine or explore. At least they are not duplicating an effort that has already been made, increasing the total expenditure on the community, by exploring for something which has already been properly explored. There may be other reasons. Other attributes of the block may need to be looked at, and at least it becomes a database. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that in South Australia&mdash;and this may be true in other states&mdash;the Department of Mines and Energy carries out very extensive exploration, and that information is in the public domain.

That seems to me to be not only reasonable but highly desirable in view of the commitment which this government has stated as to sustainability. In other words, one of the necessary bases for sustainability is establishing an inventory of the resources available, not only to this generation but to the next. </PARA>

<PARA>Nonetheless, proposed section 49 goes on to talk about compensation in relation to property acquisition. In my view, that begs the question: what does acquisition of property mean? To me, it means the acquisition of property in keeping with section 51 (xxxi) of the constitution. </PARA>

That should not be an element in any compensation. In my view, if any compensation is considered at all it should only relate to the actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the explorer, the miner or the person retaining the licence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week a great Western Australian died&mdash;Daisy Utemorrah of Utemorrah country. Her name is probably better known in Western Australia than was the name of Eddie Mabo in the Murray Islands. Like Eddie Mabo she did not live long enough to achieve her dream of having her native land returned to her people. But the dream will continue in her name.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I will not get involved in whether her claim will or should be upheld. It will never come to a conclusion so far as I can see. Honourable senators may ask why it will not come to a conclusion. I wish to place on record my views as to why it will not come to a conclusion. It will not come to a conclusion because of ATSIC and the way it has been performing in Western Australia. In Western Australia, and in other places, ATSIC has been playing favourites&mdash;as has this government. For a long time there has been a bone of contention. There was supposed to be an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the Kamali people of which Daisy Utemorrah was a member broke away from the Kimberley Land Council because their interests were not being catered for. Since then they have attempted to be heard by governments, ministers, the former Department of Aboriginal Affairs and now ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate committee ran around Australia on that fast and furious trip before the native title legislation, hardly any organisations knew what it was on about. Perhaps there was a reason for that. This government rushed that inquiry so as to be able to then rush the native title legislation through this Senate. Probably the committee had no time to let everyone who was interested know so they could appear before it. The government, in its ever growing haste to get this legislation through parliament before Christmas, was, of course, aided and abetted by the Greens and the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem started in Queensland. Honourable senators will remember that the jaunt around Australia by the committee started in Brisbane. I would like to quote very briefly from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard </EMPHASIS>report of the sitting in Brisbane. Perhaps even my colleagues might listen to this. Mr Wharton was asked by the chairman who he was representing. He replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You asked me to represent myself and state who I represent. It is a pity that people did not ask the magnificent seven when they were down in Canberra who they represented and who they were supposed to speak for. It is a shame that it comes around now, when I am getting asked who I represent.</PARA>
<PARA>He let the committee know that the people who went to Canberra at the time did not represent all the Aboriginal communities of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The position is the same with the Kamali group in Western Australia. The Kamali people were not told that the committee would be in Western Australia, and they were not invited to make a submission. After all, they have been divorced from the Kimberley Land Council for at least 10 years. That Kimberley Land Council, which does not speak for the Kamali group, had enough money to send four people to Perth to be heard by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Kamali group does not accept the KLC as its representative, it should have been given the opportunity to be heard but it was not allowed to do so. The same sort of thing occurred in Queensland. This committee, as it did in Queensland, only listened to a small group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the Kamali group has been very ably represented by a Rosemary O'Grady. The whole community has been starved of finance to fight its case. In October 1993 the local ATSIC in Derby approved funds for the ongoing fight to get equity. The approval was sent to Canberra but did not arrive here. I have the government gazette and I will quote that on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land title claim that the Kamali group are fighting for in Western Australia is a pre-native title claim&mdash;pre-native title in Western Australia and pre-native title that the federal government rammed through this parliament before Christmas. The group is continuing its action in the Supreme Court of Western Australia without any finance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put the situation in perspective, the Kamali people represent 2,000 Aborigines in the Kimberley and the Kimberley Land Council represents 2,000 only. If the Kamali group represented no more than 100 people and the rest of the 4,000 backed the Kimberley Land Council, I would not question the council's motives. But when we have the Kamali group representing 2,000 people&mdash;in other words, half the number of the people in the area&mdash;I believe it should be listened to. Indeed, it has not been listened to for the past 10 years. No matter where they turn to try to get equity to keep this land claim going before the Supreme Court of Western Australia, they are told that there is nothing whatsoever available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I talked to people in the Kamali office in Western Australia and I asked them to fax me some material on their claims for finance. They told me that they are so starved of finance that they did not even have a fax machine. That is how bad it is. Whatever the outcome of that Utemorrah land claim, it will have to go through the courts to be sorted out. I am not going to prejudge whether the claim is right or what the result of the claim will be. But I believe that the Kamali people have certainly got a case that must be heard by the Supreme Court of Western Australia, the court which at present they are locked into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the minister to find out why they are being starved of funds and I ask him to put the situation right. As Senator Bell would know, I have been attempting to get an inquiry into the workings of ATSIC to make sure that everyone gets access and equity. I intend to move later this year for an inquiry which can determine why people are not being treated equally. The Kamali group tell me that this has been going on for quite a few years. Just like the Kalgoorlie people, the Kamalis are not getting their fair share of equity. I call upon the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, and the Senate to take note of what I have said and to see that justice is done in this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two issues in relation to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992. The first relates to tobacco advertisements of less than 1.5 square metres. According to regulation 10A, such advertisements have been illegal since 30 September 1993. But there are many of these advertisements still on display in Hobart at least, and I daresay in other parts of Australia as well. The question that the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) should answer is whether these advertisements are in breach of the act.

Anderson and Cumming had heard nothing from Senator Richardson or his department, not even an acknowledgment. They wrote again on 15 December 1993 but again heard nothing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a democracy it is important that ministers of the crown and bureaucracies respond to concerns and complaints from the community. In my view there can hardly be a more legitimate complaint than in relation to tobacco advertising. Senator Richardson has had photographs and other detailed information. He has had three letters. Why is it not possible for him to answer? Is it that he does not want to upset any mates in the tobacco industry? In my view, his inaction is a violation of his mandate to uphold the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I raise relates to exemptions that the Minister for Health can specify for tobacco advertising associated with international events. On 15 September 1993, in the government <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, the minister gave an exemption for the Adelaide Grand Prix. That grand prix was held in the first week in November 1993, but the exemption from the prohibition on advertising lasts until 14 September 1994. In other words, in September 1994, cigarette companies could claim to be still advertising their product under the guise of promoting the November 1993 Adelaide Grand Prix. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that is a nonsense, outrageous and a con trick on the Australian community and Australia's young. I cannot agree in principle with any exemptions to the ban. But if we must have exemptions, then surely the exemptions should be for the promotion of a sporting or cultural event. It should not be a Clayton's exemption that allows promotion after the event. Looking at the semantics, I wonder whether it could be a promotion after an event. Should it not perhaps be a demotion? What is the term for continued publicising of an event which has already occurred? It certainly should not be promotion. Surely on the grounds of common sense the exemption should end a day or two after the event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no other option but to call on the minister to abide by the spirit of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act and limit the length of time for exemptions under the act to a day or two after the event itself, leaving practical time to remove any promotional material. Failure to abide by the spirit of the act means that the minister is undermining the act, the work of his own health department and health departments around Australia by not encouraging a lowering of the incidence of tobacco consumption in our community. </PARA>
