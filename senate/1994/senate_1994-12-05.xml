<TITLE>Recycled Paper</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable The President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Petition undersigned shows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That we, the citizens of Western Australia believe that the firm policy of support for the principles of recycling of paper as contained in the successive Statements on the Environment by Prime Ministers Hawke and Keating has not been followed up by policies of support for recycled versus non-recycled paper products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The expiry of supportive transitional arrangements equating to a concessional sales tax rate of 10.5% without a promised review on the continuation of such arrangements leaves the fledgling recycled paper products industry in Western Australia on the same sales tax rate as non-recycled paper products 21%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strong commitment by the West Australian community at all levels to recycling will be placed in jeopardy if participants in the industry are forced for commercial reasons to transfer their activity away from recycled to non-recycled paper manufacture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it is essential that the government, community and industry work together to "close the loop" between the community's efforts to collect recyclable materials and industry efforts to use 100% recycled materials to create value added consumer products. With 600,000 tonnes of office waste paper currently going to landfill in Australia, at a minimum cost to the community of $15 million, we need to redouble our efforts in this area, NOT WITHDRAW SUPPORT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This emerging recycling industry has come a long way in its first five years&mdash;the West Australian community has stopped more than 30,000 tonnes of office waste paper over this period going into landfill by recycling it into tissue products. Over $6 million has been passed back into the community through payments for the office waste paper. Industry has now invested more than $10 million in technology, R&amp;D and infrastructure&mdash;Now is not the time for the Federal Government to withdraw support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our petition therefore asks the Senate not to impose a 21% wholesale tax on 100% recycled tissue paper products but support the recycling industry by applying the "virtuous products" tax of 11% or giving an equivalent level of support for 5 years.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Suddenly, as from August 1994, this service has been changed and this has caused serious problems for the local Italian community, already isolated due to the lack of Radio and Television information in ethnic language.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the trading of new and innovative products on Australian securities and futures exchanges. It will permit the trading of new products on a more flexible basis than is presently possible under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substance of these amendments was originally included in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 March 1994. Those amendments were intended to facilitate the trading of a new product by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) from 1 July 1994. The amendments were withdrawn from that bill to allow for further public comment on the proposals and to permit exposure of draft regulations and business rules in support of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exposure package of documents was released on 5 September 1994 for public comment by interested parties. The exposure package included the draft bill and regulations, draft explanatory memoranda and a summary of the share ratio business rules prepared by the ASX. Overall, there has been a favourable response to the proposals. In particular, the Australian Securities Commission, the Securities Institute of Australia and the International Banks and Securities Association support the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Government policy to assist the Australian securities and futures industries to grow and develop. These industries play an integral and important role in Australia's financial markets. They are vital to Australia's future as a mature and stable economy. Through these industries Australia can develop as an important financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region. The ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hold key positions in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the commencement of the national scheme for corporate regulation on 1 January 1991 the Government has endeavoured to facilitate competition in, and promote the international competitiveness of, Australia's securities and futures markets. Through legislative change and the administration of the law by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) our markets have been encouraged, not stifled, by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amongst other initiatives the Government has facilitated the introduction of an electronic clearing facility to enable the ASX to meet best international practice standards in the clearance and settlement of share transactions. Legislation has been enacted to facilitate the establishment of retail screen based trading markets for collective investment schemes. This will provide a new market for investors to trade units in collective investment schemes. The Government has also approved the New Zealand Futures &amp; Options Exchange, a subsidiary of the SFE, trading its products on a screen based system in Australia. It is important to appreciate that the general policy thrust of this bill is a continuation of this policy of encouraging competition in the financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that the future success of the exchanges depends in part on their capacity to develop and market innovative new products in response to changing financial needs and circumstances. Both the ASX and the SFE have shown that they have the capacity to develop such products. It is important that this activity not be frustrated by regulatory structures which inhibit product development or encourage business to go elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Corporations Law trading in futures contracts and securities is separately regulated. Generally speaking, under the current law futures contracts are only able to be traded on a futures exchange while securities are ordinarily traded on a stock exchange. Strict penalties apply if securities or futures contracts are traded in breach of the Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present rigid definitions of `securities' and `futures contracts' in the Corporations Law can operate to prevent the trading of new products on a particular exchange, in circumstances where there may be valid reasons why they should be able to be traded on that exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those definitions were developed some time ago. There has been significant growth in derivatives markets and development of new financial instruments and products since that time. These developments were not contemplated when the basic legislation was first formulated. For some of these products, the existing regulatory provisions are not the most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore decided to amend the Corporations Law to introduce greater flexibility into the definitions of `securities' and `futures contracts' in the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Share Ratio Contracts</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The catalyst for the introduction of these reforms at this time is the new product, termed a share ratio contract, recently developed by the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A share ratio contract is a derivative financial instrument. It combines the features of a security and a futures contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX is presently precluded from trading this product on its securities exchange because a share ratio contract does not fall within the existing definition of securities. However, there is a close relationship between a share ratio contract and securities which are already traded by stock brokers on the ASX. Share ratio contracts require a knowledge of the performance of individual shares. Stock brokers will be equipped to provide advice about such contracts. They will be required to demonstrate that they have relevant experience and education and have completed a training program conducted by the ASX in relation to advising and dealing in share ratio contracts. All share ratio trading will be supervised by a senior representative of ASX member organisations. In light of these arrangements the Government is of the view, therefore, that in this particular case and, in the context of the regulatory arrangements being developed, it is reasonable for share ratio contracts to be traded on a securities exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the bill will permit the regulations to prescribe particular exchange-traded agreements and to regulate such agreements as if they were securities or futures contracts. The first such agreements to be prescribed, share ratio contracts, will be prescribed and regulated as if they were securities, enabling the ASX to trade its new product on its securities exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also permit the prescription of other products in the future, thus ensuring a quick legislative response to developments in derivatives markets and the emergence of new products by enabling those products to be approved for trading on stock exchanges or futures exchanges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to prescribe products will be used sparingly. Nor will these amendments have any application to mainstream products which fail to be regulated under the respective regimes already in place. These will continue to be governed by the existing regulatory regime prescribed in the Corporations Law for securities and futures contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to ensure that appropriate regulatory standards apply to share ratio contracts and other products that may be prescribed, the bill provides that regulations may modify the application of the Corporations Law to such products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enable the regulations to selectively apply the most appropriate provisions of the Corporations Law to the products to ensure that a suitable regulatory regime is in place for their trading and that investors are adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exposure package for this bill illustrates how this is to be achieved. The draft regulations in that package prescribe share ratio contracts for the purposes of  the Corporations Law, and modify the provisions of the Law as they apply to such contracts. The essential features of a regulatory scheme for the trading of share ratio products will include: the licensing of dealers, the conduct of dealers' businesses, dealers' accounts and audit, the handling of client moneys, fraud and market manipulation and fidelity fund arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Guarantee Fund (NGF) will guarantee share ratio contracts traded on the ASX. I am advised by the ASC that an independent actuarial study has confirmed that the resources of the NGF are sufficient to meet any reasonable foreseeable claims arising from trading in share ratio contracts. The ASC has stated that the report confirms that any potential losses from the trading of share ratio contracts would not undermine the financial resources of the Fund. In addition, those provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with investor protection and the maintenance of fair, competitive and orderly futures markets will be part of the regime applying to share ratio contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other rules governing the trading of share ratio contracts will be set out in the business rules of the ASX. Those rules have been comprehensively reviewed by the ASC in order to ensure that the standards applicable to the trading of risk management products are adhered to. Those rules are subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Over the Counter Derivatives Markets</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterate the comments I made during the course of the debate on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, that the Government does not intend to regulate over-the-counter derivatives markets under these amendments. The power to prescribe agreements, contained in this bill, is limited to agreements traded on an exchange. This bill has nothing to say about the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Review of derivatives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is presently undertaking a review of the regulation of derivatives.  It is expected that this review will also address the policy issue of the trading of derivatives on securities and futures exchanges. However, this review process will take some time to complete. Any amendments to the Law arising from it may be some time away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will assist the development and trading of new derivative products in the interim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial markets and the needs of their users are evolving in ways that were not envisaged during the 1980s. New and innovative products continue to be developed and traded by derivatives markets. Provided adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors and the integrity of financial markets, the Government must be able to respond to requests by exchanges to trade new products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have noted, the Government has encouraged our securities and futures markets to compete in global markets. It has sought to facilitate the exchanges by modifying the Law to make the regulatory framework responsive, flexible and adaptable while, at the same time, not reducing investor protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share ratio product has been welcomed by local institutional investors and it is anticipated that it will gain acceptance in overseas markets, thus considerably enhancing the international reputation of Australia's securities markets. This bill provides a mechanism for facilitating the development, not only of this particular product, but other new financial products in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on Government or business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation the Ministerial Council on Corporations has been consulted on the bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the taxation laws in a number of respects. It includes measures which give effect to certain announcements in the 1994-95 Budget and the Working Nation White Paper of 4 May 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Employee share acquisition schemes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will give effect to the 1994-95 Budget announcement by the Treasurer on 10 May 1994 that employee share benefits provided by an employer to an employee in respect of employment will be subject to fringe benefits tax (FBT). Transitional arrangements will apply so that in certain circumstances the existing provisions of the income tax law will continue to apply to shares or rights to shares acquired after 10 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is making these changes to reduce the exploitation of the existing legislation and to ensure that the tax concessions that are available under the new arrangements are directed at share schemes which encourage employees to own shares in the company by which they are employed or a holding company of their employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures will significantly increase the taxation benefits available under schemes which encourage investment by employees in their employer company and which are available to all permanent employees on a fair and equitable basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986 (FBTAA) so that FBT will be imposed on employee share fringe benefits which arise when an employee (or associate) acquires shares or rights to shares for an amount less than the market value. The amount subject to FBT will be reduced by any amount paid by the employee or associate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two concessions are available which can further reduce the taxable value of the benefit where certain criteria are satisfied. These concessions are referred to as the `exemption concession' and the `deferral concession'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `exemption concession' is available where there are restrictions on the sale or disposal of the shares or rights and the restrictions exceed a five year holding period. Where this concession is used the taxable value of the benefit can be reduced by up to $500.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `deferral concession' is available where there are restrictions on the sale or disposal of the shares or rights and the restrictions exceed a five year holding period but do not extend beyond 10 years. Where this concession is used the taxable value of the benefit can be reduced by up to $1500. An amount will be included in the employee's assessable income in the year in which the restrictions on the shares or rights cease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will allow an employer to claim an income tax deduction for the amount of the exemption or deferral concession.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the capital gains provisions to ensure that the advantage gained by the concessions will not be `clawed-back' through those provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of these measures is such that a reliable estimate of the revenue impact cannot be provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Research and development activities</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the research and development tax concessions to give effect to the changes announced in the Working Nation White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first change is that the shading-in rules which currently apply where a company's research and development expenditure is between $20,000 and $50,000 will be eliminated. The full 150 per cent deduction will be allowable for the 1994-95 and later years of income where the total research and development expenditure is more than $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second change will extend the concession to expenditure incurred on certain research and development activities undertaken outside Australia. Expenditure incurred on research and development activities conducted outside Australia must be given prior approval by the Industry Research and Development Board. The Industry Research and Development Act 1986 will be amended to give the Board power to develop public guidelines specifying the criteria that companies must satisfy for their activities to be approved by the Board. Some of those criteria are to be set by these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third change will amend the Industry Research and Development Act to reduce the expenditure threshold from $1 million to $500,000 for companies registering jointly on or after 1 July 1994 in respect of a proposed research and development project starting on or after that date. This change will facilitate the use of syndicate structures for smaller research and development projects which is expected to benefit small-to-medium-sized companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduced expenditure threshold is estimated to cost the revenue $2 million per annum from 1995-96. The tax deductibility of expenditure on overseas R&amp;D activities cannot be quantified, but it is expected to have some cost to revenue. The reduced expenditure threshold for syndicates is estimated to cost the revenue $4 million per annum from 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Pooled development funds</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Working Nation White Paper the Government announced that the rate of tax on income derived by a pooled development fund (PDF) from its investments in small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) would be reduced from 25 per cent to 15 per cent. This change, which is designed to increase the attractiveness of the PDF program to investors, will apply to the assessments of PDFs for the 1994-95 and later years of income.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 9 September 1994 the Treasurer announced retrospective amendments to the income tax law relating to the tax treatment of surpluses repatriated to an employer from a superannuation fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments ensure that any payment or benefit from a superannuation fund, other than a payment or benefit to a member, is included in the assessable income of the recipient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments is to overcome arrangements entered into by taxpayers whereby the surplus from an employer sponsored superannuation fund is repatriated to the sponsoring employer, or an associate of the sponsoring employer, in a way which avoids the payment of tax on receipt of the surplus. Those arrangements are in breach of the clear thrust of the existing law and represent a serious threat to the revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To allow surpluses to be repatriated tax free would also give an undeserved benefit to employers at the expense of the taxpayer community in general. Therefore, the proposed amendments apply from 1 July 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of the proposed amendments is difficult to quantify. However, the measure will remove scope for substantial revenue leakage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Children's income</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The income tax law generally taxes certain income of minors at a higher rate to prevent taxpayers diverting their income to children for the purposes of avoiding their proper tax responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition that not all unearned income of minors should be taxed at a higher rate, the law was intended to relieve from taxation at the higher rate, income derived by a minor from the investment of property transferred to the minor as part of a legal settlement in connection with a family breakdown. However the law did not achieve this because the words used in the relevant relief provisions are inconsistent with the Family Law Act 1975. Amendments in the bill will ensure that Parliament's original intention to provide relief is fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments will clarify the anti-avoidance provisions relating to a minor's unearned income. Specifically, the amendments will continue to limit the relief from the higher tax rate to ensure that the amount qualifying for relief is no more than an arm's length rate of return on the property transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment of the anti-avoidance provisions will prevent a potential loss to the revenue of around $6 million per year.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing income tax law, successful cash bids for the granting of off-shore petroleum titles are deductible over 10 years or the life of the petroleum field, whichever is the lesser.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to extend this deduction to successful cash bids for on-shore, and overseas petroleum titles, and onshore, offshore, and overseas mineral titles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures are consistent with the Government's general approach to taxation policy, which is to enhance equity between taxpayers and remove obstacles to worthwhile investment. The bill will ensure that Australian explorers and miners operating overseas are not disadvantaged whether they operate onshore, offshore or overseas in making cash bids: all successful bids will have the same Australian tax treatment, and so no area of bidding will be comparatively advantaged or disadvantaged.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions will apply to payments and refunds of company tax relating to the 1994-95 and later years of income for small and medium instalment taxpayers, and the 1995-96 and later years of income for large instalment taxpayers.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Employment Services Bill establishes Employment Assistance Australia within the Department of Employment, Education and Training to give effect to the case management system announced in the government's Working Nation statement as a central element to the job compact. The bill also establishes the Employment Services Regulatory Authority as an independent statutory authority within the employment, education and training portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition will not be opposing this bill, but we will be moving some amendments in the committee stage of the bill. The coalition is pleased to see a decline of the appallingly high unemployment numbers this country has been forced to endure. But I do have grave doubts that Working Nation and the programs contained therein will provide any relief to those people who are unemployed, and their families who are also affected by unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is aimed at the close to 900,000 unemployed people in Australia. I will give some background to these figures. In an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of last week entitled `Hard decisions needed to give unemployed hope' Professor Helen Hughes, the director of the full employment project, based in Melbourne, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When unemployed people and those that are so discouraged that they have dropped out of the workforce are included, total unemployment is still well over 10% of the workforce.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are more than 300,000 long term unemployed Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders and immigrants who do not speak English who have more than double the unemployment rates of the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nearly 60% of the single women heads of households are unemployed. Unemployment has become hereditary. The proportion of young people not working in households where one or more parents are unemployed is double that of households with employed parents. Some 700,000 children under 15 are affected by parent's unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>These figures give some idea of the realities behind the often bland statistics that are bandied around. The social impact of the worst recession in 60 years has yet to peak. Family breakdown, measured by divorce rates, has reached a 10-year high. For the almost 900,000 unemployed Australians, the recession is still a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper is not about providing employment; it is about shuffling people from dole queues to training programs and, in so doing, making it appear that the government is actually doing something. There are no real industry initiatives in Working Nation to encourage businesses to take on more staff and, until this happens, the major problems of unemployment will not be solved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large drop in the unemployment figures is made up of people between the ages of 60 and 65 years who have gone on to the mature allowance and are no longer required to look for work&mdash;another government sleight of hand to maintain the charade that it is tackling unemployment. In response to questions I raised in this place last Tuesday regarding the youth training allowance, Senator Schacht said, `Of course it is not possible to guarantee a young person that the training will necessarily lead to employment.' I am glad that the government realises that Working Nation is unlikely to really help ease the burden of unemployment, although it would have been pleasing if it had actually addressed this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the government will have read the report by the full employment project, which I mentioned earlier, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achieving Full Employment</EMPHASIS>, which was quite scathing, to say the least, of this government's failure to implement policies which will effectively reduce long-term unemployment. The study reiterates the comments I have just made that the job compact will only shuffle the queues of the long-term unemployed but will still leave in place more than 300,000 long-term unemployed by the end of the decade. As the study says, some of the youngsters leaving school this year&mdash;at the end of 1994&mdash;will still be unemployed when the Olympic Games come to Sydney. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Birthdays, Christmases and school holidays become guilt ridden as children are deprived of pleasures that other Australians take for granted. A beer, a cup of coffee, having family or friends to a meal have to be forgone&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or seriously thought about. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many people's lives collapse under the financial and psychological stresses of unemployment. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Among key conclusions of the study are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Working Nation's `job compact' may seem to be effective as the recovery creates additional jobs, but as the process continues it will be evident that the `job compact' merely recycles the unemployment queues.</PARA>
<PARA>The study goes on to conclude that, by the end of the decade, the present unemployment queue might be shuffled by a successful jobs compact program&mdash;and success is doubtful&mdash;but only to create a different group of more than 300,000 long-term unemployed. The study further concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt, however, that a downturn by the late 1990s is possible and even likely. The combination of a downturn with less than sustained 4.75 per cent annual growth would mean a return to double digit unemployment before or by the end of the 1990s. Unemployment could even be higher than the 11% peak of the last recession.</PARA>
<PARA>To paraphrase, the report says that only a dramatic acceleration of economic policy reform, a radical reappraisal of work practices and a tripling of Australia's manufacturing exports would allow a return to full employment by the year 2000. I suggest to the Senate that none of these policies have effectively been put in place. The report goes on to say that Australia's growth potential is being undermined by weak macro-economic policies, election cycle fiscal policies and over-regulation of the labour market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report calls for the abolition of penalty rates, the removal of shift work restrictions to allow 24-hour operation of manufacturing plants and a reinvigoration of post-secondary training and education as preconditions for significant jobs growth in the economy. It is also extremely critical of the Dawkins changes to education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that Australia's work force is expected to grow to 9.2 million people by the year 2000. To reduce unemployment to at least three per cent would then require the creation of about 250,000 jobs every year for the next six years. On current economic growth projections this will not occur. I quote again from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If cyclical downturns continue to occur in the Australian economy, unemployment levels are likely to be around 7 or 8 per cent in the late 1990s, and they could ratchet up again in an economic downturn to 11 percent or more.</PARA>
<PARA>No amount of training programs or the provision of case managers will aid that projected number&mdash;11 per cent of Australians who are unemployed. Small business is the key to increasing employment and yet it is this essential group that the government continues to overlook. I refer to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business index, quoted in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 12 October 1994, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40% of small business complaints relate to labour market policies. Overall, 55% of the small business surveyed thought that federal government policies worked against them.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Marsden, the index's economic consultant, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taken together, labour market issues such as federal industrial relations policy, superannuation policy and employee training and concessions now rank with taxation as the largest single factor behind the negative assessment of the Federal Government.</PARA>
<PARA>Small business is reported as being particularly resentful of the termination regulations of the government's industrial relations policies, citing them as a major impediment to hiring labour. Taxation remained at the top of the small business hate list, with 39 per cent of respondents claiming it was to blame for their negative view of the government. The feeling that government did not understand the needs of small business was 24 per cent, compared with 9 per cent in May 1993. Too much bureaucracy was 22 per cent today, compared with 27 per cent in May 1993. Excessive government charges was 17 per cent today, compared with 7 per cent in May 1993. These were also high on the agenda. If these concerns are not addressed, we will never maintain a reduction in the number of unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> recently, 30 November 1994, David McKenzie reported on the most recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business index survey. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The edge has started to come off small business confidence. The latest Yellow Pages small business index survey has found that sales and employment levels among small business grew more slowly than expected during the three months to October.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The net proportion expecting the total economy to improve over the same period was only 30%, a figure which had fallen progressively from the 65% result from the February 1994 survey.</PARA>
<PARA>The possibility of rising interest rates&mdash;and this has been flagged again by the government this week&mdash;let alone tax hikes, will not restore confidence in small business to any great measure. The huge deficit is a significant factor in holding back a rejuvenation of business confidence. The McKinsey report on business investment and regional prosperity released on 30 March 1994 demonstrates how the government's industrial relations laws are damaging the recovery. One business owner stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can name five businesses who are not taking on people because it has become more difficult to sack them if conditions change or they don't work out. I'm the same; I am more conservative now.</PARA>
<PARA>I can certainly back up this quotation with all the anecdotal evidence that I receive from businessmen around Australia and Victoria particularly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second highest ranked impediment to investment was cited as government oncosts, identified as payroll tax, the training guarantee levy, workers compensation and associated compliance costs. It is significant that almost one in three growing businesses said they would hire an additional person if oncosts were lower. I suggest that if every small business in Australia hired one more person tomorrow employment would be reduced to an amazing level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labour market flexibility was also viewed as essential to investment growth. Nowhere does the white paper tackle key issues such as labour costs and restrictive award provisions. Getting rid of unfair dismissal laws, for example, would be one way to give small businesses some incentive to employ people, because the unfair dismissal laws certainly act as a deterrent. There are other factors besides micro-economic reform which could be considered in examining ways to reduce unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child Care as a Factor in Understanding Labour Market Participation</EMPHASIS> presented at the EPAC child care conference, the author, Joan Corbett, gave evidence that strengthened the argument that child care is a prerequisite needed to facilitate the entry of women into the paid work force. Ms Corbett suggested that formal child care services other than preschool are the services most importantly related to women's labour force participation. Deborah Brennan in Moncrieff Cochran 1993 also said that `statistics in hidden unemployment also shows that the absence of affordable child care is one of the major constraints to women actively seeking work'. This government, as I have mentioned in this place before, has been far from effective in providing choice, accessibility or affordability in relation to child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to turn to the case management system, which will be provided under the Employment Services Regulatory Authority. That Joan Kirner, the failed former Victorian premier, has been chosen to head the interim board is evidence that the white paper cannot possibly be serious about offering genuine hope to the victims of the recession. Mrs Kirner's lack of business expertise, let alone the creation of massive unemployment and state debt in Victoria, hardly makes her a credible candidate to head such a board. Given this government's past record in giving jobs to the boys and girls, I suppose we should hardly be surprised that qualifications for this particular job seem not to be a prerequisite.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that ESRA, in its role as an accreditation agency, does not impose tight guidelines on the non-CES providers so that, in effect, they are forced to become near clones of the CES. Such imposition would be contrary to the general spirit of competition. The coalition welcomes the spirit of competition involving the greater involvement of non-Department of Employment, Education and Training agencies, supposing it is competition rather than a very great similarity as previously mentioned. Surveys suggest that as few as 17 per cent of employers make use of the Commonwealth Employment Service and that most job seekers who obtain work find their jobs by means other than the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that some case managers will be working only part time in that capacity. They will be doing a mix of functions, servicing clients in case management and performing other related services in the CES. I hope that each client will get the full attention of a case manager and that case managers with other duties will not find that this distracts them from their clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand also that some clients will be dealt with on a team basis. Again, I hope this does not lead to the wasting of resources as clients get shuffled from one case manager to another. I find it quite appalling that there are currently 82,000 people on a waiting list for services from case managers. I find it quite strange that there are projections for people to be case managed but there are no similar projections for the number of case managers. How does the government know what services should be provided?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that the notice given to each client of the opportunity of an interview will depend on the load of each case manager. Some people will not get notices at all, I am informed, because they will be told when they are in the CES, perhaps being interviewed for another reason. That does not seem to be a particularly good way of getting notification about interviews to people. Some uniformity of procedure might have been desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking into account the number of case managers and the number of unemployed, the load for every case worker works out at approximately 125 clients per year, or about 1.5 working days per client per year. That includes one-on-one discussions between clients and the case officers preparing the activity agreement, arranging program placements, follow-up, and all the associated paperwork. Let us hope that this is sufficient. It hardly seems like a particularly long time in which to help someone who may have been unemployed for two years or longer. Case managers are expected to match employees to employers, but there is still no attempt at tackling the real problem, which is how to allow and encourage businesses to employ more people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, as I said at the start of my remarks, the coalition will not oppose this bill but we have serious doubts about the ability of this government to effectively reduce and maintain a real decline in the number of unemployed. Without real job creation facilitated by micro-economic reform, any number of case managers and training programs will be ineffective. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Madam Acting Deputy President, this legislation is a disappointment. The jobs compact could have been a huge step forward. The fact is that what we have in front of us is not a huge step. It may be painted as such, but it does not achieve it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats started talking about some form of compact between the community, the government and the unemployed back in 1992. We envisaged that a community commitment to the unemployed in the form of a jobs levy, a government commitment in the form of large-scale active employment programs, and an unemployed commitment in the form of a preparedness to have a go were reasonable things to seek in such a program. But when the government went cold on the jobs levy, the thing rapidly deflated, so much so that when I look at these bills I come to the conclusion that the obligations flow pretty much one way. These bills are full of all the things that the unemployed are required to do but the only new commitment from the government is the provision of case managers to make sure that they do them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has pointed to an extra $6.5 billion over four years, but on even a cursory examination that number does not really exist. It is a mirage of funny money. It cannot be described as anything else because the truth is that all the money being spent on the jobs compact is a reshuffling of money that is already being spent in one form or another on labour market programs and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people look carefully at the figures, as we have done, they discover that over the next few years the government will spend less on the unemployed than it did in the last financial year. The jobs compact is a huge public relations win for the government. It sounds good; it projects an image of actually doing something. But, for the unemployed, it means that they have to be prepared to be pushed around a lot harder to receive the same or even less support from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the Senate to look at the figures. When we add up the white paper expenditure on employment related programs&mdash;including training, industry and infrastructure spending&mdash;the government's claim of a $1 billion boost this financial year actually turns out, in real terms, to be a cut of $437 million. That is, in real terms, the government will be spending $437 million less on alleviating unemployment this year than it did last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995-96&mdash;the first full year of the jobs compact, when the government claims it will be costing over $1.7   billion&mdash;the real cost will be a saving to the budget, in real terms, of $1.3 billion, rising to $1.5 billion the following year. On more conservative assumptions, Professor John Piggott of the University of New South Wales predicts a $342 million improvement to the government's fiscal position due to the jobs compact. So it is not only the Democrats who are questioning the figures; we are not the only ones who claim that the government has jiggled these figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the actual jobs? There are not too many jobs coming from the proud package that we have before us today. The vast bulk of subsidised job compact places will come through jobstart and the youth training initiative. On the government's own statistics, 80 to 85 per cent of these subsidised places will come at the expense of unsubsidised workers. According to Professor John Piggott, the jobs compact will create, at best, a net reduction of 50,000 in the number of unemployed. That works out to be one extra job for every 16 Australians who at the moment are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what good will this package really do? I believe that it makes sense every now and then to have a good hard look at what the government is doing in its programs and work out where it could have been done better. To its credit, the government has agreed to do that and has decided that its employment program should be weighted more favourably to the long-term unemployed. This legislation will have the effect of maybe shuffling around that queue a little bit. The hope is that, by doing so, by making the long-term unemployed more employable, we will reduce the rate of unemployment at which full employment, as measured by employers' preparedness to employ, kicks in and pushes up wages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support that general aim, but we are concerned that part of this government's solution is simply redefining `long-term unemployed'. It is quite simple to see through that. If people who are presently defined as long-term unemployed embark upon a training course then, of course, they are no longer long-term unemployed. But are they employed at the end of the training course? That is the question. Senator Troeth raised this matter earlier and I cannot see any reason for changing the direction of her concerns. We agree with her. The question is: at the end of the program, has the person who is no longer long-term unemployed changed into an employed person? While we question that, we do support the general aim of improving the situation of the unemployed, but it is a question of how it is done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the jobs compact should become very much more a genuine compact, a genuine agreement&mdash;I deliberately stress that word `agreement'&mdash;between the government and the unemployed. The obligations must be more reciprocal; more balanced, one to the other. It is our view that the present bill weighs too much against the unemployed person, giving the government and its new policemen, the case managers, too much power. We will be moving amendments in the committee stage to address this imbalance. In particular, we want to make sure that a case management activity agreement is just that: an activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current bill contains some outrageous clauses, one suggesting that the terms of the case management activity agreement are set by the case manager and that a failure to agree to those terms by the unemployed person, a refusal to accept a fait accompli, would lead to immediate loss of benefits. We think that provision is outrageous and we will be seeking to amend it. We also want to look at the outcomes of case management, remembering that a large part of this bill privatises much of the case management function of the CES and that there will be a large payment by results approach to case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about the unemployed being tipped into jobs that do not have a future, just to satisfy the payment by outcomes requirement. Given that many of the jobs they are placed in will attract jobstart subsidies, I would be particularly worried about the employers employing them until the subsidy runs out, then&mdash;having qualified through achieving an outcome&mdash;getting rid of them and seeking another subsidised worker. I realise there are a few impediments to following that course too readily but I suggest that in the real world those impediments are hopped over quite often. We will be moving amendments to require placements to be quality placements and to lead to sustainable long-term employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further issue we will be seeking to address by amendment is the recognition of the wider definition that productive employment, producing something of benefit to Australia, whether social or artistic, need not be paid employment. I thought that by now the government would be aware of a whole subeconomy of unpaid employment in this country. Work performed in the home is a classic example. Voluntary work performed in the community sector is another and the artistic community, in some respects, is a third. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of what employment is is vital to an understanding of what we value as a community. While this bill partly recognises this, in a begrudging sort of way, I do not think it goes far enough in recognising that the nature of employment is changing. We will never again in this country have the situation where everyone who wants a full-time paid job can have one. This bill is the medium through which we should be seeking to encourage and expand the various alternatives. But we do not see leadership in that direction from this bill. We should; but we do not see any notion that this has been seriously considered. In a very limited, traditional and prescriptive way we see the outcomes that the case managers will be paid for. The Democrats will be moving some amendments to seek to achieve a more enlightened and flexible approach in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to note the nasty little swiftie the government has tried to pull in the consequential amendments to this bill. Careful observers and those most directly affected will know that only a few months ago the Democrats successfully moved an amendment to the Social Security Act requiring two payment periods' grace before a breach resulted in benefits being withdrawn. That, we believe, was an equitable amendment which provided some more justice to the system and one which was of considerable assistance to those directly affected. It will avoid the current situation where often the unemployed person does not even know an activity agreement has been breached until the benefits are failed to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in an employment bill, has sought to sneak back into the negative the amendment which was supported by the Democrats and the opposition. We concede that there were some problems with our earlier amendment and there may be some breaches, but this backdoor approach to negativing an amendment by the Senate which achieved a good outcome&mdash;this sneaky backdoor method&mdash;is a bit steep. I am sure we will say a bit more about that in the committee stage. It bears signalling that the government has failed to pull this little stroke at this stage and that we will be making a bit more noise about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to urge the government to ensure that those on a disability support pension have full access to the jobs compact, if they want it, without losing their pension. I understand that the government is looking at a means of ensuring that a pensioner who registers with the CES is automatically fast-tracked into the `at risk' category and given access to case management. I will be seeking an assurance from the minister that that is the case and that there is a mechanism for ensuring that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disabled, if they feel capable of participating in the work force, should be given every assistance. Having said that, if people do not feel capable of participating in the work force they should not be forced to do so. I believe voluntary registration with the CES, tied to fast-track access to case management, could be a good means of achieving that assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, it is readily apparent that this bill will achieve only a tiny proportion of all that which the government hype and the taxpayer funded advertising claim it will. For some categories of long-term unemployed, it carries the potential for great benefit. For that reason, we are treating it seriously and are not being pernickety about particular clauses and phrases. We are looking very generously at the overall thrust of this bill because we recognise the potential for great benefit for some people. But the balance in this bill is not right&mdash;there is no way the government can claim that it is right&mdash;and it is up to the Senate to correct it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to say the reason we are dealing with the Employment Services Bill 1994 is that at this moment there is an attempt being made to usurp the democratic processes of this chamber behind closed doors. The Greens will be supporting this bill because we believe case management has the potential to deal with the complex issues of long-term unemployment. However, we would like to take the opportunity to highlight the innumerable problems associated with the government's proposals for this type of case management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many community concerns and concerns from people who deal with the most disadvantaged people in the labour market that this new move to case management which is outlined in the Employment Services Bill will not help the people who need it the most. Organisations such as Centacare, ACOSS, the Welfare Rights Centre and the Victorian Social Justice Council believe that, although case management and individual treatment may be a valuable concept in principle, the way the government has set up this scheme under the preferred model of case management is too imbued with economic efficiency measures at the expense of quality service which disadvantaged people most need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preferred model of case management that the government has chosen to adopt has a number of inadequacies. It fails to have the flexibility that community service organisations need to implement case management according to their mission goals. It fails to provide funds for case management according to regional need. It has limited regulation of entry of private providers. It fails to recognise the psycho-social aspects of unemployment, and it fails to provide an independent advocacy service for unemployed people receiving case management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message from community service organisations is that they must be allowed to expand on the model of case management set forth by the government that would allow them to provide additional care which is more in line with their mission goals of treating the whole person and not just a part. Those who work with a holistic approach to case management believe that this system proposed by the government is too limited and focused on quantitative and economically defined outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other public service providers feel that, in order to maintain service quality to unemployed people, private providers must be rigorously regulated to ensure that they are always working in the best interests of the unemployed individual. Measures need to be in place to make sure that such organisations are focused on empowering unemployed people to make their own decisions rather than making their decisions for them and therefore increasing corporate profit at the expense of their welfare. In line with this, it would be advisable for the government to consider a code of ethics for ESRA to use as a guide for public and private service providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point about building economic efficiency measures into the management of unemployed people is that it can work at odds with the provision of quality services, which cannot be defined in dollar terms. This is a fundamental problem in this thinking that economic efficiency is the main function of service provision because it instigates competition instead of cooperation. Services will compete for the most employable and work ready for the workplace because those people are the most economically efficient unemployed people to deal with. So economic efficiency measures will enhance the process of creaming where labour market programs constantly cream 20 per cent of the most work ready people out of the labour market and consistently leave those who need assistance, time and care at the bottom of the heap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What will happen is that the private providers will manage the most employable of the unemployed and leave the long-term unemployed with pre-vocational and self-esteem needs, which pre-empt vocational needs, to the community service providers. These organisations work on a different level and are extremely concerned that private providers will be allowed to get away with profiteering behaviour such as creaming referrals, clients being manipulated to take jobs that are unsuitable and skimping on the provision of services. It would therefore be more productive if ESRA takes a role in encouraging cooperation between agencies to stimulate quality service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important that case management be varied by region and that disadvantaged regions lacking support services be taken into consideration for more resources for unemployed people. In terms of the quality of the case managers who are delivering the case management services, we need to make sure they understand the complexities of long-term unemployment and the high expectations placed upon them as case managers. They need to be trained and responsive to the issue of long-term unemployment. They need to be able to provide to their clients social and emotional support with the help of community organisations if they need it. They need to take the time to give post-employment guidance, and they most of all need comprehensive guidelines for assessment of people who are unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also evident that the dual roles of providing support and acting as assessor for the activity test are mutually exclusive and incompatible. Because the case manager will be delivering a service on two contradictory levels, the person who is receiving the service will question the genuine nature of the assistance and will not receive the emotional, psychological and social support he or she needs which requires trust and sharing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, this legislation, in the way in which it is written, takes quite a functional and utilitarian approach to the management of human beings. It denies any other barriers to employment for psycho-social hindrances and therefore makes no effort to address them but deals in terms of skills deficits as if that will solve the world unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, there are many barriers to employment, such as discrimination by employers; disabilities; language and ethnicity; low self-esteem; mental illness; depression; loss of personal power and dignity; poverty; homelessness; and drug and alcohol problems. There is no consideration for the people with these problems who are deeply disadvantaged in the labour market. No softly, softly approach or affirmative action is built into this bill for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that this new system also maintains the myth that unemployed people are either a threat or victims, that they need to be helped as drop-outs or that they are a threat to society and should not interacting in the same activities that mainstream society indulges in. It is interesting to reflect on some of the figures provided by the Victorian Social Justice Council, which says that the limits to the debate about services to the unemployed are well articulated in the government's own figures published in the green paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, following newstart's initiation when there was increased pressure on the unemployed to use CES services, CES secured only 3.1 per cent of all jobs secured by unemployed people. At that time, private agencies secured only 0.6 per cent of successful jobs granted to unemployed people. But the largest percentage figure of the people who secured 38 per cent of jobs secured was gained by so-called `cold canvassing' of employers; that is, by unaided job search of unemployed people themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we can see that much labour market activity can occur without the help of professionals from either the public or the private sector, we must make sure that any new service we bring in to help unemployed people is not at the expense of their doing it themselves and empowering themselves in the process but is not falling back into the old patterns of treating unemployed people as not wanting to work, being lazy, needing assistance or someone to do it for them, et cetera. These are harmful old myths about the unemployed that it is time to discard. If we treat these people as equals, then we may be able to help them rather than hinder them and make them feel resentful of our demands at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will be moving a number of amendments&mdash;that is, if the democratic process of this chamber is not further usurped to stop us from being able to prepare them. These amendments, which we will be moving at the committee stage of the bill, are based on the amendments moved for the youth training allowance. They deal with the negotiating ability of the unemployed person in the case management process and different treatment for those who are deeply disadvantaged in the labour market. The consequential amendments deal with leaving two days pay before a person is cut off from an allowance, which we think is a fairer measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope honourable senators will give these amendments serious consideration at the committee stage of this bill. I hope the government allows the various parties involved time to make sure that this important debate is carried on in the way that is fairest and will give the best hearing to these important issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When progress was reported on Thursday I had begun to speak on amendment 11, which was designed to include technology transfer to the Third World as reasonably responsible of the public in patent law. As in any case under this section of the act, this does not mean that all companies must act in this way. It means only that, if a company does not ensure that there is some provision for technology transfer in line with international agreements to facilitate it, another company can challenge its right to exclusive control and perhaps get a licence to produce the technology to facilitate such transfer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a big thing for the company. It does not say that the company must allow anyone access to its technology without paying. It does not say that the company must allow competition in the open market. All it says is that, if a court decides that technology transfer is an important issue in respect of a certain patent in a certain country and the court decides that the company is not meeting its humanitarian and development assistance duties in respect of the public, the court can order the company to address the situation or allow a licence on the patent for another company to do so. This amendment does not guarantee that the situation in which a company uses patents to prevent development goals held now as a common interest of humanity will be resolved. It simply sets up an option to make some resolution possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of this, we should note that many former colonial nations went through protracted periods where their technology was actively suppressed by their colonial masters. Nations like Britain worked to destroy industries such as the Indian textile industry as well as protecting the British industry through trade barriers. As a consequence of active suppression, including the literal destruction of factories&mdash;not as a consequence of technical productivity&mdash;India, which had been a cloth exporter for centuries, became an importer of British cloth and clothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT was born in part as a consequence of the same forces that gave rise to the United Nations. These were forces in social perspectives borne out of a struggle against militaristic, imperialistic aggression and non-democratic nations. The International Trade Organisation and the United Nations were both designed to break down colonial barriers and foster cooperative development. The UN quickly got bogged down in Cold War polarisation, but the agenda of political decolonisation proceeded. The ITO never got up because of lack of support from the United States, but its original agenda was to break the trade stranglehold the imperial nations had on their colonies and the barriers that the Eurocentric empires had against each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns raised in the ITO was that the commodities fetch proper prices, instead of the distorted prices established to benefit the masters within empires. This move was later echoed in calls in the United Nations by the ex-colonial nations. The use of development and trade, including what is called the strategic trade policy, to support distorted prices has continued to be of concern. The need to remedy this situation was a major plank of the new international economic order&mdash;a policy ratified by the United Nations in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem persisted and was pointed out again by the Brandt report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North/ South</EMPHASIS> and later by the Brundtland report. Another major problem has been, and continues to be, the transfer of technology. Technology transfer was identified as a crucial component of sustainable development. While that term and what it means is contentious, anyone reading <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Common Future</EMPHASIS> should clearly understand that a major aspect of the report was the focus on poverty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brundtland report stated the link between poverty and environmental degradation. Corporate vested interests have made the most of that link, stating that the way to environmental protection is through growth. This is not quite what it said. The report said that poverty and the attempt to rise out of it increasingly resulted in degradation of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the Brandt report, the Brundtland report also noted that development can result in increased environmental destruction and, under laissez-faire market conditions, can and often does result in greater human poverty and suffering. It pointed out that at this point in history environmental degradation occurs on such a scale that the whole planet is affected. It is therefore a situation where humanitarian goals, the goals of bringing all people out of the most desperate poverty, coincide with our common global environmental goals. That is the message of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Common Future</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said in that report that there should be growth. The report said that the growth must be an entirely different sort of growth in which nations work cooperatively to assure social justice, equity and the development of environmentally sound technologies. It said that the need for growth was primarily in the developing nations and primarily to meet human needs. It said over and over that the essential ingredient in this technology transfer is that if growth is to benefit anyone it must be just and equitable growth and must involve meeting needs through the most technically advanced means without destroying the environment. It said that the developing world cannot develop along the exploitative path we have followed, that most advanced technology will be required to allow it to develop along more sustainable pathways and that many new technologies will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report says that developed nations have a role to play as the nations with wealth and that we need education with an industrial base to work on the new technology. It did not say that this was to become a licence to print money&mdash;a new means of exploitation of the South. It did not say that the South should be required to produce an ever increasing volume of primary products and manufactured goods for the North at ever decreasing price. It did not say that the North should agree to lower some of its trade barriers in return for a complete stranglehold on technology through trade related intellectual property regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the report did say is that technology transfer is crucial. It means the best available technology must be available to the developing nations at a price which allows it to be used in an integrated way in all national development. The Brundtland report made that point clearly and the issue has been seen as vital in agenda 21. It is seen as vital in effective action on climate change and other global problems. The TRIPS agreement goes the other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patents and other forms of intellectual property are new ways of ensuring that developing nations cannot develop without assuring someone else a major property. It will grant monopoly control of ideas and technology and exclude the developing world. Developed nations hope they will get advantages out of this, through having companies patent and produce high-tech goods in their nations. They hope this corporate monopoly on technology will benefit them at the expense of the developing world. Perhaps it will, although this is not certain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certain that it is not likely to benefit the developing world. One of the things that developing countries have been able to do in the past is simply use what they cannot pay for. Nations like India and China have simply used ideas and technology as well as they could in their efforts to develop. If they needed a medicine which was too expensive and a company would not make it or sell it in the country then, if possible, they made it themselves. If their balance of trade would be thrown out completely by the need to import basic technologies and companies would not set up plants, developing nations set them up and allowed them to be set up regardless of patents and licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has not resulted in huge unfair international competition. The goods are rarely exported successfully, unless to other developing nations willing to ignore intellectual property. It may have resulted in unfair domestic competition within these developing nations, depending on how one defines fair. It has resulted in medicines and goods being available much more cheaply in the developing world. Anyone need only visit a pharmacy in India to see that virtually everything from aspirin and medicine to antibiotics is much less expensive&mdash;often a tenth or less of the cost in our pharmacies, in spite of the subsidies government here pays on medicines to assure their availability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only needs to look at the cost of most anything from car parts to movies to stainless steel pressure cookers to understand that things can be made, distributed and sold much more cheaply than they are in the north. Looking at Indian prices was, for many years, a good gauge of the profit margins companies put on their goods. Admittedly, the quality of medicine in India is not as high as in Australia. We can afford more quality than it can, but is the qualitative improvement really 10 or 20 times better? How much price increase is justified for that qualitative improvement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is not about the price of Australian goods. It is about the price of medicine and other goods in Africa, India and other developing nations. It is an issue of whether it should be an Indian government or a corporate board room in Brazil which decides what quality of medicine at what price will be available in Indian markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the willingness of developing nations to ignore patents and other intellectual property when corporate interest conflicted with national interests is that corporations found themselves in a position where, to get anything, they had to deal. Many companies did deal, setting up for inexpensive domestic production in developing nations or granting licence for inexpensive, non-export oriented production. In a similar way, copyright holders granted concessional licence on books and recordings as an alternative to seeing their works simply pirated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What TRIPS seeks to do is eliminate this negotiating power of developing nations. In aggressively pursuing intellectual property, what is happening is that developing nations will be put under threat of cross-sectional sanctions against their exports by nations representing corporate patent holders. Corporations can then make market decisions not to produce in a developing nation, not to produce to their lowest standards and not to grant any concessional access through lower prices or licence arrangements. The developing nations are allowed to sell goods to the former colonial masters in return for granting foreigners and transnational companies on restricted access to come and buy, to control resources, to produce and to export the goods, assets and profits. These nations can also hope that companies might choose them for a site and improve the balance of trade figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">TRIPS has another unfortunate effect for developing nations. We have seen in situations such as the erythromycin patent I mentioned the other day that researchers in developing nations can be effectively robbed of any return on their work. This is not unusual. In addition to the exploitative treatment of actual employees or researchers, we see a situation where, under various aid or development programs, northern researchers may work alongside researchers from a developing nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These southern researchers have usually been through a university of the nation concerned, or they may have either studied abroad or done additional work at a northern university. Yet, almost always, there is a vast differential in pay, although there may be little or no differential in work or talent. It may be weighted on the side of the southern researcher. This frequently carries through in terms of credit given to the intellectual property claims, meaning that the patent goes to the north and the south is excluded. Southern nations and nationals have little effective opportunity to challenge such situations legally in northern courts. Even where a developing nation company discovers or develops a product itself, it is possible it may not be able to effectively press for intellectual patents before some transnational patents the idea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current patent laws we are seeing a whole new realm of exploitation and distortion. The biotechnology and biochemical substances area is the biggest growth area in intellectual property. We now see companies often assisted under `sustainable development' programs to catalogue or investigate biological researchers for conservation, claiming this knowledge as intellectual property. We also see patents granted on naturally occurring biochemicals and/or the genes regulating them and granted on the basis of specific search. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a new class of patents based on the principle that in biotechnology the value is in knowing and that the innovative step is knowing what to look for and doing the work to look. This kind of patent is not universally accepted, although the United States and a number of nations are increasingly open to accept such patent claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An upshot of this sort of claim is that a company can send a researcher to India to look at traditional medicine and agricultural practices using plants or other biological agents. If that northern researcher does some experiment which indicates that the traditional use works, if the researcher does a chemical analysis of the active agent or even if that person takes a cell line of the biological organism concerned, the company can patent this on the basis of specific search. As a consequence, we now see patents being taken out on practices such as the use of neem as a pesticide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neem is an Indian tree that has been traditionally used for centuries. It is known in India as a powerful insecticide and it has been used in that way. Indian farmers developed presses to extract neem oil and use it on their plants. The technology is common in India and Nepal and is promoted heavily as an alternative to commercial chemical inputs. It has recently been patented and is now being marketed and developed in the developing world. I recently saw on TV an advertisement which related to this technology. There has been no recognition granted to the farmers who, through centuries of observation and experimentation, developed the substance that is used for that purpose. Moreover, a patent can be used to block any attempt by India to develop neem as a product and export it or get some return on what is basically a stolen traditional technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a huge range of issues in the current way intellectual property is being granted and used. International attempts to examine this have been effectively overridden by the acceptance of TRIPS. Most of the intellectual property push has had a regressive effect on southern development, yet we want to expand these property rights without question. I call upon honourable senators to support our amendment. It is not much, but it at least recognises the need for some provision for technology transfer to counteract the effect of intellectual property regimes. It at least provides an option that might be used. </PARA>

<PARA>Here we have tried to ensure that recourse to the provisions for meeting the reasonable requirements of the public found in section 135 is available to the general public. We have tried to include among these reasonable requirements an assurance that the actual innovators would benefit, that technology transfer would be supported in line with international agreements. The government in its amendments has sought to define exactly the conditions under which these reasonable requirements can be pressed, although we feel that the way it has done so has weakened the provisions. Unfortunately, while sections 133, 134 and 135 work to protect the public, section 136 counteracts this. Section 136 says, in effect, that any international agreement can override the public good. This is a situation of great concern and we see the extension of patent powers under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should never be the case that we sign an international agreement that would override reasonable public interests. Even though the Senate does not support our call to assure that the ambassador to the World Trade Organisation does not argue against Australian law in a way that is counter to the desires of parliament, I believe that there is room for a specific call that in no case should an ambassador agree to a measure that would eclipse reasonable public requirements for patent holders as embodied in section 135. This is not a big thing and the requirements are not onerous, yet the current section 136 sets the stage for such public interest to be eclipsed. Trade related intellectual property under the World Trade Organisation is the vehicle that would accomplish it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate amendment seeks to reverse this situation. It deletes the existing section and replaces it with a section stating that negotiators on patent should not sign any agreement which would override reasonable requirements of the public. These rights are essential in maintaining some guarantee of public benefit from patents. The amendment goes further and states that, on basic public interest grounds, negotiators should be striving to incorporate similar reasonable requirements of the public provisions in international treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this debate, I have highlighted several problems in relation to patents. I know that the Australian Democrats and Senator Harradine share many of the Greens' concerns and have said so here. That the two major parties seem neither to have concerns nor to recognise any concerns does not seem to reflect public sentiment, academic opinion or international issues in relation to global economic and social change. The requirements of section 135 are simple. They are designed to prevent the worst abuses of granting monopoly control over technology. Such abuses may not be a problem for corporations that hold the patents but they are a problem for any other corporation, small companies and individual innovators, and they definitely pose a problem for society, the public and the people who they are charged to represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a means of ensuring there is some recourse where abuse of monopoly power occurs, the measures here should be promoted and promoted strongly in international negotiations. There would be fewer problems for people accepting the benefits of TRIPS or other regimes if there were some clear mechanism for integrating social concerns. Instead, we have means of overriding them and Senator McMullan cannot understand why people are presently concerned about this. I ask senators to support this amendment. It is simple and responsible to both Australia and a wider social constituency. There is nothing protectionist in this except that it seeks to protect society from abuses of monopoly power. This cannot be a bad thing and is entirely on side with a desire to see healthy competition consistent with granting recognition for development work done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also point out to the Senate that, in spite of the large number of researchers of a high calibre in Australia and the innovations that have come from this country, Australia has traditionally been very poor at developing these innovations. Patents, or effective patent control, have all too often gone overseas. As a consequence, Australia is frequently not one of the first nations to benefit from the innovation that occurs here. We remain a small and distant market globally, which may not be worth developing in early stages of production. In such a situation, some protection against the monopoly control granted to companies overseas is all the more important, and the interest of Australian innovators is not served by suppressing public interest. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts's amendment is similar in approach to some amendments she has moved previously which the Australian Democrats have supported on the basis that the public interest must be taken into account by our negotiators and that this parliament has a right to set the standards and the policies which should be followed by our negotiators. I will not take time to address this particular amendment any further. I am as conscious as the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) is of the time constraints that we all operate under. However, these bills are important and I wish to rectify very briefly&mdash;in no more than three minutes&mdash;some comments that the minister made last week and during the weekend.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not approach these bills in an obstructionist way. Further, we are prepared to concede that the minister has some personal concern about the outcome of these bills. Unfortunately, the way in which these bills were introduced and the content of some of them do not appear to reflect adequately the personal concern that the minister has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point I want to make is that it is important for the health of public debate in this country that the other side of the trade deregulation debate gets an airing. There are losses as well as gains from trade and these should be stated. We do welcome the estimated $4 billion in benefits to Australia from the WTO agreement; in particular, the gains to many of our primary producers. However, we do have questions about the price tag on these benefits. This price tag includes both considerable collateral damage and some very real questions about Australia's sovereignty&mdash;questions which the coalition has been raising for months with respect to other treaties but it seems to be selectively remaining silent with regard to the WTO agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me state quite categorically that the minister is not the only one who has done high school economics. I am quite familiar with Ricardo's model of the gains from trade. Trade analysis did not, however, stop in the 19th century. We have had since then Professor Robert Reich, Professor Hermann Daly, Professor Paul Romer, Susan George, `Nugget' Coombs, Ted Traynor, Ernst Rodeck, John Kain, and many others who have provided critiques of a simplistic acceptance of the neo-classical trade model, each from a somewhat different perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the minister's views to the contrary, it is entirely appropriate that such alternative views are aired in this chamber and are not pushed aside. At a time when the government and the opposition are adopting almost identical ideological stances, it is important for the health of public debate in this country that we do put this other position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said one other thing on Friday. He argued that the `race to the bottom' was a myth. He cited Burma, Bangladesh, Nepal and Singapore. I say to the minister that he does not need to look to such obscure places to see evidence of the race to the bottom. All the evidence he needs is right here in Australia. The race to the bottom says that unconstrained international competitive pressures will lead to reductions in wages, in working conditions and in environmental standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to wages, I suggest to the minister that he should look at the Industry Commission report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Impediments to regional industry adjustment</EMPHASIS>. This report looks at the problems faced by some regions in Australia caused by the internationalisation of the Australian economy. What is the solution proposed for the unemployment that has been caused? `Labour market flexibility'&mdash;in other words, lower wages. The Industry Commission says that solving unemployment in regional Australia caused by trade deregulation is to have `low wage' regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to working conditions, I suggest that the minister should look at a series of articles by Paul Heinrichs in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> earlier this year. Those articles describe sweatshop working conditions among garment industry outworkers in Melbourne&mdash;that is Melbourne, Australia, not Melbourne, Bangladesh. Those conditions arose because garment retailers, facing increased competition from cheap imports based on exploited labour, told their suppliers that they had to supply at lower cost, or else. The only way those suppliers could meet those cost levels was to subcontract the work to immigrant workers working under the most appalling conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to environmental standards, we do not have to look any further than the comments by the then minister for the environment in this chamber earlier this year. In telling us why the government had not moved on implementing measures to achieve Australia's greenhouse commitments, we were told that Australia was not going to do anything which damaged the `international competitiveness' of our industry. So there we have it: pressures to cut wages, appalling working conditions and reduced environmental standards, all directly attributable to trade deregulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not be so quick to point to the newly industrialising countries as great examples of the benefits of trade deregulation. As Dr Walden Bello pointed out on his recent visit to Australia, Thailand is starting to show the downside of the internationalisation of its economy. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 17 per cent of the country remains forested. . . To the crisis of the forests has now been added a crisis of industrial pollution, as waste-water, air quality and industrial safety regulations lie largely unenforced in order to attract foreign investors. The lower reaches of the mighty Chao Phraya River running through Bangkok, on the banks of which thousands of factories are located, are biologically dead. Traffic strangles Bangkok, where 600 new cars hit the road everyday. Workers in electronics factories in one industrial estate are mysteriously dying and many suspect that this is due to poisoning from substances they come into contact with in the work place.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister may argue that the gains from trade deregulation outweigh the pain. That is a legitimate position, and he may prove, in the long run, to be right. I hope so, but the simplistic view that there is no race to the bottom flies in the face of too much evidence to be allowed to go unchallenged. I am sure the minister himself would argue that the decision to enter the WTO is a momentous one for Australia. I cannot understand, therefore, why he dismisses serious debate about the issues as obstructionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second set of issues I want to raise concerns the price tag of the WTO agreement. I repeat: the Australian Democrats welcome the benefits from the agreement, but the minister comes in here with legislation and tells us, `I am sorry, but to get these benefits you have to pass bills which are going to ruin the lives of hundreds of battling citrus growers, not to mention a few video game and CD rental shops. We are also going to hurt some pork and egg producers, but you don't even get to see any legislation about those people.' In these circumstances, it is legitimate to ask: is this a price we have to pay? Should there be safeguards? Should there be  changes? Should there be side agreements on social, economic and environmental issues?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, our citrus growers are efficient, yet they will be affected by this legislation to the extent that hundreds, possibly thousands, of small citrus growers will have to leave their holdings. I am sure that the minister has concern for those losers. I am sure that his advisers have convinced him that there is nothing we can do for the various losers out of the WTO agreement that is `legal' under the WTO rules, but we are not convinced. The minister cannot expect to bring such legislation in here without questions being asked. Simple fairness demands that someone stands up for the people whose lives are being ruined, and it is a pity that the coalition does not have the guts to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also been dismissive of our concerns about sovereignty, which are at the heart of this argument. He says that, since we now have the opportunity to vote on these bills, democracy is at work. The way these bills have been brought before us is certainly not a good example of a democratic process at work. No reason has been given for any of these bills except that it is necessary to pass them in order to sign on to the WTO agreement. Was there any domestic policy reason why Australia needed to change its sales tax regime and put growers off their land? Is there a domestic policy reason to change our patent law, our trademarks law, our copyright law and our anti-dumping law? No; all we are told is, `Pass these bills or you will lose $4 billion for Australia.' Some would call that blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we welcome the $4 billion, we ask: what effort has been made to change the price that we have to pay? What will happen in the future? Every time our masters at the WTO issue a new instruction, the minister will come rushing in here with a new piece of legislation. Each time we will be told, `Pass these bills or you will lose $4 billion for Australia.' I do not think it is unreasonable for the Senate to baulk at that. If the coalition really believed its own rhetoric about the impact of overseas treaties and Australia's sovereignty, it would also baulk on this bill. All we are asking is that the parliament should have had some say earlier in the process. We do not want our negotiators to agree to things which have important implications for Australia without the parliament being consulted. We do not want to be presented with a fait accompli. We do not want to look at legislation with a gun to our head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister should give us a commitment that he will not come in here again with legislation based on international commitments on which the parliament has had no say and tell us, `Pass it or else we'll get kicked out of the WTO.' These are serious issues. If any bills ever deserved more serious consideration, it is these bills. To debate them is not obstructionism; it is democracy at work. </PARA>

Mind you, it withdraws at a cost. It is not one of those agreements where we are bound for ever and a day. That is part of the material which the coalition has had to consider in looking at this bill, the agreement and the position on sovereignty.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is not an amendment in the true sense of the word. I will be voting against clauses 9 and 10. Clauses 9 and 10 concern the reversal of the onus of proof. Until now, Australia has followed the principle that someone charged is innocent until proven guilty. The government amendment would reverse that. The defendant is now to be considered guilty until proven innocent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In law the onus of proof is of no consequence in two situations. When a person is clearly and provably guilty, that person is not innocent until proven guilty; he or she will be found guilty anyway. When a person is clearly and provably innocent, the onus of proof does not matter; that person can and will be found innocent. The problem arises when the situation is not clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where there is doubt, what we assume about guilt or innocence makes an immense difference. If we assume innocence, in all doubtful cases that cannot be clarified the defendant must be found innocent. If we assume guilt, in all cases where there is any question of guilt, any shadow of a doubt that the defendant might be guilty, the defendant must be found guilty. Consider that for a moment. Even if the defendant seems, on balance, to be innocent, if a shadow of doubt can be cast, he or she must under law be found guilty. That is what this reversal of onus of proof means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This makes the things immensely more difficult for anyone challenged under patent law. It becomes almost impossible to defend oneself, because the situation is frequently far from clear. The way patents are being extended to include things that have never been patentable in the past makes things less clear. The United States National Institute of Health patented application on 7,000 pieces of human DNA includes all the unknown genes and unknown gene products. That makes things less clear. The grant of patents to Agracetus&mdash;a subsidiary of A.G. Grace&mdash;on cotton, peanuts, soybeans and all future developments to these crops makes things less clear. Granting a patent on the genes of a disease makes things less clear because of the implications it has for developing cures for that disease. The difference in real terms between granting patents on human gene lines of DNA and granting patents on people makes things less clear, yet we would drastically extend patent rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not be under any illusions. This is a huge extension of patent rights. To reverse the onus of proof is a far bigger extension of monopoly rights than simply changing the period from 16 to 20 years. It will effectively stop many companies from considering working on some problems&mdash;specifically, health problems and diseases. Already promising developments for cures to diseases have been abandoned after someone with a gene patent sued. The disease research was not done using the proprietary knowledge of the company suing, yet it could sue. Suits are expensive and time consuming, throwing the viability of the entire program into doubt until they are resolved. Resolution may involve more than one appeal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Simply put, it is not worth investigating a cure for a disease in such circumstances, since any work done may gain nothing but massive legal bills and the loss of the work itself. Where the onus of proof is reversed, the situation will become almost impossible. It is clear&mdash;or should be clear at this moment&mdash;that the extension of intellectual property rights under TRIPS has very little to do with ensuring that effort is rewarded; it has to do with control, and that control is more likely to suppress innovation than to encourage it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is likely to restrict a technological advance rather than promote it. It is liable to make it so expensive that for many people it can be simply unavailable. This is what is being promoted here&mdash;suppression of technology, of innovation, especially in relation to medicine and disease prevention due to the push to patent by biotech companies and the human genome people. It is very sad that Senator Coulter is ill at this stage and is not able to be part of this debate. I know that on a number of occasions Senator Coulter has spoken up strongly about his concerns for these particular issues. </PARA>

There are stringent requirements for establishing what can, for simplification of debate, be called a prima facie case on behalf of the plaintiff.

<PARA>We do not plan to call a division on amendment No. 1, but I have some general comments to make. My understanding is that we will then proceed to consider amendments Nos. 2 and 4 together. I will seek leave for that at the time. There will be a division called on them and also on amendment No. 3 that the Greens are presenting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens' amendment No. 1 has been moved to each of the bills we have considered in this World Trade Organisation bill debate. I want to raise again the issue of sovereignty in relation to the Customs Legislation (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994. During the debate over the last few days the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) has publicly characterised the Greens as obstructionist for insisting that these eight bills be actually debated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise that the government and the Liberal Party do not question anything in the bills, no matter what changes may result and no matter who falls victim to those changes. I also acknowledge that the Liberal Party rhetoric on sovereignty does not appear to apply to agreements that will help big transnational corporations and give them more power. The agreements we are making can override federal, state and local laws. They do not seem to care, by the way they have objected to, for example, national treaties. The proposition seems to be that, if it is good for General Motors, Mitsubishi, Daewoo, Unilever, Roche or Royal Dutch Shell, it must be good for Australia. We need to place on the public record that that is not what the Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats agree with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister insists that there is no problem with sovereignty. He says that Australia can do anything it wants legally and take the consequences. We feel that that choice is about as independent as putting a gun to someone's head and telling them, `Give me all your money or I'll shoot.' We believe it is coercive. That there is some implication of choice is an illusion. We have to accept what is happening and take the consequences. So any choice made with a gun at one's head&mdash;whether it is to empty their pockets, give a donation or accept the consequences&mdash;is, in our view, a comparative example of the degree of sovereignty we have as we push these bills through this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens understand that the government and opposition want trade without tariff barriers. If that is the case, there is no problem with our amendment. A resolution from both houses should not be difficult to get on with liberalising trade. Such a resolution would allow our ambassador to pursue that goal without requiring unilateral and pre-emptive dropping of the few trade barriers we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There might be problems where an Australian negotiator is strongly pushing for something, like the reversal of the onus of proof we have just discussed in the previous bill or fighting against discrimination, supporting local investment in areas where there is some provision for local control. There might be problems where an Australian ambassador is fighting to prevent the inclusion of environmental regulation of trade or fighting against a social clause. The government may not have a problem there either, but it would have to put that on the table and the opposition would need to support it openly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know there is a trade and environment subcommittee to the World Trade Organisation meeting to consider whether the WTO should make any regulations on these issues, but we do not know what position Mr Kenyon or his staff take in this committee. From the minister's periodic statements in the press, I understand that he does not believe the WTO is an appropriate forum for including environmental regulation or for including a social clause looking at labour rights, rights to take action against products of child labour and so on. He believes that these should be handled by the ILO or someone. I believe he has expressed himself quite strongly against these issues being included in the WTO. Does this translate into directions to Mr Kenyon? Does the minister leave Mr Kenyon to his own devices on this issue? Is Mr Kenyon directed to take an opposite view to the one the minister expresses?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister claims we are being obstructionist. In the history of the Senate, this must be one of the fastest times for eight important and contentious bills to go from the second reading stage to passage. We may have passed others more quickly, but they certainly did not have the enormous ramifications that these bills have. I am certain that the minister is completely aware that, if the Greens really wanted to be obstructionist, we could use a number of methods at our disposal for delaying the bills. So we take exception to the public remarks that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is of vital importance. The fact is that, in relation to the numbers at the moment, whilst there may be what the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) chooses to call an unholy alliance between the Greens and the opposition, I think he would also have to say there is an unholy alliance between the government and the opposition to push through legislation. Even though the Greens and the Democrats do not have the numbers, we still have a right democratically to express our views. We are doing that in relation to each point that arises, and that is an appropriate position. It is not appropriate that bills are being rushed through without these points receiving even the least mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved a number of amendments to the bills. They are amendments of substance dealing with actual issues relating to the bills. The more general amendments are the ones we put to each bill to call for some accountability to parliament in a process which can establish regulations to which Australian law must conform or Australia faces the consequences. Putting amendments of substance&mdash;amendments, further, which have attracted support of others in this place&mdash;is not obstruction. It is responsible parliamentary process. I also note for the record that virtually all our amendments, like our citrus amendment, are World Trade Organisation consistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the minister appears to have problems with is the idea that any discussion or debate at all should occur on these bills. The minister obviously resents having to be physically present in this place. It seems that that resentment means that nobody should question what the government is doing. This is hidden under the rhetorical device of attacks on the person, ad hominem attacks, stating that any question is a sign of self-righteous people who think they have cornered the market on wisdom. We are presenting a legitimate point of view&mdash;one which, sadly, is not receiving the attention and the debate across the chamber that it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Party and the opposition have been silent on some of these very legitimate questions that they themselves must be concerned about. Also, I am sure there are members in the government who feel that, if they had the capacity to speak out rather than being put into the usual bloc vote and bloc response to the legislation, they would want some of these matters debated and the implications of them drawn out a little more seriously by the government rather than simply by the minor parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These bills are getting minimal attention. The ANL and sports grants get more attention than our joining the World Trade Organisation, which, as the minister says, is one of the most significant steps Australia has ever taken. It is not a considered step. It may have been considered by the ministry and by cabinet, but there has been no broad public consideration and no parliamentary consideration worthy of the name. This is it; this is the whole debate on the World Trade Organisation in the context of these bills&mdash;Thursday evening and Monday morning&mdash;not an excessive amount of time and not obstructionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other countries have indicated the serious concern within their population about the passage of these bills. I think Australia is doing a disservice to its community for not registering the same kinds of concerns about the implications. It implies that none of the unintended consequences that may result from these bills are of any concern or import, not only to the government but also to the opposition in the Liberal Party dimension. The only value I can imagine the government is getting from such calls is by saying we are making cheap political points. But I think the government must accept that it is not possible for members in this chamber to be silent and simply let these bills go through without comment. </PARA>

We have already heard statements from some here that they do not like what is being done but will vote to pass it because they must for the sake of the WTO. I have excluded the National Party from my earlier comments about unqualified support, because I believe the Nationals would have supported some amendments that have been put had there not been the pressure of the coalition party room and the pressure to pass these bills for the sake of the WTO in any case. </PARA>

I ask my colleagues to consider realistically exactly what issues would not receive joint house support and consider whether those are the issues that they wish no input into. As I said, the acceptance of this amendment will be depend on the voices, but the Greens express very strongly our desire that this amendment be accepted as a way of increasing the accountability of any Commonwealth representative in or before the WTO. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There seems to be a serious problem in the current legislation which the Senate attempted to remedy before; that is, there is no direct access to anti-dumping procedures by producers, the growers, whose goods are included as the basis for food products. As I understand it and as was explained in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, which looked at these bills, the growers of something like tomatoes need to go to a producer of the food product, tomato sauce or paste, and get that producer to take up an anti-dumping case. This amendment is designed to ensure direct access to anti-dumping by growers whose produce goes into a product that is dumped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue at stake is that many growers feel that their industry is endangered because of dumping, but for the producers of the food product to take up the issue might mean that they would have to complain against the retailer who is also their customer and who is also the importer. What we see here is a consequence of the concentration of power. The value for corporations appears to be increasingly shifting to marketing. Those who control the wholesaling and retailing operations exercise effective control. They set prices both to the consumer and to the producer. Increasingly, companies are doing what Pacific Dunlop has done. It has shed its canning operations and played two or three canneries off against each other. Pacific Dunlop can then effectively use its marketing position and identity. </PARA>

Companies such as Safeway, a dominant supermarket chain, have moved to integrate production and produce vegetables on its own farms in Mexico. This is used to put pressure on United States producers. Safeway, in producing for itself, importing and then going all the way to retail sales, can take advantage of cheap Mexican labour while assigning any price it wishes to imported goods. This allows an abundant field for manipulation in relation to taxes and would allow an effective circumvention of anti-dumping provisions. It is for that reason that we have moved this amendment. I would welcome comments from the minister as to whether there are some good reasons why this amendment should not be supported. </PARA>

<PARA>In the context of the accountability of the World Trade Organisation ambassador, I raise the entire issue of computer software. The granting of copyright on computer programs, in spite of what has been done, is a very strange and contentious area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, computer programs follow a pattern that is more typical of industrial innovations rather than literary works, although some exceptions may be made for games. However, a program is really more of a tool. It generally has a short lifespan. Arguments about the look and feel of the program are more akin to product design than literature, since no playwrights or authors of whom I know have ever accused another of imitating their emotional tone, theoretical set or typeface and layout of their play or book. It is also highly questionable whether there is any point in providing a copyright with 50 years of control for a computer program. Computer programs tend to have a far shorter lifespan than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that some unresolved issues relating to the treatment of computer software will become more difficult as time goes by.

It is amazing and tragic that, whilst they and many people have refused to give these issues the coverage they deserve, they are today&mdash;the day the changes are trying to be pushed through with undue haste&mdash;talking about the implications for them. However, we will move this amendment for each bill. I commend it to the house.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2Clause 3, page 3, proposed paragraph 30A(2)(a), lines 11 and 12, omit "it will or may be returned", substitute "it will be returned".</PARA>
<PARA>The problem with the bill as it stands is that previously legitimate business operators involved in CD rentals will be driven out of business. The amendments attempt to delete the words `or may' from paragraphs (1)(a) and (2)(a) of proposed new section 30A of the act. In substance they attempt to weaken the sale and buyback prohibition of the bill. The new section 30A, to be inserted by clause 3 of the bill, defines commercial rental arrangement as an arrangement under which a copy of the sound recording or computer program is made available either on terms that it will or may be returned in the course of the conduct of a business and for payment or as part of a service for which payment is to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is attempting by its provisions to capture sale and buyback procedures through the bill. If you cannot rent a CD to someone for $1 for one night you enter into an agreement to sell it to that person for $10 today if he agrees to sell it back for $9 tomorrow. I understand that this is a fair prohibition. However, it is another thing to stop totally a general offer to buy back which would catch in effect all second-hand transactions. We believe that by deleting the `or may' we are arguing that an arrangement is only a rental arrangement if there is an obligation on the part of the purchaser to return it. Otherwise, as I have said, any second-hand dealer who buys and sells would be caught by the legislation. Given that conversion into second-hand stores may be the only option for CD rental operators being driven out of business as a result of this bill, we believe that the deletion of `or may' is important for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall the minister actually evincing some sympathy for the argument that rental of CDs should continue to be available. The arguments were that it was not possible; that under the GATT provisions seeing that we have not made any arrangements prior to this legislation and prior to our agreeing to the WTO agreement we cannot help CD rental operators or consumers. That is probably the most important argument&mdash;that we are closing an avenue for consumers to obtain CDs on a rental basis. However, it would be appropriate, in view of the in-principle stance taken by the minister, to leave open this possibility, which will enable people to continue to obtain compact discs on a rental basis. We do support the right of performers to get just rewards for dealings in their work but, by not making provision for such a scheme prior to our agreeing to the GATT provisions, the government has unfortunately closed off that option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we need to be conscious of the fact that there are 400 businesses across Australia which rent out compact discs. Granting to the copyright owning companies an exclusive right to enter into commercial rental agreements will make the activities of these businesses illegal unless the companies holding the copyright agree to such an arrangement. However, we have on record the developments overseas that, wherever this has happened, the rental operations have not been agreed to by the copyright owning companies. I believe that the government, in acceding to these two amendments, will have an opportunity to enable the rental operators in substance to continue and to enable consumers to continue to take advantage of these arrangements if they cannot afford to buy CDs at the ruling high prices. I commend the amendments to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major purpose of the Copyright (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 seems to be to eliminate the rental music and computer software industry. However, it goes well beyond that. I have pleasure in supporting Senator Spindler's amendments. People may note that they have the same wording as do our amendments Nos 2 and 3, so we obviously both feel strongly about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments the government wants define a commercial rental arrangement as any situation where an item `is made available by a person on terms that it will or may be returned by a person'. By inserting the phrase `or may' into this legislation, it steps beyond something that is a rental agency to cover even second-hand stores. How many second-hand stores or pawnshops have old tapes and records for sale? Most of the ones I have seen do. Even many flea market stalls have such things for sale. They will sell people records. They may buy them back at some time in the future. They are in business&mdash;they buy and sell&mdash;but they are not in the business of renting records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet this legislation would declare this to be a rental arrangement unless these businesses make explicit provision never to repurchase a recording or program. How could this be policed? It is ludicrous. It is poorly thought out and poorly drafted legislation. Perhaps it is a mistake brought on by a government anxious to give industry 150 per cent protection, but it is overkill. As a consequence, we will support those amendments of Senator Spindler which are the same as our amendments Nos 2 and 3 to ensure that incidental possibility of repurchase is not covered in the definition. There is no reason for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the legislation is sufficiently clear to allow companies that operate a commercial sell and re-purchase business to define that operation as a rental arrangement for the purpose of the act. `However the arrangement is expressed'&mdash;that is the quote from the bill&mdash;seems strong enough for me. Proposed new subsection 30A(4) appears to make it clear that such sell and re-purchase can be interpreted as rental. So why is the government so anxious to pursue this? It is very difficult to know. Perhaps the Minister for Trade (Senator McMullan) could answer us this. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key problem for the government with this proposal is that it amounts to a circumvention of that with which we have agreed. On the face of it, that sounds pretty clever&mdash;here is a way we can get around an agreement we have entered into. But most importantly we are pursuing, bilaterally and through the Cairns Group, to prevent people who have been dragged screaming into an agreement about agriculture&mdash;which is overwhelmingly in Australia's interest and, I think, also in the global interest&mdash;coming up with proposals which circumvent the intention of the agree ment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not seem to me to be either proper to be seeking so to do, or very smart, when what it does is arm those who would wish to take action to circumvent the agreements which we, as a result of our efforts with others, have gained and which we wish to see enforced.

As I said before, the minister said during the committee stage that he was not unsympathetic to the problem of rental stores being put out of business and, more particularly, consumers being prevented from taking that particular avenue. He was asked whether he would consider incentives. What term of the agreement that he has made&mdash;he seems to be saying in the spirit of the agreement or undertakings the government has made&mdash;would prevent the government from leaving the possibility of rental being continued? The other question is: would the government be open to an amendment which gave copyright owners an incentive by, say, making the income from rental royalties tax free?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that I understood Senator Spindler's first question. Within the foreseeable future, I do not see us entering into agreements that would allow this rental to take place without the consent of the owner of the intellectual property, any more than one can rent something that belongs to someone else, in the physical property sense. Obviously, one cannot, and this is an extension of that principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to incentives, during the committee consideration of the legislation Senator Spindler asked whether I would look at a proposal that might provide some incentive to copyright owners to agree to rental. I said then that if he wants to put up a proposal I would look at it. He would know from our past debates on other matters that I am not sympathetic to fiddling with the tax system. I have a general view that income is income, and people ought to pay tax on it however they get it. So I do not think that is a valid proposal. If, over time, someone comes forward with a proposal that operates as some sort of incentive, I remain prepared to look at it. But I do not think that is where we should start. </PARA>

<PARA>The government's anxiety to push copyright protection as far as possible has led us to what we feel is some uncertainty, and that is what we are trying to clear up in this amendment. Proposed subsection 5 is put forward explicitly to ensure that public libraries and educational institutions are not considered commercial rental institutions. We believe it is important to put that beyond doubt. This should never be a threat to such institutions freely buying and lending recordings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Proposed subsections 6 and 7 assure that the purchase and resale of goods by second-hand shops are specifically protected. The amendment defines non-conditional resale as a sale of a used good without any expectation that it will be repurchased. It may be repurchased, but there is no condition set up to attempt to assure repurchase. Without this, it is impossible that a person could buy a used record and sell to another used record shop. But, if she or he resold to the record shop from which the person bought the record, that shop might be considered a rental shop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that shops that are buying and reselling on an arms-length basis should not be penalised even where people come back to the same shop. But this right is eroded. It is a short step to acting to close down used book shops and antiquarian book sellers. This amendment will protect those who currently operate used recording shops and rare recording shops. There are a number of these. They are not the same as rental shops, and no confusion should be allowed to exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not understandable why government would insist on pushing for greater and greater extension of the power of recording companies. These are highly concentrated industries represented by a handful of global marketers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the minister to the release today of the names of the six participants in the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research 1995 national outlook conference who were disinvited as a result of the minister's intervention in the conference plans after they were finalised. I ask: why did he wait until this time to intervene? Is it not the fact that two of the speakers were simply replaced on the agenda by people likely to be less critical of the government and the department's policies, and that among the four other disinvited participants were prominent critics of the government's asylum seeker and detention policies? Finally, is this not just another example of this minister's intolerance of differences of opinion or criticism?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3858" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset that Senator Short should know better than to ask this question. On Friday he participated in the Senate estimates committee where it was made very clear in evidence that the director of the Bureau of Immigration and Population Research came to me with his staff and basically said, `You're the minister. We're going to consult with you in the program. We are part of your department. We want your advice on the program and on personnel to be part of the program.' That is the starting point. They recognised the relationship between me and them. They came to me for advice. I was invited to give input as to the program and participants. We had a healthy discussion and we had an agreement. They understood particularly the points I was making. Through that flowed continual discussions in the course of a normal relationship between a minister and his or her department. That is the basic starting point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They came to me. I did not bring them in out of the blue further down the track. They came to me and asked for advice and that is what they got; and, in the way that these conferences are organised, they went to other people for advice as well. They went to Senator Short. That is point No. 1. They came to me. Senator Short knows that and it is very disingenuous of him to come in here and forget all of that background and make that assertion of interference out of the dark. They came to me as their minister&mdash;they recognised the responsibility&mdash;and we discussed the program. As a consequence, there were changes made to the program, to its structure and to the personnel. That also came out last week, but it came out in the context of the responsibility of the minister and parts of my department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the criticism&mdash;which is quite strange&mdash;is that I intervened to take off the program critics of the government. What a joke that is! We see that Senator Short  appears three times in the program: chairing a panel on the government's migration program; participating in a panel on the make-up of Australian society; and, further, participating in a panel on future population growth and flows into Australia&mdash;full participation. Some people may not think Senator Short is a critic because maybe they have not seen him around the place. But the reality is that he is there, Alexander Downer is there, Judith Moylan is there and Tim Fischer is there. All aspects of the political spectrum are involved and there was absolutely no discussion as to whether they should or should not be.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in terms of asylum seekers and other aspects of the program, when we look at the program, we see that there are at least four or five people in it who are critics of the government's agenda and initiatives on and in respect to asylum seekers in this country. Reverend Ian George, for instance, has been a strident critic and was at the last bureau conference. It is a matter of working with the departments to balance a program, and that is what we have done here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People can look at this program and they can make criticisms of it from all perspectives, but the reality is that whether it is the economic perspective, the humanitarian perspective, the asylum seekers perspective or otherwise, there is a balance in this program&mdash;a program that has been developed in consultation. Senator Short cannot throw allegations of interference around when he is such a major player in the conference and when his party is such a major participant. Critics of the government's agenda, apart from&mdash;and Senator Harradine was right in respect to this&mdash;the population aspect, where I had absolutely no participation, are there; people such as Jennifer Goldie and Australians for Ecologically Sustainable Development are there. There is a broad spectrum. It is just that Senator Short's coterie of mates from Melbourne are not participating and that is really bad luck for them.</PARA>

Does the minister agree with the secretary to his department, speaking to the Senate estimates committee last Friday, that the bureau is not `independent' but, rather, is now part of the overall operations of the department?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I address my question to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy in his capacity as the minister responsible for electricity reform. The Senate would be aware that the government set aside $100 million in the One Nation statement for upgrading the electricity grid interconnections between the states as a key component in creating a truly national electricity grid. Can the minister advise the Senate of progress towards the national electricity grid, particularly in regard to the Eastlink proposal between New South Wales and Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3860" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for this question on an issue of significant national importance. The creation of a national electricity grid is central to the electricity reform process that this government began and which was, I might add, enthusiastically endorsed by the state premiers on a number of occasions through the COAG process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West has reminded the Senate that Commonwealth support for the national grid has been clearly demonstrated by the allocation of $100 million through the One Nation statement. In the past, I must say, a national grid seemed to present difficulties for some state governments as distinct from arrangements with interstate road and communication links that have long been a fact of life. This is why the December 1993 memorandum of understanding between the Commonwealth, New South Wales and Queensland to examine the grid connection between those states, which is known as Eastlink, was of such critical importance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attractions of the link are predicated on the fact that New South Wales has excess generating capacity, and Queensland will soon need to expand its capacity. A link will mean the deferral of new power stations, the sharing of power reserves, the possibility of lower electricity prices, strengthening the reliability of supply, and keeping pressure on the price of gas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, almost a year to the day since the MOU was signed, the link is under public threat. The Senate may be aware that New South Wales has threatened to withdraw from Eastlink unless Queensland agrees to participate in it by the 20th of this month. I am extremely concerned about this threat. I have spoken a number of times over the past week or so with the responsible ministers in both states seeking an accommodation between them that is not caught up in the current overheated atmosphere of an election campaign in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both New South Wales and Queensland have made significant strides to implementing electricity reform and, more generally, are committed to the introduction of a competitive electricity market from 1 July next year. I firmly believe that the three governments should honour their commitments to examine Eastlink objectively. I welcome the recent comments by the Queensland Minister for Minerals and Energy, Tony McGrady, that Eastlink `would be a reality' and that there was `not one reason why Eastlink should not go ahead'. I also have no doubt about the willingness of the New South Wales government to pursue electricity reform. I am confident that the link will go ahead subject to community consultations and environmental evaluations that are important to the link. The Commonwealth will continue to pursue with the relevant state governments the objective of a national grid.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Neal for that question. I am delighted to tell the Senate that something like 86 per cent of all child-care centres&mdash;private, community based and employer based&mdash;are now registered and participating in the accreditation process; that means around 2,800 of the 3,300 centres in Australia. It is very good news indeed for those who are following and concerned about the introduction of accreditation. Today I was able to announce the first 13 centres that have been accredited. They included private child-care centres, community based child-care centres and employer sponsored child-care centres. That is also very good news for an emerging unity of purpose amongst child-care operators. The recognition that all those centres from all parts of the long day care sector are part of the accreditation is very good news indeed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Child care is now employing around 70,000 people. That number is only set to grow. It is very useful that we have this unity of purpose. It is also very important in terms of the promise by this government of affordable, accessible and quality care. It is interesting, in the light of interjections from some opposite, that it is an unnecessary process, that that is not what the private centres, the community based centres and the employer centres are saying.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With 13 accredited centres, not only can we tell centres which are still going through the process&mdash;or wondering about it&mdash;to ring the National Accreditation Council; we can also refer them to other centres which have finished the accreditation process and which want to speak so highly of it. The report from all those centres is that the process has been a real plus. It has been a very big success for the staff&mdash;they have enjoyed the process&mdash;and for parents, who have not only learnt in the course of the process but have said that it contributes to increasing their parenting skills. So the news all round is very good.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in announcing the first 13 accreditation centres, we were entertained by children from the Peter Pan child-care centre in the ACT. It is very interesting to note that there is absolutely no substance to the appalling stories about accreditation which were circulating 12 months ago. Boys are still little boys; girls are still little girls. They were enjoying Christmas carols, as most centres are this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also recognise with the accreditation process that multicultural Australia provides for our children music from a whole variety of backgrounds and includes Christmas carols. That is also very important to note when we are looking at multicultural Australia because, as one child-care group in Victoria said, child care provides the `perfect opportunity to include all children right from the start so that no one separate group exists and no-one has to be brought in from the cold'. Multicultural Australia starts with our children. It is reinforced by the accreditation process.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Foreman for focusing on a part of the immigration program which is of continuing importance. There is a great deal of activity in respect of it, and it holds great promise for the contribution it can make to the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Foreman is right: in May I did announce a series of reforms to the business skills category of migration in response to a review by a panel on business migration chaired by Mr Ivan Deveson AO. One of Mr Deveson's recommendations was that the government broaden the range of people who qualify for business migration by testing the concept of a business migration link to capital investment rather than, for instance, hands-on activity in the short time after migrants arrive in Australia. The objective of the subclass will be to offer business migrants the opportunity to make a three-year financial investment in Australia to give them time to consider the long-term prospects of their business strategy and their personal future here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in this new subclass will be required to invest a minimum of $750,000 in a designated government security for a fixed term. Additional points can be earned for amounts up to $2 million, but the government's approach is not just to concentrate on the wealth of those coming to Australia but to look for economic play-makers. In doing so, applicants will have to prove a record of achievement in business or investment and pass other criteria, such as English language points based assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has been implementing this subclass. We have been researching the range of government securities of the size required for eligibility by all state governments, and we have found that all state governments have suitable investment products. They have all been provided with details and been briefed on the program. Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have all indicated that they are keen to participate and make government securities available for this important potential client group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one state that stuns me in its response&mdash;the only exception&mdash;is the state of South Australia, and the South Australian government financing authority. South Australia has admitted that there are no hurdles or impediments to subscribing to this subclass under our business migration program. Nevertheless, it has said that it is not prepared to tailor its existing securities to benefit the state and the people of South Australia. It was fully briefed on what is involved and on the potential to the state. However, the Brown government remains intransigent and is not prepared to accommodate in a way that is quite easily open to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For me, as a South Australian, it is an extremely disappointing response. It is short-sighted and counterproductive and it is a response that the South Australian government cannot afford to take in the interests of the economic and social future of that state. A look at the history of migration in South Australia in recent years reveals that in the last financial year South Australia attracted less than 4.7 per cent of all settler arrivals to Australia. A look at that important part of our migration program&mdash;the business migration program&mdash;shows that only 40 of the nearly 2,000 business skilled migrants who have come to Australia since 1992 intend to live in South Australia. That is just two per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message that the Brown government has now given in its response to our initiative, in its reluctance and incapacity to take up the ball in this respect, is that South Australia is closed for business migration. It is a crude and short-sighted response and it lacks the vision that is needed for the state of South Australia to progress. I have made it very clear to that government and the financing authority there that we are prepared to promote and include the South Australian financing authority subscription to our scheme if it changes its position, even at this late stage of the process. My offer still remains the same.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian migration posts have the responsibility of promoting business migration, and they will continue to do so. There has been a vast increase in the level of interest, particularly in Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea. I would like to see the scheme go ahead with South Australian participation, not without it. South Australia cannot afford to put up the closed sign for business migration. It should change its position. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The Australian Commonwealth Games Association confirmed his participation at the games, with knowledge of the positive test. The ACGA executive made its decision in accordance with its doping policy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Reynolds for her continued interest in Kakadu and the enhancement of Kakadu as a great national asset, a tourist attraction and a World Heritage area. I had the opportunity to view the visitors' centre at Kakadu National Park when I opened the new facilities with the traditional owners in August this year. I must say that I think it is a magnificent piece of architecture. It is functional; it is imaginative; and it is totally in keeping with the natural surroundings of Kakadu.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I was pleased&mdash;perhaps not very surprised&mdash;when I heard that the centre had won the 1994 Sir Zelman Cowen Award for public buildings. This is a national award established by Sir Zelman through his interest in architecture and design in an environmental context. It exists to acknowledge excellence in design and the application of design solutions which improve the quality of the built environment for the whole community. I am sure that any honourable senators who visit the centre would agree with the commentary of the judges for the award, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This marvellous building has a sense of always having been there&mdash;having grown out of the land on which it sits. It is a total design&mdash;controlled from start to finish. People swarm eagerly through this building. It draws you in, positively inviting exploration, and leads you on where there is a reward at every turn.</PARA>
<PARA>These comments are borne out by the number of visitors who attend the new facilities. They have increased markedly and, of course, the visitors who go there are spending more time there. I think the most important feature of this centre is that its form and function showcase the success of the joint management at Kakadu, which is due to the close collaboration between Kakadu's Aboriginal traditional owners, the park managers and the Australian Nature Conservation Agency from my own portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre is representative of Kakadu. It is a place with unique natural features which are globally and scientifically significant and which have the power to obviously impact deeply on visitors to the park. It is a major economic generator which draws visitors from all over the world and provides income and employment for thousands of people. It is a place where Aboriginal traditional owners share their knowledge and deep understanding of the land with all Australians and people from all over the world. The new visitor centre will further enhance the status of Kakadu which, along with Uluru National Park, is an internationally acknowledged and acclaimed model for the management of World Heritage areas involving indigenous people.</PARA>

The question I asked the other day to which Senator Collins did not give me an answer was: how come the main runway and the cross-runway were safe six weeks ago but they are not safe today?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly! He has not said that, and I am glad the minister interjected because that is the issue. If the minister believes it is unsafe to use the east-west runway, let him say so. If he does not believe it is unsafe, let him shut up for a change. Let him pull his head in because he is continually giving the public the impression that there is a risk to safety by opening the east-west runway except in an emergency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are degrees of safety. There is total, absolute and complete safety, and that is probably a touch safer than absolute, total safety. That is the degree of difference between these two operations. Both of them are safe, and the minister knows it. The minister says it is a question of safety because there may well be, perhaps, possibly, a tiny diminution in safety from very total, absolute and complete safety to just total, absolute, complete safety. That is the issue. This minister has set out to mislead the public of Australia by continually saying the decision was made on safety grounds, conveying an impression that there would be a serious diminution in safety if the east-west runway were not used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask him to respond in exactly these terms: would there be a serious diminution of safety if the east-west runway were used in the present configuration? I want to hear that answer because it will put the lie to the proposition he has been putting. I also think it would be nice if he could tell us whether, in fact, the minister who stood to gain from the closing of the east-west runway was advised of the operational decision, taken allegedly on safety grounds, before it was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to comment on the minister's remark that the Premier of New South Wales called for Sydney airport to be curfew free. The minister knows perfectly well what the Premier of New South Wales called for. When New South Wales was having a competitive bid for the 2000 Olympics, he said that the bid would be assisted if there were a removal of the curfew, along with a massive upgrading of airport facilities for Sydney. That is absolutely true. It would have been. </PARA>

The minister knows perfectly well when he comes in here trying to mislead the people of this country about what the Premier of New South Wales said that it related to the Sydney Olympic bid and nothing more. It was not a general plea for the removal of the curfew and the minister knows it. He set out deliberately to mislead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the deceit stakes, I have to say the federal opposition would have to be past masters on this particular subject. I refer all senators to the record of the Senate estimates committee where this matter was discussed last week. The minister is aware that the executive director of the board of Airline Representatives Australia has called for the use of all three runways at Sydney airport. The minister is also aware of claims made by Hazelton Airlines of continuing congestion at Sydney airport since the opening of the parallel runway, and Mr Hazelton's suggestion that commuter aircraft should be permitted to continue the use of the east-west runway in order to enhance capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's policy on the use of the east-west runway is that it will remain in operation. But its uses will be restricted to those periods when weather conditions preclude the use of the north-south parallel runway system; that is, when wind conditions limit operations of the sole use of the east-west runway&mdash;which, historically, is about two per cent of the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other opposition senators with a keen interest in this matter, such as Senator Brownhill&mdash;who has pressed me continually on this issue both inside and outside the Senate&mdash;know that this was always going be the case from day one with the use of the second parallel runway. This might be stating the obvious, but that is precisely why for years we have been dealing with predictions in the EIS of significantly reduced noise to the east and west of the runway. People are not protesting about it&mdash;I do not know why one would expect them to&mdash;because 80,000 people net to the east and west of the runway are now getting less noise than they were before. How can we have significantly reduced noise to the east and west of the runway, which is currently being experienced, without reducing the use of the runway? It was always going to be the case from day one. It is duplicitous to say, `We supported the third runway', but not remove the east-west runway from normal operations. It is an absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the east-west runway was evaluated by the Civil Aviation Authority. The authority advised the minister quite clearly that, on safety grounds, it does not recommend the use of the east-west runway while the parallel north-south runway systems are in operation. In a media release on 30 November&mdash;that is, last week&mdash;the CAA reaffirmed its position that, on safety grounds, it strongly advises against the use of the east-west runway in intersecting operations with the north-south runway system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance sets out very clearly all the things that are wrong with Senator Faulkner in his role as the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and, in particular, in the way in which he has handled the Oyster Point-Port Hinchinbrook project. Unfortunately, the minister is not even in the chamber at present to deal with this matter. Whilst I do not like saying these things in his absence, I have no alternative. The minister has shown his complete incompetence in the way he has dealt with this matter. He has shown how he can be divisive purely for political purposes, regardless of the cost to communities. He has also shown that he has made decisions on the basis of political motivation rather than on the basis of good government and the management of the environment, which is the duty with which he is charged.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you do not need to listen to me to learn of Senator Faulkner's incompetence; you just need to listen to the Queensland Labor Premier, who was asked this question in an interview:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So had Senator Faulkner made a fool of himself?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Goss answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I'm not going to criticise Senator Faulkner; I think the record speaks for itself.</PARA>
<PARA>What a resounding endorsement by a Labor premier of the Labor minister for the environment! Mr Goss obviously has nothing but contempt for Senator Faulkner and the way he has handled this matter. Mr Williams, the developer concerned, was probably a little more accurate when he said of Senator Faulkner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I feel a little sorry for John Faulkner. I think he's been subjected to a bullshit-baffles-brains campaign, and I think the load got to be intolerable for him . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Goss also said of Senator Faulkner:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I think it's an example of a Minister being put under severe pressure by prominent members of the Green movement and one or two other members of the Senate, and responding to that pressure. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Reynolds, who I see is listed to speak in the debate, was nominated by Mr Goss as one of those Labor senators who had put Senator Faulkner under pressure. With regard to the political motivation, I again quote Mr Goss, who said of this issue, `It has more to do with politics than the environment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party have for many years used the environment as a political plaything&mdash;something they can use to garner the second preferences of the Green candidates when it looks like they are about to lose an election. They are certainly in that category again. Senator Faulkner is trying to be the poor man's Richo&mdash;trying to do what Senator Richardson did in the 1990 election. But, regrettably for the Labor Party, Senator Faulkner is not anywhere near the same sort of competent minister as Senator Richardson when it comes to gathering these votes for political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner has made an absolute hash of it all and, in doing so, has divided a town, has cost 40 jobs and has added $1 million to the cost of the project. My office in Townsville has been inundated with calls from people who had jobs on that project but who, because of Senator Faulkner's action, now do not have employment. Work which they were relying on in the lead-up to the Christmas period has now gone and they and their families will suffer as a result of Senator Faulkner's action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps one of the worst aspects of this whole debacle is that Senator Faulkner has now single-handedly created what is perhaps one of the greatest environmental problems in North Queensland at present&mdash;that is, he has stopped all work on that site at a time when the work should have been completed and the site should have been finalised, so that in the coming wet season the site would have been protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it is now, Senator Faulkner has insisted that Mr Williams stop work. He protesteth and says that he has not stopped work on the site. From my reading of the proclamation and section 10 of the act, that is not as I see it. I would like Senator Faulkner to explain that if he reckons he has not stopped the work on the site. The proclamation relating to section 10 of the act certainly indicates that. In any case, one cannot stop part of a proposal and expect the other part to go on around it. So Senator Faulkner has created an enormous environmental problem in that area. Even his workshop of experts has indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current state of the site poses a significant erosion hazard with the imminent onset of the wet season.</PARA>
<PARA>What has Senator Faulkner done about it? Absolutely nothing. He has had some talks. He said he wants to give some advice&mdash;advice, I might say, which was already being given by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;and he is talking about throwing in a little bit of money. Here we are a week on and nothing has happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has now been going for, according to Mr Goss, over 10 months. Senator Faulkner and his department have known about it for 10 months but they did not do anything until 15 November.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did they take action on 15 November? Senator Faulkner says they did so because he has got some new evidence. But when we ask what the new evidence is, we are told that it is advice to his department&mdash;which is a bit patchy anyhow and does not require, on the evidence that is quoted, the developer to stop work. They have recommended that work stop but they do not quote any telling evidence that supports that proposal. In fact, they mention and seek to claim some support from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. But in a letter the day before, that authority quite clearly said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is our belief that the effects of the dredging will be much greater, in terms of sediment release, than the removal of the mangroves, and that removal of re-growth mangroves presents very little threat to the seagrass beds.</PARA>
<PARA>What is more, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority specifically cautioned Senator Faulkner and his department about relying on the opinions of Dr Valentine or Mr Haig. I might simply say in passing: there goes another $15,000 that Senator Faulkner paid to Dr Valentine to bring in a report about which the respected authority, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, says, `Be careful of taking any notice of it.' So there is another $15,000 just wasted by this government and this minister as part of their campaign to try to garner a few second preference Green votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate should be very aware of the loss of investor confidence. There are now seven projects in far north Queensland that are teetering on the brink. Seven lots of jobs, seven lots of places that would bring many millions of export dollars to Australia, are all teetering because investors cannot now be confident that the decision and approval a sovereign government&mdash;the Queensland government&mdash;will not be overridden by bully boys like Senator Faulkner playing political games. Mr Goss, in his very public letter, said this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The handling of this project raises serious issues for federal-state relations, tourism and the environment. There is also concern about the impact of investor confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr Goss is concerned about what investors must be considering. As I say, there is no credible scientific evidence. Even the workshop of experts set up by Senator Faulkner quite clearly states that there is no long-term effect to the seagrass beds from the removal of the mangroves. There will be some moderate effect in the short term in the worst case scenario, but that will fix itself after 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding, I say that there has to be some resolution of this matter. Senator Faulkner has played politics with this long enough. A real environmental problem has been caused to the site solely by Senator Faulkner playing politics. That needs to be addressed now. But better still, for the sake of the environment, for the sake of jobs in North Queensland, for the sake of investor confidence and for the sake of the environment and getting on with the job, Senator Faulkner should do the honourable thing and resign. If he does not, he should be sacked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is no doubt that one of the most significant problems with this development has been the absence of adequate environmental information on which to base decisions about its future. I have consistently pointed that out in all my dealings with the Queensland government on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have repeatedly informed the Queensland government and the developer that if it became clear that World Heritage values were likely to be damaged, I would consider invoking the relevant provisions of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. I made that very clear in correspondence to my Queensland counterpart, Molly Robson. In a letter to her dated 29 September 1994, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">if . . . it becomes clear that World Heritage values are likely to be damaged or destroyed through the proposed development, then it will be necessary for it to be amended in such a way as to avoid that damage or destruction. Otherwise I will need to consider invoking the relevant provisions of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. I would be grateful if you would make that clear to the developer.</PARA>
<PARA>It is not possible to make the position any clearer than I did at that time to my Queensland counterpart. In the weeks preceding the proclamations, I certainly received scientific information which indicated that mangrove clearing at Oyster Point might damage some of the Hinchinbrook Channel's World Heritage values. I also received other scientific information, including the Queensland government's report on seagrass distribution in the Hinchinbrook Channel. There was an accumulating amount of scientific evidence, and I made that available to Senator Ian Macdonald during question time last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to understand that this significant new information, which the baseline study made available to me only on 14 November, was made available after the clearing of the mangroves at Oyster Point had commenced. This new information convinced me that the mangrove clearing would be likely to damage World Heritage values in the channel, particularly the seagrass beds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 14 November, my department advised me to this effect and made a number of recommendations. The recommendations were, firstly, that I approach the Queensland authorities with a moratorium proposal; secondly, that I agree to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the department convening a workshop of experts in order to produce a consensus on the impacts of specified activities on seagrass beds; and thirdly, should the approach to the Queensland authorities for a moratorium be unsuccessful, that I authorise the department to instruct the Attorney-General's Department to prepare the necessary proclamations. Again, nothing could be clearer than that. As I have stated before, this advice was supported by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, notwithstanding the authority's differing views about the scale of the impacts of mangrove clearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 15 November I asked the Queensland government and the developer for a moratorium on clearing the mangroves, pending further scientific assessment. My request was not agreed to by either the Queensland government or the developer, Mr Williams. Therefore, as a last resort, I recommended to the Governor-General that he make proclamations over part of the Hinchinbrook Channel under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My purpose in seeking those proclamations and subsequent regulations was to protect World Heritage values which were likely to be damaged by development activities at Oyster Point. The proclamations in fact cover part of the Hinchinbrook Channel adjacent to Oyster Point. They do not cover any part of Mr Williams's land. These legal instruments do not give me control over the Oyster Point development site. Mr Williams may proceed&mdash;as I have said time and time again&mdash;with any activity which would not damage or destroy the World Heritage property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard about the scientific workshop. That workshop confirmed the importance of the seagrass beds and the potential for turbidity to damage the seagrass. What the workshop has done is to add to the weight of scientific evidence about the nature and extent of the impacts of the development on the seagrass beds in the adjacent World Heritage area. The report makes clear that high quality site management is critical to avoiding damage to World Heritage values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recommended that the remaining mangrove roots should be left in place in order to minimise further disturbance to the sediments. If the proclamations had not been made, those roots would have been removed. The root stocks would have been removed, with consequent damage to the seagrass. The report also recommended urgent short-term stabilisation works at the site in preparation for the wet season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scientific working group dealt only with the issue of the mangroves. There are, of course, other aspects of the development which could have an impact on the World Heritage area&mdash;all of them, I think, associated with the marina component of the development. They would include the construction of a breakwater, dredging and increased visitor numbers in the channel and the nearby islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A meeting was held last Friday involving Queensland and Commonwealth officials to discuss many of these issues. I also met with my Queensland counterpart, Molly Robson, to discuss ways of preventing adverse impacts on World Heritage values and the consequent modifications which might need to be made to the development plans. Significant changes were identified as being necessary. The discussions were constructive and, I hope, have opened a way to a resolution of the outstanding issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Importantly, it was agreed that a foreshore management plan would be prepared to address the problem of stabilisation of the foreshore and to ensure protection of the adjacent seagrass beds. I understand that Queensland officials will be talking to the developer, Mr Williams, today to discuss this and a range of other matters, including the need for immediate action to stabilise the site before the onset of the wet season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said on a number of occasions that I hope that, through the use of cooperative mechanisms, we now have agreed with Queensland that the Port Hinchinbrook development can proceed in a way consistent with my World Heritage responsibilities. Let me emphasise that I intend to continue to discharge my responsibilities to protect those values. I will not resile one inch from my obligation and my responsibilities to protect the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage areas. The sorts of changes to the development we are currently discussing certainly are aimed at ensuring that I can fully discharge those responsibilities. </PARA>

But what this particular episode shows is the need for a situation not to arise where baseline studies are being completed and conducted at the same time as a development is taking place. There is an unarguable case for a proper sequential process in which baseline studies are conducted first, standards are set and a monitoring program is put in place and that those activities precede approvals. The development can then commence with conditions, if appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, last Friday we received some FOI documents from the Premier's office in Brisbane. One of the documents was titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Review of the Draft Valentine Report regarding the world heritage values and the Oyster Point Proposal</EMPHASIS>, written and undertaken by John Wood of the Loder and Bayley Consulting Group. That report said that Peter Valentine was well qualified to do the assessment; that he worked through the issues in a systematic and thorough way; and `that in the absence of a public environmental impact assessment process, the conservative application of the precautionary principle is an understandable response to the uncertainties surrounding the proposal'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, when we read the document we find that the consultants agreed with nearly everything that Mr Valentine said. I quote from the Loder and Bayley review:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald still does not understand that we are now in the 1990s. We cannot rob Peter to pay Paul.

What is the net benefit after we take out the loss of the integrity of Hinchinbrook Island and the surrounding national parks, the cost of turbidity in the channel, the loss of species, the cost of the infrastructure falling on the state and the Cardwell shire, and the cost to the residents through rate hikes, increased land valuations and increased rents?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went and had a look. I went up with an open mind. There is not a person in this place who does not appreciate the Great Barrier Reef, the environment and the importance of it. In my earlier career, going back to the 1970s, I remember putting great restrictions on vessels coming into Mackay because they went through the Great Barrier Reef. We all have that sensitivity, but it is a matter of balance and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I went up, I took some photographs. I could not believe that this was the area being disputed. This is an area that was cleared seven years ago. It looks like a bomb site. The whole thing had been devastated. When I went to look at the mangroves I was expecting to see the big banks that we see from Moreton Bay through to Cape York and up into Papua New Guinea. I found an area of about 100 metres in length by 1.5 to two metres in width. Yet it was the clearing of this area that Senator Faulkner went to the Governor-General to have stopped. As I said, Senator Faulkner did not have the guts to go up himself. He should go up now and apologise to an awful lot of decent people who saw their future in this resort development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ironic thing about this whole matter is confirmed by Senator Faulkner's mate Dr Valentine. We now have a problem there that we would not have had if Senator Faulkner had not done what he did. Neither the minister nor Dr Valentine realised that the damage had been done&mdash;as I mentioned. The mangroves had gone and the only hope of avoiding the disaster that Dr Valentine warned about and that Minister Faulkner was using as his excuse to pander to these extremist obstructionists was for Mr Williams to proceed to stabilise the site. That was the key thing that had to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that was very disturbing was the behaviour of the Minister for Tourism (Mr Lee). When I was at Port Hinchinbrook I said, `Do you know we have a minister for tourism?' The people there said, `No, who is he? We would have thought that, particularly because of the predicted lack of resort accommodation in the north and far north of Queensland, the Minister for Tourism would at least show some interest.' Whether he agreed or disagreed with the development is immaterial. He would be expected to show some interest. He is very quick off the mark in going to conferences and taking credit for the success of other people in the tourism development that has occurred over the last decade and for which this country is very grateful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the silence on Port Hinchinbrook and Oyster Point from the Minister for Tourism, Mr Lee, was deafening. He did not show one bit of interest. He was keeping any interest to himself. Yet he is supposed to represent the industry which is the fastest growing industry in Australia and which has the potential to pick up and give jobs to a lot of the unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The developer, Mr Williams&mdash;whom I have met for only half a minute once in my life&mdash;has inherited a site which has been devastated. The damage had already been done. He spent months dotting his i's and crossing his t's and getting agreements with the Queensland government which had approved the site seven or eight years ago. He scaled his development down to 750 rooms. It would have meant employment during the construction period of up to 1,000 people and ongoing employment of 500 to 600 people&mdash;in a community of about 1,200 people. They did not know of any other developments in the area with the potential to provide them and their children with the long-term jobs that come with this sort of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The town has very few jobs to offer. We have all had letters over this period from people arguing about the importance of this development. No-one disputes the fact that development has to be done in an environmentally sensitive way&mdash;there is no dispute from our side on that&mdash;but there has to be a balance. This whole matter was grossly unbalanced because the minister tried to make a name for himself. To see why he did that senators should look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> from three weeks ago. In it, Senator Richardson said that Senator Faulkner had to make a name for himself. He could not do it in Tasmania because the Labor government made a deal with the Tasmanians not to pinch any more land. So if he wanted to make a name for himself Senator Richardson said that Senator Faulkner should look at Oyster Point up at Port Hinchinbrook. But he picked the wrong site. If Senator Faulkner had looked at it&mdash;and if he had half a brain&mdash;there is no way in the world he would have gone down the track on that one. All he has done is show his gross ineptitude and his appalling mismanagement. He picked the wrong place on which to make a macho stand to appease the extreme obstructionists.

There were some 192 highly critical submissions, including a Commonwealth one, expressing serious concern about several aspects. If the Coordinator-General had responded appropriately then, we would not have had this debate or the proclamation. Very clearly, the fault lies with the office of the Coordinator-General. He was so enthusiastic about wanting to get this development up and running that he and the department forgot to take into account World Heritage values. The department's final report, which is supposed to take account those submissions, has not even been made public.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only that we should be looking at the processes involved with Queensland's responsibilities; we should be looking at the precedent that Mr Williams established in going ahead with his Hamilton Island resort. Let us look at how successful that has been by 1990s standards. In the 1980s it was okay for Mr Williams to bulldoze the top off a mountain, clear the site and build a concrete jungle which we now call Hamilton Island. But let us consider what has happened. Hamilton Island Ltd was struggling to attract visitors and was unprepared to handle its own forecasts of increased demand, Island Traders said in a recent report. </PARA>

I say to Senator Macdonald and Senator Parer that that is precisely why a full environmental and social impact assessment of the Oyster Point resort should have been done, but not because there is anything wrong with putting a resort on that site.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friend on the other side of the chamber, Senator Reynolds, has just told the Senate that one of the problems with ecotourism in Queensland&mdash;and she quoted a Brisbane architect&mdash;was the reluctance of people to invest in ecotourism. I put the question to the Senate: why is it that investors are unwilling to put up their money to invest in ecotourism? The reason why it is so difficult to attract investors to the tourism sector generally and to ecotourism in particular is that they have to deal with a federal government which is indecisive, which is unclear in terms of its direction and which adds immensely to the costs for investors every time a federal minister intervenes, as Senator Faulkner has done, in the middle of the development of a project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key point is simply this: Senator Faulkner had the opportunity, when he was sent the draft tripartite deed, to peruse the deed, to make whatever comments he wanted and to apply whatever conditions he thought were appropriate under the federal legislation&mdash;at that point in time. But Senator Faulkner did nothing to make the Commonwealth's intentions clear. Senator Faulkner allowed the deed to be signed. Then, in the dead of night, Senator Faulkner rushed across to Yarralumla and had the Governor-General sign orders which prohibited further work on the development, and that was the end of that. The project has remained there ever since, because Senator Faulkner could not get it clear to start with about which rules were to apply to this particular development. That is where Senator Faulkner is to blame, and that is what is driving away investors from this sector: they have to deal with a government that cannot make up its mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Reynolds has said that there was a flaw in the process. I heard Senator Faulkner say that as well. He said that there was a flaw in the process because the necessary environmental studies were not sufficient. There are two comments to be made on that. The first is this: zoning approvals and all necessary approvals were already in place for this development, except the approval in relation to the channel. So it is a nonsense to say that it was necessary to have an environmental impact study done because the environmental impact study would have applied principally to the zoning of the land and the application for the resort, and that was already in place. So it is absolutely ludicrous for Senator Faulkner to now say, `Oh, but we didn't have an environmental impact study.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point to make is this: if Senator Faulkner is now of the view that there should have been an environmental impact study, why was he not of the view when he received the draft tripartite deed that there should have been an environmental impact study? Did Senator Faulkner say at that point that there should be an environmental impact study? No, Senator Faulkner was silent on the issue. It is no excuse for the minister to change his mind and say that this should have been done or that should have been done when Senator Faulkner had the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of public importance addresses the whole issue of investor confidence. It addresses how difficult it is to attract new funds, to attract new investors and to attract people who want to build resorts and who want to create jobs when we have a federal government that does not understand how business works. Business works on a very simple proposition: it has a certain amount of risk capital. But the pool is not endless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One developer on the False Cape project near Cairns said to me last week, `We are happy to put up the $600,000 necessary for the study that the government wants for our approval for the marina. But what we don't want to do is get to the stage where the federal government takes nine months to look at the study and then decides it wants further studies. We can live with losing $600,000, but we cannot live with losing $600,000 and then being asked to put up more money.' Business wants to know very simply: is a project to go ahead or is it not to go ahead? Business wants one simple thing from government: a minister who can make up his mind at the very beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in Senator Faulkner is a minister who is incapable of making up his mind.

This development is losing thousands and thousands of dollars every day in holding costs while Senator Faulkner dithers on the issue. Other projects such as False Cape will be held up because Senator Faulkner simply cannot answer correspondence when he is requested to give some assurances as to how long it is going to take the Commonwealth to make up its mind on approvals. Other projects will not go ahead. Because of the indecision of this minister this country will suffer, the people of Queensland will suffer and the tourism sector generally will suffer. I say to Senator Faulkner, as I say to all senators, there is far too much suffering.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the motion to take note of Auditor-General's report No. 11 on ANL valuation issues. Honourable senators will recall that the issue of valuation issues was very prominent in the media a few months ago because of the actions of the government, and in particular Minister Brereton, with regard to the potential sale of the ANL shipping line. I have had no time to examine in detail or to analyse the report that has just been handed down. Therefore, on this occasion I want to make just some brief comments about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report makes clear&mdash;those who have been involved in looking at ANL have known this all along&mdash;that we get different numbers with regard to valuations, depending on the way valuations are carried out. It also reconciles the various valuations that have been carried out of the company, both as a going concern and as a wind-down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In table 1 on page 12 of the Auditor-General's report there is a reconciliation of the detail between the high valuation and low valuation of the shareholders' funds&mdash;that is, between the valuation run by Price Waterhouse-Salomon Brothers and the report of the ANL board. I do not want to comment further on the detail of that because that is not the important political issue. The important issue is really the responsibility of the minister in carrying out the process of the proposed sale of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 4.13 on page 16 of the report indicates that those involved in the sale process can influence the perceptions of potential buyers, and that this can result in a lower price for the asset. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If there is a perception that a seller is a forced or distressed seller the value obtained will be lower than that for a `going concern'. . . What is clear is that the actions and statements of those involved in the sale process can influence the perceptions of the market to the point where the seller will be perceived as a `distressed seller'. This is most likely to result in a lower price for the asset. For this reason it is important that public officials involved in the sale of Commonwealth assets at all times act with discretion in order not to prejudice the Commonwealth's position.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is important not to prejudice the position of all taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What have we had in the case of ANL? We have had a classic case of a minister, Minister Brereton, damaging the value of this asset. On 22 August, the day he sacked the board, he said we could not give ANL away. What could one do that would be more damaging to the sale of that asset? Regardless of whether the actual value of the asset in the final analysis, depending on bids we get in for it, is negative or positive, by hurting potential buyers, by giving the indication that this is a fire sale, definite damage was done to the asset values that we, the taxpayers of Australia, have in that asset, the ANL shipping line. I believe that that was the wrong thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone in Australia understands the concept of buying and selling, be it for a house or a car. When we go through the process of selling a second-hand car, the last thing we do is tell everyone that it is worthless. We invite bids and give the facts but we do not make a value judgment prior to the sale. It is quite improper for a minister of the Crown to be doing that. That is what has happened here. I am pleased to see in section 4.11 of the report that the audit office is sufficiently concerned that it is conducting a further analysis of the sale process carried out by the departments of finance and transport. I think that is most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This minister has been a minister for disasters. In recent times we have been through the disaster of the industrial relations policy for Australia, which has again set Australia back; we have had the CAA disaster; currently we have the third runway disaster; and in September we had the disaster with regard to ANL. The audit office shows quite clearly in the paragraph I read out that there has been damage to the perceptions of potential buyers in the marketplace of the value of those assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Attached to the report is a letter from, interestingly enough, the head of the Department of Finance, Mr Sedgwick. In that letter Mr Sedgwick makes it clear that he wants to distance his department and his officers from the final paragraph in the audit office's report&mdash;in other words, that it has been a distress sale and that actions by public officials involved could prejudice the value of those assets. Mr Sedgwick does not disagree with the substance of that paragraph but I gather from what he says that he is endeavouring to distance his office and his officers from what has happened. But that does not absolve the minister. It is the minister who made the damaging statements that the asset could not be given away. It is the minister who is responsible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correspondence between the minister and the ANL board, which was tabled in the Senate in the last couple of months, shows quite clearly that there was severe conflict between the old ANL board and the minister, and the minister was obviously not being cooperative. The facts of life are that when we look back we see it was the minister&mdash;therefore, the government&mdash;who changed the articles of association of that company back in February of this year. The government changed the articles of association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So any action or decision by the board of ANL that may affect the long-term sale value of that asset must go back to the minister for agreement before the board can proceed. In effect, that meant the board was no longer operating as a board. It was, in fact, the minister operating as the chief executive of the company. As the correspondence which has been tabled in this place makes quite clear, for several months there was lack of communication or lack of agreement from the minister about requests made by the old board of ANL for decisions by the minister, which he did not fulfil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this minister who, I think, has really let Australian taxpayers down very severely. The opposition is in favour of privatising the ANL shipping line, but we are in favour of doing it through proper process. This indicates that the minister has not followed proper process and, as has been made quite clear in the audit report today, we believe it is the minister who has been responsible for down selling the value of the ANL assets. I am pleased that the audit office is going on and looking at the actual proper process&mdash;the process actually carried out by the two departments for the sale of those assets&mdash;to make sure that actual proper process has been carried out.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to add one thing. I support everything that Senator Gibson has said and I stress that the role of the Secretary to the Department of Finance is clearly to try to defend officials, which of course points the finger directly at the minister. I am not happy that the Secretary to the Department of Finance thought the best way to resolve this problem was to excise, to delete, the paragraph from the report. I think that would have been a wrong course of action for the Auditor-General to have taken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would have been appropriate, if the Auditor-General believed it to be so, that he perhaps could have added that there is no evidence that officials have acted in an indiscreet manner in this case. That might be a fair point. On the other hand, I do not know whether it is so. That is simply what is being asserted by the Department of Finance. In any event, the point is that the Department of Finance secretary is clearly, in effect, pointing the finger at the minister and nobody else, no officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are two other points I would like to take up. Firstly, I totally acknowledge the point the Auditor-General has made that the difference between the valuations of the ANL as a going concern and that of it on a distress sale breakup basis are obviously very substantial. I see nothing improper about the Auditor-General's positive valuation, if we can call it that, of endorsing the board's view of what the company was worth as a going concern. It is natural that the much lower value, the minus value, on a distressed sale basis&mdash;which is the basis on which the Price Waterhouse and Salomon Brothers report was based&mdash;significantly reduced the estimated values by a respected valuer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Auditor-General quite properly points out that he does not have enough power in these cases. That, I think, is a serious matter that the Senate ought to address itself to. On page 15, paragraph 4.12, the Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO's mandate currently does not allow it to conduct efficiency audits on GBE's like ANL without the approval of the relevant Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister is the bloke who made the blue, so we are not likely to get him to give such approval. Then he goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Auditor-General Act proposes to extend this to allow both Houses of Parliament to empower the Auditor-General to perform a specific audit. This does not go as far as the JCPA recommended in 1989 viz:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">section 48C of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit Act 1901</EMPHASIS> to be amended to permit the Auditor-General to conduct a performance audit of an eligible corporation without a Minister's permission,</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 15(2) of the Auditor-General Bill should be amended to state that the Auditor-General may conduct a performance audit of a Commonwealth company that is a GBE, or any of its subsidiaries, if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) both Houses of the Parliament, by resolution, request the audit; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the responsible Minister requests the audit; or</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) an audit committee of Parliament requests the audit.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there should be power to the parliament. The Auditor-General should be responsible to the parliament. It should not be under the dictatorial control of any minister because we have seen how incompetent some of the ministers are in this government, particularly this accident-prone minister and his predecessor. The Auditor-General goes on in his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current legislative proposals are unsatisfactory. The Auditor-General should not be constrained from being able to undertake quickly the necessary preliminary work in order to decide whether or not investigations required to prepare a report to Parliament should be undertaken and to undertake such work. The normal financial statement mandate, even if clear and unchallenged (which it has not been for the ANAO for some years) cannot provide an appropriate legal and practical basis for effective reporting to Parliament on all aspects of potential interest to it of a GBE's use of public monies and resources.</PARA>
<PARA>Hear, hear! The thing is that we have here a very large government business enterprise on which the government is now facing enormous losses if it is able to dispose of its asset&mdash;which was not, in fact, earning profits; has had a history of serious difficulties; and, of course, has had the misfortune to have incompetent ministers in charge of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to the government the recommendations by the Auditor-General conveyed here. He should have greater power to investigate the financial situation of GBEs in terms of efficiency audits. I urge the government to take action. I do not expect it to, but I urge it to. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this, for those of us who have been serving on this committee, is a very significant day. It is a report that has taken quite a bit of time, and certainly a great deal of application by a lot of people. Before I get into the detail of the report, I think it is important that I mention those who, in fact, have been very involved and committed, other than those of us who were actually the members of the committee. It is often the case that the staff of the secretariat are left to last. In this case I say that they should be mentioned first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robina Mills was secretary of the committee for one year. Subsequent to that Jane Vincent became secretary&mdash;a difficult job to take over two-thirds of the way through a report and then be responsible for the report itself. Other staff members include Matthew Mason-Cox, David Wallace, Susan Cardell, Lesley Cowan, Debbie Devlin, Laura Gillies, Denise Picker, Kerry Warner and Geraldine Windsor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks, the secretariat members have worked above and beyond the call of duty by any standard. They have worked at nights and on weekends, making it possible for us to present the report today, 5 December. Without such commitment, it would not have been possible to complete a report this size and present it this year. It is not a case of our not wanting to or our arguing about it, but the amount of detail that had to be looked at and attended to was very large. This committee has received submissions in excess of the number received by any other parliamentary committee&mdash;6,197. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry came about from the Family Law Act review and a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aspects of its operation and interpretation&mdash;A report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Operation and Interpretation of the Family Law Act</EMPHASIS>, which was presented in the parliament in November 1992. There were many very significant recommendations in that report. The government has responded to them and now has before the parliament legislation arising from them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the conclusions of that report, which appeared in chapter 16.29, relates to the committee's concern about submissions we received involving the child support scheme. The scheme was not part of the review of the Family Law Act; it has been set up under separate legislation. We received many submissions relating to the operation of the scheme. People's unhappiness with it and the fact that they were being forced to pay maintenance but were not able to get access to their children was an issue frequently brought to our attention. We said in that report in November 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's major concern is that in many cases the non-custodial parent is bearing a disproportionate cost of maintaining the children.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee was concerned about the intent that was put to us at the time. We also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the Government as a matter of urgency must address the anomalies currently inherent in the Child Support Scheme so that both parents share an equitable burden of the cost of supporting their children after marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA>All of us who worked on that committee were very pleased when, after the election in May 1993, when the parliament resumed, the committee was asked to review the child support legislation. The purpose of the child support legislation was to ensure that children are provided for by both parents. It came into the parliament during the 1980s. At the time, a number of us had some misgivings about how it might operate and what its impact would be. I think we said at the time that it should be reviewed&mdash;and certainly it should have been&mdash;but neither I nor any member of the committee came to the view that the scheme should in any way be abandoned. The concept is sound. It needs to be made to work properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee looked at the priorities of the scheme, what we felt was important about it and what tests we would use to determine how we would come to conclusions. They were in this order: that there should be adequate support for children; that the non-custodial parent should contribute to the cost of children; and that the Commonwealth's burden for supporting the children of a broken marriage who are living with a sole parent pensioner should be reduced as much as possible, although it was not the first consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I talk about the Commonwealth's responsibility, I remind the Senate that we are talking about the responsibility of one group of taxpayers for the liability of other people's children. I do not think the committee strayed from those three criteria in determining the 163 recommendations contained in this report. It is not possible or sensible to review 163 recommendations in speaking to the Senate this afternoon. I am sure that you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would not want me to. However, I will speak about some of the things from the report that I think are important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message from the child support legislation of the 1980s, reconfirmed in this report being presented now, is that those who have children have the prime responsibility for supporting them. Other taxpayers will help as is required after that first test has been met. No senator in this place or a member in the other place has not had many representations from constituents about this scheme and its impact on both custodial parents and non-custodial parents. They fall into different categories. None of us would not have met constituents with enormous concern and anguish&mdash;I am thinking about non-custodial parents in particular at the present time&mdash;whose lives have been effectively shattered by the impact of this legislation from several points of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way it has operated has frequently meant that the first people hear about their liability for maintenance is in a letter they receive from the Child Support Agency, a section of the Taxation Office, telling them that they already owe anything from about $1,100 to $1,600. That is one of the principal reasons why it has been almost impossible to get people to understand what the scheme is about and why it was meant to be operating as it was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start anything off with a debt of that size is absolutely hopeless. It has made it impossible for a man in that situation to reorganise his life in any way, having already gone through the shattering and traumatic experience of divorce. He has frequently been left with very little money to live on because of the other debts and commitments that he may have which, quite properly, are not really taken into account in assessing the formula. But that is the consequence of it. Most of all, the unhappiness of people who are being forced to pay maintenance without getting access to their children is very significant. That is the thrust of the first report I mentioned. It is still a real problem in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know people will say that a parent has a responsibility to support children. That is so, but the impact and attitude of a parent thus required to pay maintenance who is not able to get access to the children are perfectly understandable and are a serious difficulty with the whole concept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two parts to the review: a review of the formula under which maintenance is assessed; and the operation of the agency established within the Taxation Office that is administering the scheme. We have suggested that it be reviewed in a few years. My personal view is that the Taxation Office is the appropriate place for this scheme to be administered. But I certainly support the recommendations of the report requiring the agency to do it somewhat differently from the way that it has been done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency started off with a brand new scheme from a standing start. In most instances, such institutions would have to wait for their clients to come in. Not so in this instance, where it started off with nearly 24,000 clients, which made it extremely difficult. That number has now risen to about 275,000 clients, or perhaps even more by now. So the impact on those in the Taxation Office who were required to set it up and administer it was great indeed. I understand the problems they faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we can question whether they had adequate resources to do what they were required to do&mdash;that is, assess debt, collect money and pay it out&mdash;and whether they had received adequate training to do it. But the impression I have certainly formed from the constituents who come to my office is that attitude is perhaps the biggest problem. Often, a perfectly reasonable person who is quite happy to pay maintenance for his children on a proper basis complains of being made to feel like a criminal when dealing with the Child Support Agency. I regard that as being totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the Child Support Agency within the Taxation Office is required to regard both custodial and non-custodial parents as clients and to deal with them fairly. I have no doubt, from the number of complaints that I received about the way that people were treated, that it was not people's imagination, that people were made to feel like criminals and made to feel that they were in the wrong when they made inquiries and in many other ways. We have recommended that in the future the office have people responsible for cases so that what has happened in the past stops. If people ring up&mdash;anyone listening may have had this experience&mdash;they are never able to get on to anyone in the agency who can really understand a question or answer it. There have been instances of explanations being given by one office which were different from those given by another office. There are many things which I will not go into in much more detail. But the operation of the scheme must be carried out differently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the recommendations that we have made in the report. The initial operation of the recommendations will mean that the custodial parent should receive money more regularly and sooner and not have the incredible delays that some people have experienced in getting money that has been paid to the office. Most importantly, our recommendations will mean that a person encountering the scheme for the first time will not be met with such a debt as has occurred in the past. Those non-custodial parents will have a better right of appeal and review than has happened previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to encourage voluntary compliance with the act. I believe that many more people would pay and would accept their responsibility to pay and that it is not necessary to divert so much of the agency's resources to collecting funds as is happening at present&mdash;withholding from wages and things of that nature. With regard to those who do not pay, we have very strict views on how they should be dealt with. But I think there is a great deal of room to encourage people to do this on a voluntary basis. People should be able to ring up the agency and find out what they have to pay, pay it and effectively have no involvement with the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there has been a change in community attitude so that there is now acceptance that non-custodial parents do become responsible for paying maintenance for their children. I feel quite confident that voluntary compliance will become more prevalent and the agency can then get on with dealing with the difficult cases and with the defaulters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A particular area of concern is that most of my constituents are PAYE taxpayers who can be fairly easily caught up with under the scheme. But it was clear from a number of points of view that some people are able to avoid paying or are able to keep their income down. We have made recommendations that the Taxation Office should make assessments and deal with non-PAYE non-custodial parents more efficiently than has been the case in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My attention was drawn to that matter during the phone-in that we conducted. It might be recalled that in July 1993 we had a phone-in in which thousands of calls came into the building. We reported to the parliament in a little document called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Thanks for listening</EMPHASIS>. A number of the people to whom I spoke were not getting the maintenance that they ought to have been getting because the non-custodial parents were not PAYE taxpayers. There are ways of protecting self-employed people who are very low income earners and those who are not, and we have dealt with that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package of 163 recommendations is interlinked. When we deal with the formula, a dollar here or a dollar there can make a great deal of difference. We have made recommendations for changes to the formula. We have said that that which has been called, for a non-custodial parent, a self-support component is not in fact a self-support component. It is an amount of income that should be disregarded before the formula operates. It might be thought that that is just playing with words but in fact it is a little more than that. When we look at the formula, we see that the amount of income disregarded is not the only amount left for a person to live on. There is money at the other end as well. However, we have recommended that the amount of disregarded income be increased&mdash;not by a huge amount, not by as much as some people would have liked, but by a reasonable amount which will make a difference. But it must be balanced at both ends. The whole package of recommendations must be integrated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a recommendation with regard to the income of the custodial parent that should be disregarded. We have made a significant recommendation relating to income earned by a custodial parent&mdash;that, for every $1 increase above the disregarded income level, the reduction should be only 50c, not $1. We were anxious to make sure that there were not disincentives for custodial parents to return to the work force. We wanted to make sure that we minimised any poverty traps which can always occur when dealing with social welfare payments.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have included fringe benefits to be assessed as part of income when determining the amount which should be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I have only touched the surface of the 163 recommendations which are now before the government. I urge the government to consider them quickly and to bring in legislation in accordance with the recommendations in order to make changes which I believe are very necessary for this community, as there are a lot of very unhappy people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other things that I would like to say but I will conclude so that others can speak. I say to men and boys in particular that if they have a one-night stand and they become the father of a child, they will be paying for it. I can vividly recall one young man who certainly got caught, probably deliberately. I did not doubt his story at all. But there is no way that this scheme can be made to work if we start to make that sort of exception. People need to know that if men father a child, they will be paying for it, not their neighbour, their friends or some other taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had difficulty with the concept of re-partnering&mdash;the impact on that family if a man re-partners with a woman, when he is paying maintenance for his child under the scheme, but she has children with her and for some reason is not receiving maintenance. Not every problem&mdash;and they are real problems&mdash;can be corrected. We have not been able to do so. I have no doubt that some people will be disappointed that we have not gone far enough, done enough or included everybody. But if people read the whole report, or even just the whole of the recommendations and conclusions, they will see the logic behind what we have done in preserving the concept of maintenance being paid, as set down in the legislation. They are recommendations which will make the administration of the scheme much better. There is a formula which, while not going as far as it might, will make a difference. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this report I would first like to thank the members of the secretariat, who have so ably and professionally assisted the work of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues. I am sure they were instrumental in ensuring the production of such a high quality document which has canvassed so many complex issues in such a way as to highlight some real solutions to those problems. They may not be the solutions that everyone wants to see; they may not be the complete answers that we are looking for. But in terms of this report, they indicate a substantial body of work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research undertaken by the secretariat is in some cases probably the most up-to-date, most detailed research that has been undertaken in this area of family law. In terms of family studies, it is some of the most detailed research work that is available to date. In some senses it is difficult for other areas to challenge the expertise that has been available to this committee. Those involved in the professional areas of investigation could learn a substantial amount from the work undertaken by the secretariat of this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would like to thank the other members of the committee I have worked with. It is one of the most beneficial committees I have been involved in in the period that I have been in this parliament. There have been very valuable meetings on a regular basis where people from all the different shades of opinion were able to speak freely to one another, communicate effectively and present quite complex and difficult issues to one another, and produce a result which is substantially agreed, with the odd difference which I am sure others will speak of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency has now been in operation for 6 1/2 years. It was established on 1 June 1988, and it is appropriate that this parliament undertake a comprehensive review of its operations. Given the level of public interest, as measured by the 6,197 submissions, it is quite clear that this review is long overdue. The largest number of submissions that has ever been received by a parliamentary committee was presented to this committee and reflected very deep concerns within the community about the nature of this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reiterate Senator Reid's comments. There is no-one on this committee who would challenge the benefits of the social reforms introduced by the establishment of the Child Support Agency. The fundamental commitment right across this parliament is to the continued work of the Child Support Agency. It has to be acknowledged that there have been enormous achievements in this area of social policy. However, I think it is also very important that parliament understands that the nature of the work we undertake in establishing government bodies like these has to be measured in terms of the impact on the community which is affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular area of social policy we found that 90 per cent of custodial parents&mdash;a very large number of clients&mdash;are sole parent pensioners, extremely low income people. In terms of the non-custodial parents, 81 per cent of the client base earns less than average weekly earnings. The agency is a body that this parliament has established essentially to police the social, the economic, the familiar relationships between working class people in this country. It is a body that&mdash;whether or not we understood it the time&mdash;is effectively geared towards the very poorest and, in many respects, the weakest in our community. It is because of the nature of the issues that are involved&mdash;the protection of children and the provision of basic financial survival assistance for children and custodial and non-custodial parents&mdash;that we can understand that the stakes are very high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government&mdash;the state agency&mdash;has contact with people at a time in their lives, immediately after separation, often when they are undergoing a most severe trauma and when relationships and emotions are at their very rawest. It should be understood that emotions are going to be at their highest and levels of tension are going to be at their greatest. But we are also dealing with people who often are least able to express their demands and their grievances and defend their interests when it comes to dealing with the state apparatus. For me, it is a bit of a challenge in a personal sense because I am one of those who believe that the state is the best vehicle for liberating people and for ensuring that they get access to proper services, quality of life and adequate standards of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the state operates as has occurred through this agency and becomes effectively a harsh, oppressive instrument, and people react in ways in which they are not able to defend themselves and which are often not in their own interests, it becomes quite a conflict for my philosophical position. This is a case where the state has not always been able to present the best possible position to ensure that people do have the best services that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has once again come up against that basic problem that in family law there are no absolutes. We have tried to provide a report which reflects the complexities of the issues, and provides real balance in the interests that are being expressed between separated and intact families, children of first and subsequent families, custodial and non-custodial parents and parents and taxpayers generally. This report seeks to establish a balance that allows for this complex interrelationship between social and economic forces that are measured in the way the state operates by instituting laws concerning taxation, social security, family law and the Child Support Scheme itself. It is in that context that we understand, when we say there have been some achievements, just how great those achievements have been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most fundamental achievement of all is that there has been a successful transformation in attitudes within this community about the way in which there should a universal system for the collection of child support and, therefore, a change in the attitudes about the way in which parents should take responsibility for the support of their children. We have discovered that this change in attitude has not necessarily been as a result of a perfect scheme. In fact, there are huge weaknesses in the way in which this scheme currently operates. I take the view that there has to be substantial reform to that scheme to protect a very valuable social reform in total. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to be understood is that because there are so many people trapped within the scheme who are often so weak, special measures have to be taken by the government to ensure that the interests of both custodial and non-custodial parents are protected. It is ironic that the wealthiest people in our society&mdash;the people that can afford the lawyers, and can afford and have access to the education and the various facilities that wealth brings with it&mdash;are able to stay outside of this scheme. So we have a scheme that is universal in theory that applies only to the poor. In that sense there is a fundamental inequity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other inequities in this scheme as it currently exists. If we look at its very objectives which are stated within the legislation, we begin to understand that there are some unintended consequences from this legislation. There was talk of adequate support being available to all children not living with parents; that non-custodial parents contribute and support according to the capacity to pay; and that the Commonwealth's expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure adequate support for children. That often provides conflicting priorities, which inevitably means that there is confusion surrounding the varying objectives of this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the weaknesses in this scheme, we see that there is a profound sense in which there is a bias against non-custodial parents in this program. There were 11.2 per cent of submissions which indicated very grave concerns about the way the scheme operates in practice&mdash;in particular, the objectives of the scheme which refer only to the capacity of non-custodial parents to pay when in fact they ought to refer to the capacity of both parents to pay for the support of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a whole range of institutional weaknesses within the scheme as it currently exists which go to these questions of basic inadequacy. These include, for instance, the very simple matter of the disregarded income, as it is referred to, of the custodial parents which, of course, is substantially different from the disregarded income that is included for calculation of this scheme for non-custodial parents. There are many other weaknesses. There are huge administrative weaknesses within the scheme. Senator Reid has already referred to the substantial concerns about the operation of the Child Support Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many respects, that has to be understood, given the circumstances of the agency's creation and operation on a daily basis. In fact, the case load for the Child Support Agency is growing at 7,000 per month. The rate of growth of clients of this agency makes it extremely difficult for a government body such as this to cope. One can understand the difficulties that arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, our inquiry has identified serious weaknesses which point to some very serious management problems within the Child Support Agency&mdash;some very serious problems of coordination and failure to establish national policy guidelines, some very serious inadequacies in the question of staff training and some very serious weaknesses in the way in which people are treated by this government agency, which, in my judgment, is totally unacceptable. The fact is that some government agencies treat people in a way that presumes guilt and fault when the whole basis for family law in this country, at the present time, is to the contrary. However, as I said, we cannot convince people that the contrary prevails, given the way in which this agency has operated on an administrative basis and given that people get correspondence on the basis of there being a presumption of fault by one party, which in most cases is the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are much deeper structural issues that go to the question of the formula itself, and this was the other major area of our inquiry. We received 1,505 submissions which stated that the formula was too harsh; 24.3 per cent of the record number of submissions received by the committee highlighted this problem. What was clear to us, after a very comprehensive review of the literature and investigation into this matter, was that the original work undertaken to establish the various levels within the formula was essentially very arbitrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a major problem in policy terms whereby decisions were made about the level of support and the operation of the formula. Essentially, this suggests that the consultative group was arbitrary and represented judgments made by the original consultative group which were not necessarily based upon the Australian experience. These judgments may well have suited the American experience or understandings of what was occurring in other countries, but there appears to be a substantial need for further research to be undertaken in regard to Australian conditions. I believe that significant changes need to be made in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues and problems were not canvassed or understood later as unintended consequences. One of the major weaknesses of the present scheme, as far as I am concerned, is its bias against women. I know it is often said that this is a scheme which is biased against men&mdash;I have just said that in the case of non-custodial parents&mdash;but there is an inherent bias in the scheme in that it discriminates in favour of some women against other women, particularly women who are in second and subsequent families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time the original legislation was brought forward, I do not think the sorts of changes that were occurring in the demography of this country were understood. What is occurring now is that most people who are divorced remarry within 2.8 years; for most women, I think the figure is three years. For most people, there is a change in circumstances which occurs very quickly. That brings a whole series of new problems. From the way the evidence points at the moment, there quite often appears to be an in-built bias within the scheme against those second families. In that sense, this scheme is biased against women, particularly women who are in second and subsequent families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with much of what Senator Reid said. But I think we have to understand that there is a need for substantial reform within the present scheme to protect it against quite serious weaknesses which are becoming evident and which were perhaps unintended at the time the legislation was originally introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has to be understood that there are very grave concerns about the interaction between social security, child support, family law and the taxation legislation. This is creating very serious work disincentives and, in my judgment, very serious social problems in the relationships of people who are trying to establish new lives and who have responsibilities for supporting children in a number of family circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Parliament has to understand the complexities of social relationships in our society today. Divorce rates are quite high and are increasing, particularly for subsequent families. There seems to be a suggestion that the effect of family law matters, particularly Child Support Agency matters, could be part of the reason why those figures are so high. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend this report to the Senate. I trust that it is read and digested within the community at large. I trust that the government will be able to respond quickly and introduce the necessary reforms to see that the report's recommendations are implemented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to comment on the report by the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Child support scheme: An examination of the operation and effectiveness of the scheme</EMPHASIS>, to quote in full the reference that was given to the committee. In dealing with that reference, the committee had the quite major task of assessing whether an adequate balance has been achieved between the often competing interests of separated and intact families, children of first and subsequent families, custodial and non-custodial parents, and parents and taxpayers generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of these issues in the community can be gauged from the fact that the committee received 6,197 submissions, which is the largest number of submissions ever received by any parliamentary committee. In assessing that volume of concerns, the committee had to bear in mind one principle which is enshrined in the Family Law Act&mdash;that is, the child's welfare must be the major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee addressed its collective mind to the order of priorities that should be used in the child support scheme. I believe that it is a useful guideline in this area. According to the committee, the order of priority should be, firstly, that adequate support is available to all children not living with both parents; secondly, that non-custodial parents contribute to the child support payments according to their capacity to pay; and, thirdly, that Commonwealth expenditure is limited to the minimum necessary to ensure adequate support for children. The committee was conscious of the fact that, sometimes in the past, there seems to have been a concern to protect the Commonwealth's purse&mdash;particularly on the part of the Taxation Office&mdash;perhaps at the expense of some of the families and children who had to rely on the child support scheme to obtain reasonable contributions to their cost of living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made 163 recommendations concerning the operations of the Child Support Agency and the child support formula. The issues are obviously complex and it would be foolhardy to claim that we have arrived at the best possible solutions. It is an area which will require continual monitoring and, I suspect, numerous amendments in the future. I think it is fair to say that, in many ways, the committee was hampered in its work by inadequate information and research available in many areas, quite apart from the value judgments that have to be made. We need to be conscious, therefore, that formulae do not solve all the real and often traumatic rearrangements which follow a divorce. But the overriding duty, of course, is to provide security of income to custodial parents and the children they look after. In that sense, I support what has been said by others&mdash;that the principle of the child support scheme has been unanimously found to be valid by the committee and that we must persevere in achieving its best possible operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in passing that the child support scheme was one of the original terms of reference for the family law inquiry, but was considered then to have been outside the terms of that inquiry. However, I am very pleased that it has now become the subject of a separate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record my appreciation of the valuable work and effort that every member of the secretariat gave unstintingly to this inquiry. I know it has taken many nights, quite apart from weekends and normal working hours, to provide the material on which the committee could base its decisions, and credit is due to a team which has worked extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the prime responsibility of the Child Support Agency&mdash;that is, to collect and pass on the child support payments according to a formula&mdash;we must conclude that the record is not brilliant. The agency claims a collection rate of 75 per cent. However, this rate is not supported by the facts. It excludes $202 million of child support due under default assessments and includes private collection cases which involve no action by the agency. If these were taken into account, the proportion of successful collections would be of the order of 38 per cent&mdash;not a particularly brilliant performance. I will return to that point in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also received considerable evidence from non-custodial parents claiming bias against them. In particular, it was charged that the scheme refers to the capacity of only non-custodial parents to pay and that it should place greater emphasis on the capacity of both parent to pay. It is an area that the committee has dealt with in considerable detail. Some of its recommendations are addressed to this area and will alleviate some of the concerns, at least in part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agency was established in 1988 as a division of the tax office. The problems the agency faced can be gauged by the rapid growth in case load from 23,380 in 1988-89 to 275,218 in May 1994. This is a case load that is growing at the rate of 7,000 per month and the staff employed by the agency is expected to reach 1,600 at the end of 1994-95. Clearly, the resources of the agency are stretched in coping with this rapidly growing case load. So much so that we have had reports&mdash;quite apart from evidence to the committee from users of the scheme who have found difficulties with it&mdash;from other agencies, in particular the Ombudsman, that the complaints against the agency tend to be repeated year after year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amongst the complaints that have been lodged and the reasons identified by the committee for the judgment that the management of the agency is not all it could be are, firstly, the failure to appreciate that the agency must supply a service both to custodial and to non-custodial parents; and, secondly, there is an over-reliance on the financial culture of the Taxation Office. It was very clear to the committee that there needs to be a much stronger service orientation and that this must be reflected in the staff training of the agency. There was also quite obviously a lack of corporate support from the Taxation Office to the agency&mdash;for instance, in the location of non-payers&mdash;and generally a poor level of coordination and cooperation between the Child Support Agency, the Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inaction and lack of service to clients, which is reflected in the way in which clients are dealt with by this agency, is really quite appalling and it is inexcusable that this has been allowed to go on for some considerable length of time. Many of the areas that need rectification lie in the methods employed by the agency. But, I repeat: most could be rectified to a very large extent by the agency adopting a different attitude&mdash;an attitude that sees the people serviced by the agency as clients who require support in a period of their lives which is quite traumatic, rather than as people to be got rid of as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard evidence of many delays in application, registration and collection procedures, both at agency level and at the initial application stage. It has been established that there is a delay of approximately 142 days between the start date of liability and the day upon which the Department of Social Security pays the custodian the first child support payment, and that is really quite appalling. Another statistic which is evidence of the inadequacy of the management and performance of the agency is that there is a build-up of 65 days of child support arrears before the non-custodial parent is informed of the amount of the child support liability. The committee has made a number of recommendations in this area. We estimate that the delay of 142 days can be reduced by approximately 63 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that the committee has recommended will, I trust, encourage a more positive relationship between the Child Support Agency and non-custodial parents. They should improve the level of voluntary compliance under the scheme; they should reduce the current reliance on collection by the agency; and, overall, they will reduce the cost of administering the scheme. All of these changes are in the area of giving non-custodial parents the option of paying voluntarily rather than being automatically placed in the withholding category. It is certainly a development that should be pursued by the agency and I trust that the recommendations of the committee will lead to that. It is quite clear that many parents would have opted for this method but for the arrangements under the agency's operations which mitigate against this development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, the committee believes that the recommendations that have been made by the committee will lead to an overhaul. However, as I have said before, no matter how many amendments and changes are made as a result of these recommendations, we cannot expect to have heard the final word on the operation of the Child Support Agency. It is necessary to comment briefly on the recommendations made in the area of the child support formula. Two recommendations stand out in dealing with what has been seen as a somewhat unfair distribution of load. In particular, the joint committee has recommended that the custodial parents disregarded income level be reduced to the applicable pension cut-off point, currently $19,723. Similarly, to shift the load between custodial and non-custodial parents a little further, the committee has also recommended that the non-custodial parent basic formula support component be increased by 20 per cent, from $8,221 to $9,865. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that these changes, while certainly not very far-reaching, indicate the complexity of the situation. The committee found itself constrained both by the amount of information available to it and by the quite significant changes in liability which result from even minimal changes to the formula. It is an area that will need to be monitored on a continuing basis and I suspect that this chamber will again be considering the Child Support Agency and the way it operates in the not too distant future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to speak on the report of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues relating to the child support scheme, on which report substantial comment has been made already. The whole issue of the financial support of children after separation is an emotive one. It often entails a situation where couples are having difficulty coming to terms with the separation and also with how their children should be dealt with and cared for after separation. It also often entails a situation where the financial resources available are being spread too far, with two households having to be set up, and are inadequate to meet the needs of all parties concerned in a satisfactory way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As earlier mentioned by Senator Carr and Senator Reid, there is no doubt that parties affected by the Child Support Agency are largely from the poorest groups in our community. Approximately 91 per cent of custodial parents&mdash;that is, parents with children in their care&mdash;and 68 per cent of non-custodial parents earn less than $20,000 per annum. Of that 91 per cent of custodial parents, many are at least partially in receipt of the sole parent benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report has attracted huge public interest. In fact, in addition to the phone-in, during which the parliamentary phone system almost melted down, and the extensive oral submissions to the committee, we received in excess of 6,000 written submissions. The submissions showed a strong public dissatisfaction with the manner in which the Child Support Agency was being administered. I accept these views and I endorse very strongly the idea that some action must be taken to remedy the situation. I will refer to the recommendations contained in the majority report to some extent at a later stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding these concerns, it is my view that the Child Support Agency has gone along the track of satisfying its prime objective, which is to improve the position of children of separated parents. The fact is that children covered by the scheme&mdash;that is, children born after 1 October 1989, or children and their siblings whose parents separated after that date&mdash;are more than twice as likely to receive financial support from non-custodial parents as children not covered by the scheme. This clearly indicates that children to whom this scheme applies are in a much better position than children who are not covered by this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the commencement of the scheme in 1989, only 30 per cent of non-custodial parents paid maintenance. Now, 73 per cent of children covered by registered child support agreements collected by the Child Support Agency receive maintenance. The level of maintenance is also up. An average of $26 per week was paid in 1988, while in 1992-93, the latest year for which figures are available, $42 was payable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that children of separated parents are financially better off now than they were before the commencement of the scheme. Essentially, I am saying that the children for whose benefit this scheme was brought in are better off&mdash;notwithstanding many of the complaints of parents who are also affected by the scheme&mdash;and, in my view, that is what is most important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the report is taken up with satisfying the complaints of affected parents. I am fully in agreement with the majority of the recommendations contained in the report. I refer in particular to changes in the system for dealing with clients. It was indicated in many of the submissions, both oral and written, that the Child Support Agency and, consequentially, the Department of Social Security were insensitive in their dealings with clients, being both custodial and non-custodial parents. It was said that they seemed to lack any appreciation of the emotional difficulties being faced or the fact that many parents after separation are unaware of their legal obligations and how the system operated and had a great deal of difficulty understanding a lot of the correspondence they received from the agency. As it was put to us, there has been some attempt already by the Child Support Agency to deal with these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most common complaints received was that it was an almost impossible task for clients of the agency to get in touch with that organisation. Often they would sit on the phone for hours and hours, trying for many days before receiving a response. When eventually they were able to speak to someone, often they were not able to deal with a person who had any knowledge or awareness of their particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a marked change in the system, with the Child Support Agency placing a great deal more emphasis on answering phone inquiries, dividing them into inquiries for general information and more specific inquiries dealing with particular cases. With the present changes, it is now normal to at least have a telephone inquiry answered within 10 to 15 minutes, which is outstanding, bearing in mind what it was previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also recommends that a lot of the written material that is forwarded to those dealing with the Child Support Agency be simplified. I have some legal training but I was at a complete loss to understand what it was trying to express in its statements and correspondence. Any simplification will help everybody concerned. There was also a major problem in the collection of child support and a concern that it was taking too long. Senator Spindler referred to this earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of recommendations in the majority report which I support strongly, in particular one concerning processing times. An example was given of a parent in receipt of sole parent benefit who forwards the application form for child support to the Department of Social Security or drops it in. Evidence was provided to us that the first step involved, which was to transfer the form to the Child Support Agency, took an average of 17 days. The worst cases took up to 63 days&mdash;and that was before any processing was commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also a large number of recommendations in the report about improvements in collection. Changes there are long overdue. Improvement also needs to be made to the checks on the receipt of child support and its transfer to the custodial parent. Some evidence was provided to the committee that in many cases, if child support was not paid on time, no checking was done until the custodial parent rang up and queried it or made a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is presently a major problem in the collection of child support moneys, even though it is stated to us by the government agencies that 73 per cent of child support payable is being collected. There is an accumulated debt, as of April 1994, of $272 million. That means that $272 million that should be going towards the care and support of children is not being collected. This is obviously a major problem. The report also contains recommendations to deal with this difficulty. I strongly support those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am less than enthusiastic about some of the matters raised in the report about the child support formula and the attempt by the committee to deal with the cost of bringing up children. The committee was not in as good a position as a lot of its predecessors. The percentage payable for child support was based extremely roughly on the Lovering survey. Essentially, people involved in that survey went out and bought a basket of items roughly involved with the care of a child. They then worked out roughly what that cost might be as a proportion of income of those on average incomes. It is not a system, I think, that creates a fair assessment of what it really requires to bring up a child&mdash;at least in a financial sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really did not have any better information provided to us than that. There was a lot of debate within the committee about whether it would cost as much to bring up a child as the child support formula provided. Opinion was quite divided. Being the parent of a couple of small children, I am not astonished by any costs involved in bringing up a child. I am of the view that in most cases no amount of child support can fully satisfy all the needs of the child, but it must take into account the capacity of the parents to pay&mdash;in particular the capacity of the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with the formula there were three matters on which I really could not agree with the majority of the committee. As a result, I prepared a brief minority report which is appended to the majority report. I will briefly go through those three matters. The first recommendation that I put forward was that the Child Support (Assessment) Act should be extended to all children of separated parents. As I earlier stated, the act at this stage applies only to a small proportion of children of separated parents. It applies only to those children who were born to parents separated after 1 October 1989, or the siblings of those children. That means that approximately one-third of children of separated parents are covered by the child support act. Because of my view that the children covered by this scheme are in a much better position than children not covered by it, I think it is certainly in the interests of those children not covered to come under it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of matters other than those which relate to direct benefits to children which indicate that for the community there is an ongoing cost in having two competing systems of providing child support&mdash;or maintenance, as it is known under the Family Law Act. This ongoing cost does not translate into any benefits. Even though there has been a dramatic increase in the level of maintenance payable under the scheme, there seems to be a fairly close link between the amount of child support being paid on average pursuant to judicial orders and that being paid as a result of the application of the formula. At the moment, the average maintenance payable pursuant to court orders is $42 and the average maintenance payable pursuant to the formula is $42. Even though in strict legal terms it cannot be said that there is a requirement to work out the amount a certain way, it is contrary to the principles contained in the Family Law Act for the child support formula to be used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that, in a practical situation where most maintenance orders are being made by magistrates who deal not only with family law but with criminal law and every other matter that comes to the local court, magistrates rely very heavily on the formula as an indicator of what is fair to be paid as maintenance. The whole principle of using the child support formula as an indication for quantifying what the payment of child support should be was endorsed by the Family Court in a case in 1992. This indicates very strongly that there is really no practical reason to continue to have the competing schemes and no continuing reason to have the cost of dealing with matters through the Family Court system and through the local court when children covered by the child support scheme are in a better position than the children in families not covered by the scheme, and that it would be of great benefit to reduce the cost, while at the same time putting the children in a better position. That proposal was supported by a large number of submissions received by the committee, in particular from the Family Law Council and the Law Society of New South Wales family law branch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter on which I dissented from the majority report concerns the reduction of the custodial parent's disregarded income level below its present level. As has been indicated, there was a large number of submissions that drew a direct comparison between the exempt income of the non-custodial parent and the disregarded income of the custodial parent. They saw these figures as being equivalent. They looked at the two figures, which were quite vastly different, and drew the conclusion that the incomes of custodial parents and non-custodial parents were not being properly dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose we really have to go back to the essential principles involved and have a look at what those two figures really represent. The amount which is set aside for non-custodial parents is a figure which is provided as an initial starting point for their support. It is very difficult with these sorts of formulas to clearly state exactly what they cover, but I will make an attempt at it in the hope that the substantial effect of the formula is expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, we start off with the income of a non-custodial parent and deduct the self-support, or exempt, component. Once we have deducted that money and set it aside, the percentage is applied. Let us say a non-custodial parent is earning $10. The self-support component of $1 is set aside, and to the remaining $9 the percentage formula&mdash;18 per cent&mdash;is applied for one child. So the general view that that self-support component that is taken out is the only money which the non-custodial parent can rely on is essentially false because the percentage balance which is remaining is also retained by the non-custodial parent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the custodial parent's disregard component. This is the component whereby, if the custodial parent earns over a certain amount, the excess amount must be taken into account in determining the amount of child support payable. The custodial parent's disregard income is meant to represent the in kind contribution of that custodial parent towards the care of the child. In other words, custodial parents do not actually pay money, but when they are looking after the child they cover the child's costs&mdash;the electricity in the house, the rent, and the cost of transporting the child around. Also, to some extent custodial parents forgo the opportunity for employment, and this component is in some way meant to make up for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In making the mistake of dealing with these two figure as equivalents, the committee recommended the reduction of the custodial parent's disregard income level to the cut-off point for the sole parent's benefit. I believe there is a real danger in doing this. I suppose that with 91 per cent of custodial parents earning less than this amount anyway, the practical effect of reducing the disregard income level is quite minimal. But the fact is that the majority of sole parents are amongst the poorest in our community, and by creating another barrier to their breaking out of the poverty trap and improving their financial position, we are making it even more difficult for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last recommendation, which I strongly disagree with, is the reduction of the maximum cap for non-custodial parents. Previously if they earned over 2.5 times the average weekly earnings, which is about $83,000, they did not have to pay a percentage of income earned over that amount. The recommendation contained in the report reduces that cap to two times the average weekly earnings, which effectively means that those non-custodial parents who earn between $63,518 and $83,147.50 get an unexpected windfall. Those people&mdash;I cannot say I believe them to be the poorer members of our community&mdash;get to pay less child support for their children who, very often, are in the care of sole parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to the majority report to express my strong support for the majority of recommendations. I am unable to agree with only those three matters. I have to say that I, being a new senator, was very pleased to see how seriously all the senators involved took their job and how hard working and diligent the secretariat was. It was a privilege to be involved with the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot possibly suggest that this inquiry has been enjoyable or easy. The remarks I make are spoken more in sorrow than in anger. They are certainly remarks born of frustration at a system that appears to be intransigent, insensitive and inappropriate to modern and postwar Australia. Child support is a vexed question in every country, and it is certainly a difficult and disturbing issue for separated parents in Australia. When one discovers how the system operates, it is little wonder why it is so appalling.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry arose out of many concerns expressed during the first inquiry of the Joint Select Committee on Certain Family Law Issues into the Family Law Act. The family law committee report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee considers that the Government as a matter of urgency must address the anomalies currently inherent in the Child Support Scheme so that both parents share an equitable burden of the cost of supporting their children after marriage breakdown.</PARA>
<PARA>When I was trying to get an inquiry into the Family Law Act I thought the child support scheme should have been included in that inquiry. The Attorney-General at the time, Michael Duffy, talked me out of it, and I can now see why. This was a big inquiry in itself, even compared with the Family Law Act inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as this inquiry is concerned, history now records that 1,000-plus submissions were received for the family law inquiry, but they were but the tip of the iceberg of discontent. This inquiry broke all records for a parliamentary committee, with over 6,000 submissions documented. This alone is strong evidence of a system that is in chronic need of review. This disquiet was further confirmed by the committee's hotline, which logged an estimated 150,000 calls over two days and that is quite an amount of concern in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is both an historical document and a progressive agenda for reform. It cannot be adopted overnight, but I hope the government will demonstrate some genuine commitment to relieve some of the more obvious inequities in the present system. It has to be said that there are no absolutes in relation to child support. It has been suggested that the issue is the balance point between separated and intact families, between children of first and subsequent families, between custodial and non-custodial parents, and between parents and taxpayers generally. That sums up precisely the complexity of the problems with which the committee was confronted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I should record my sincere thanks to the secretariat, whose task has been long, onerous and stressful in writing this difficult report: Jane Vincent, who is the secretary now; before her, Robina Mills; Matthew Mason-Cox, who was taken on for a short period; David Wallace, the legal adviser who has been with us for a long time now; Susan Cardell; Lesley Cowan; and Debbie Devlin. I thank them for all the help they have given us in trying to get together this report and trying to help people out in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the 163 recommendations ought not to have been necessary had the federal government taken appropriate care when establishing the Child Support Agency. Indeed, recommendations 1 to 3 say in simple terms that the existing legislation is unreadable and needs to be rewritten so that it can be understood, that the government ought to find out why many custodial parents are not receiving child support and that the government needs to determine what it wants from the agency. The recommendations throughout the report highlight issues that are so basic to any government program, the wonder is that they have taken so many years to be identified. For example, recommendation 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Joint Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. that the CSA establishes, as a matter of priority, national policies and develops the necessary guidelines and manuals to ensure uniform practices are observed in all areas of the CSA administration and in accordance with the child support legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>People might well ask why manuals and guidelines were not in existence at the start of the scheme. They might well ask why uniform standards are today the subject of a recommendation to a government department that has been in existence for six years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee discovered that there is a strong notion that non-custodial parents, predominantly male, must be made to pay; and there is sufficient evidence to suggest that the system and the agency encourage that philosophy. The committee believes the government must adopt a more even-handed approach to child support and establish its priorities to ensure adequate support is made available to all children; that parents share the cost of child support according to their capacity to pay; and that Commonwealth government expenditure be limited to the minimum that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me that the need to reduce Commonwealth expenditure has, over time, forced unfair financial constraints on parents, especially the non-custodial parent. The committee was provided with ample evidence of this many times. Part of this, I believe, is the inappropriate location of the Child Support Agency within the Australian Taxation Office. To my mind, the philosophy and administration of the child support scheme should more appropriately lie within the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think it was interesting to observe the formal arms-length approach both the Child Support Agency and the Department of Social Security took to their child support responsibilities. Some staff within the Child Support Agency appear to have developed a persona of considering clients as an obstruction to their work: custodial parents were whingers and non-custodial parents were tax dodgers. The committee was told it was routine for certain officers to simply not answer phones for one morning a week to allow them to get on with the other administrative matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear to me that neither the DSS nor the Child Support Agency had any real concept that they ought to be providing a service&mdash;I repeat: service&mdash;for people. Indeed, it was almost outside their job description. Astonishingly, those departments believe on balance their operations to have been at the least adequate. The Child Support Agency quoted in evidence its success rate at raising the amount of maintenance that is now paid comparative to what was paid prior to its establishment, but even that argument basically, I believe, is flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Social Security was similarly satisfied, although it had sufficient modesty, I would say, to acknowledge that there were problems with the scheme. In the report we noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . despite departmental assertions to the contrary, particularly from the Department of Social Security, it was clear to the Committee that there were significant problems with both the Scheme itself and the operations of the CSA.</PARA>
<PARA>The report is possibly not as critical of the government agencies as I would personally have preferred. Having established there are problems, it is important that we now find workable and effective solutions. The committee makes a number of recommendations that place enormous demands on the Child Support Agency&mdash;an office clearly lacking in staff resources and training to cope with the task that it was assigned. I am not convinced that under existing financial constraints the agency has the capacity to respond to what we have proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee makes many recommendations that ought to have been part of the original establishing guideline. For example, there are no appropriate training strategies, no proper office procedures, no real understanding of the needs of the agency's clients, and no true understanding of the rights and responsibilities of both service provider and client, and staff of the Child Support Agency had little appropriate phone counselling techniques and no understanding of the need to identify themselves and to involve themselves with any particular client to provide continuity. In fact, the committee felt so concerned about this aspect that we specifically recommended that `the CSA introduce dedicated case officers, with assigned responsibility and accountability for individual clients'. I think that is an absolute must because that was repeated to us many times by the clients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee makes further recommendations in respect of recruitment of staff with experience and qualifications in client service oriented disciplines so that the current Tax and Finance oriented staff culture is changed. The committee also highlighted evidence of quite inappropriate and discriminatory time frames for lodgment of forms and appeals. There was sufficient evidence to suggest that Child Support Agency clients have frequently been given incorrect advice and had unfair time constraints placed on them. We heard and read ample evidence to suggest there has been little or no attempt to develop appropriate work ethics in the Child Support Agency and there has never been any real attempt to provide understanding and genuine commitment to assist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many faults in the current system and many proposals for change. Whether the committee will ultimately be successful in its quest to improve the existing system, only time will tell. The regret is that it has taken six years, several government reports and now this report to propose change; and if we do not start now, the task will simply get harder. There have been obvious savings in social security outlays since introduction of the scheme, but if that savings success is at the expense of the non-custodial parents who are literally going bankrupt meeting their maintenance commitments the scheme cannot be said to be operating effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the treatment of clients by the Child Support Agency, an enormous number of complaints about the scheme were formula related. That has been mentioned by many people. Senator Neal tried to explain it a moment ago, and it is pretty hard to explain. The majority of the non-custodial parents who wrote to the committee believe the formula is too harsh and inflexible and does not take into account such issues as second families, existing financial commitments or changes to income. Those are only just a few of the concerns that people had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the Department of Social Security, which was charged with the responsibility for modelling various formula changes, suggested that it could see no need for change. The committee did not agree with that and we have made a number of recommendations to repair the imbalance between custodial and non-custodial parents. We have made a number of other recommendations in respect of reassessments, departures, variations and revisions to bring more flexibility and equity into the system. There are recommendations relating to fringe benefits, money from business, superannuation contributions and other sources that to date have not been taken into consideration. While this will not eradicate all the complaints, it may well reduce them to more manageable levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, as I said at the beginning, it was a difficult subject to grapple with and my personal view is that it is beyond the ability of any one parliamentary committee, no matter how dedicated it or its secretariat is in wanting to achieve meaningful outcomes. It is damn difficult to get the proper result for everyone. I have grave concerns that what we have proposed is beyond the capacity of the departments involved and that, unless there is a major commitment to attitudinal change and a real desire by government to effect change, we will simply get more of the same tampering at the edges. That, I believe, just will not be good enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Child Support Agency is beyond minor repair. It is in need of major surgery. Whether the government is up to the task, we will wait and see. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

There has been a significant increase in the number of community and ethnic groups requesting meetings with the committee to put before it their concerns about human rights abuses in different parts of the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also took evidence at some twenty public hearings from a range of people and organisations, including Amnesty International; Mr Brian Burdekin, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner; the Hon.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also responded to an invitation by the town clerk of the Daguragu Community Government Council, Mr Alan Harris, to visit the Aboriginal communities at Pigeon Hole, Kalkaringi-Daguragu and Mistake Creek in the Northern Territory to examine the conditions at these particular settlements. The committee believed it was important that Australia should look closely at its own record, and not be complacent, and I do not believe we are, as far as our own people are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Harris, in his submission to the committee, listed problems of poor housing, low health standards and unemployment as failures of Australia to meet its obligations under the Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and other international instruments. Chapter seven of this report deals with the visit to these communities in detail. We noted in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The gap between theory and practice and the complexity of the challenge facing Australians in delivering the whole range of human rights to its citizens was made obvious to the committee on its visit to the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also noted that to make assessments about the standard of living of Aboriginal people across the country or to make judgements about potential solutions for the particular problems being experienced and being faced by these communities is not possible within the terms of reference or the resources of this committee. However, in looking at the substandard conditions that certainly existed in these communities, it is clear that despite the effort and considerable amount of money that has been placed in Aboriginal affairs the problem in the distribution of funds remains acute. The committee also noted that, while the discrepancy in standard of living between our indigenous people and the rest of the community remains so wide, Australia will have a problem in claiming any satisfaction in meeting its obligations totally under the international human rights treaty regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from the visit, the committee made a number of recommendations. These ranged from a very basic request that the problems associated with the septic systems at Pigeon Hole be fixed by the responsible agency and that ATSIC report back to the committee about the conditions of those systems as a matter of urgency to more policy oriented recommendations, such as community house management schemes with in-built training being developed in remote communities. Also, the committee should report regularly on Australia's obligations to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is some 235 pages in length, excluding appendices, and deals with far too many issues for me to hope to cover all of them in the brief time available to me this evening. However, I would like to make some general observations about the structure of the report and the approach taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report starts with several chapters that deal with the developments in the legal framework of human rights. Chapter one is an overview of human rights in 1993-94, providing an update on developments such as the World Conference on Human Rights held in Vienna in June 1993. It also comments on human rights at the international level, regional level and then at the national level. As an initiative to develop regional understanding on human rights matters, the committee recommends that the government explore with regional countries the possibility of establishing a dialogue on human rights through regular ministerial meetings with the foreign ministers&mdash;and other ministers as appropriate&mdash;of the APEC countries and through regular contacts between the human rights commissions of the regional countries involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter two deals with the United Nations and discusses such issues as proposals for the reform of the UN, funding for human rights, the structure of UN committees, new covenants and conventions and the status of the various human rights conventions in Australia. It concludes by examining the role of Australia's Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It recommends that the government reinstates the regular human rights reports from all Australian diplomatic posts and makes provision in resources and training for officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to carry out this task. Let there be no doubt, Australia is an international citizen of good standing. We contribute, and we contribute regularly and widely to improving international understanding. We do have obligations and we do honour our undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter three examines the Australian human rights framework, in particular the role of the federal parliament and the role of the states respectively. It goes on to examine the impact of treaties on the federal-state distribution of powers. The vital question of a bill of rights is also discussed in detail. The key recommendation is for an inquiry into the potential for a bill of rights to be adopted in Australia to guarantee human rights standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter four examines aid, trade and human rights. The committee believes that there is a linkage between aid, trade and human rights but that aid should not necessarily be made conditional on the human rights record of a recipient country. Among the committee's recommendations is one that AIDAB include a human rights impact statement in all development assistance project proposals and that all Australian political parties make a recommitment to attaining the United Nations target of development assistance reaching 0.7 per cent of GDP. On these issues, again, we should not be in any doubt. Concerted international action is required, particularly in the field of poverty alleviation. International coordination and cooperation is necessary, given the scale of the problems that exist in some parts of the world in the post-Cold War period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my time is short, I will confine my remarks to the remaining nine chapters and simply say that they deal with a specific theme: peacekeeping, the rights of indigenous people, of workers, women and children, asylum seekers and, finally, with specific cases of human rights abuses that were raised with the committee. On peacekeeping, there is no question that Australia's record is very proud. There is no question also that we have a greater role to play in the region in terms of developing the standards for peacekeeping forces generally. There is no question that the experience in Bosnia demonstrates the value of having a political settlement in place before the peacekeeping force arrives. I believe the report deals with issues, such as the ones I have mentioned, in a very balanced and fair manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties we faced as a committee was that we simply did not have the resources to investigate, in any real sense, allegations of human rights abuses. While we attempted to corroborate views put forward by various ethnic groups, for example, by seeking supporting evidence and documentation from reputable international organisations, in many cases it was only possible to indicate what a particular submission said about a situation. It is important to understand that this report is not meant to be an encyclopedic review of the international human rights situation, but rather to illustrate, albeit in a fairly condensed form, the types of problems affecting people around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pay tribute here to the members of the human rights subcommittee who worked so hard and so tirelessly during this long inquiry. Human rights is a very emotive and challenging area, and people have differing views on how human rights in the broader sense might best be promoted and protected. It was notable, and remains notable, that all members of the subcommittee worked in a non-partisan fashion in examining the issues raised. We made great attempts to reach a consensus on issues wherever possible. I would like to thank each of my colleagues on the committee for their assistance&mdash;in particular Senator Baden Teague, the deputy chair, and his predecessor, Mr Michael MacKellar&mdash;for their support and their contribution to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The support of members of the subcommittee was at all times helpful and constructive. I also thank the committee staff for their support and assistance on an ongoing basis, particularly the subcommittee secretary, Margaret Swieringa, who was an outstanding parliamentary officer. I thank all the staff for their efforts in providing such a high level of service during the inquiry. Too often, some in the parliament seek mere temporary partisan advantage. The human rights subcommittee tends to take the opposite view of looking for bipartisan conclusions and taking into consideration the depth of the recommendations that result from that bipartisanship or non-partisanship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make some brief comments on Australia's record in the human rights area. Australia is to be commended for many of the initiatives it has taken with regard to human rights observation. For example, at the world conference on human rights in Vienna in June 1993, Australia proposed that each state be encouraged to develop a national action plan which would identify the steps by which that state would improve its promotion and protection of human rights. Australia then led the way in developing such an action plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's record on the ratification of human rights treaties is formidable. There are few reservations left on existing treaties. However, in the process of signing and ratification, there has been only intermittent parliamentary debate or scrutiny. The committee believes that there is scope for improvement here and that a case can be made for greater parliamentary discussion at different levels of treaty making along the lines recently suggested by the foreign minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's commitment to human rights, already widely supported in the community, should be further enhanced by refined and improved processes at all levels of government, in the parliament and in non-government organisations. We seek to bind and refine these processes by way of the delivery of this report so as to maximise the observation of human rights standards and the maintenance of the strictures set by international instruments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat the committee's firmly held belief that continuous, open and free dialogue and debate between nations on human rights issues must be maintained. The structures which facilitate that debate need to be developed further and improved where they already exist. Australia as a nation, and this parliament as a body, as part of the democratic process should continue to do all we can to reduce and, hopefully over time, eliminate the gap between the ideal and the reality as far as human rights standards are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, there is no question that the past 50 years have seen great advances. We have a very long way to go. This country has been part of the progress on human rights standards on every occasion. That is a very proud record. The committee recognises it, but it also recognises the flaws that still need to be addressed and the appalling circumstances that still need to be highlighted. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank my colleagues. As deputy chairman of the human rights subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I am proud to follow and support the remarks of Senator Loosley, the chairman of the committee. He has given an excellent summary of a very important parliamentary report. I do not know any member of the current parliament who has made a greater contribution and shows such diligence with regard to human rights anywhere in the world. I say that after spending many days on this inquiry and many hours carefully differentiating between the paragraphs and style of the 63 recommendations in the 13 chapters of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concert with many other members of parliament who have worked together in this non-partisan way, I repeat the words of Senator Loosley: we have sought to agree, wherever possible, on the basis of sound evidence and good judgment. In the writing of this report, I mention the cooperation of my very good friend Ian Sinclair of the National Party and other good friends, such as Michael MacKellar, who preceded me as deputy chairman of the subcommittee; Senator Vicki Bourne from the Australian Democrats, who, as I recall, attended every meeting; Senator Denman, who is in the chamber; and others, such as Senator Harradine and Senator Reynolds. I pay particular tribute to Margaret Swieringa, whose professional work was and is outstanding. She has been associated with this committee for a number of years now. As has been noted, this is the second comprehensive report about human rights in the world. In each parliament, we see an update on it by a further comprehensive report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The good spirit and merit of the argument, being the basis of our discussion, were as evident in preparation of this report by this subcommittee as any I have experienced in another committee of the parliament. I hope that that approach will continue for the good of human rights everywhere in the world and where we have influence on human rights within this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This topic is at the heart of our concerns for the wellbeing and best advantage of every person in the world, including Australia. It has implications for a wide range of policy matters. For example, it touches upon the Australian constitution and whether there ought to be a bill of rights. I happen to be not convinced that it would be best to have a bill of rights, because I believe that defining the terms of a bill of rights creates the unintended consequence of restricting our rights to only the list that we happen to outline in this generation. I wish to reinforce the common law approach to a bill of rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another constitutional matter is treaties and their ratification. In a federal system such as Australia's, there are implications for the Commonwealth in entering into a treaty with the states. I am glad to see, along with a discussion of the formulations of this report, that the Australian government has given notice that it wishes to take the parliament into its confidence and to table drafts of various treaties at an early stage for discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights creates implications for the status of women and the rights and protections of children. There are concerns with regard to nursing homes, the care of those who are mentally ill and the care of minorities. The situation of the Aboriginal people of Australia, especially in remote areas, has been rightly referred to by Senator Loosley. One of the highlights of this inquiry was our visiting the Gurindji people in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to the chapter that relates to the concerns that Aboriginal and other Australians express with regard to ensuring that, when talking about human rights around the world, we get human rights right in this country. As Senator Loosley said, there is certainly no room for complacency, irrespective of whether we look at the world at large or areas of concern in Australia. The quote on the front page of the report&mdash;`between the idea and the reality falls the shadow'&mdash;is an apt set of words by T.S. Eliot which reinforces that we should not be complacent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Human rights is at the heart of the most difficult agenda items for the international community. The United Nations and all regional discussions that relate to the relationship between nations will, for all of our lifetime, include on the agenda the question of human rights. We need to be sensitive to understand the cultural context in which people from other countries express human rights. However, we should never forsake the foundational commitment that there are international standards in human rights expressed in precise words by treaties in the United Nations to which an overwhelming number of countries have subscribed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should not regard those treaties as in any way approximate, hollow or other than what they are&mdash;precise principles, precise undertakings that nations have made to uphold these commonly expressed international standards in human rights. But the interpretation as it relates to particular developments within a country needs to take place on the basis of good information and sensitive dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think especially about the nation of China, the two parliamentary inquiries that have visited that country and their reports to this parliament about the different initial statements that China makes with regard to human rights&mdash;that is, very basic priority commitments to food, shelter, clothing, good order, and freedom from criminal or other dangers. I say to my friends in that country that we hear with sensitivity the priority initial statements about human rights; nevertheless, we insist upon the international standards of human rights that that country has agreed to and we say that it is possible to do more than one thing at once. It is possible not only to take action with regard to the priority fundamental or introductory statements in the Chinese expression of human rights, but also to go on and achieve substantial rights for people such as were transgressed during the Cultural Revolution, such as are offensive to the Chinese government and the Chinese people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this example of China as one that I believe will be for some years on the agenda of our bilateral discussions and, indeed, the international discussion of human rights. I refer also to the judgment that has to be made politically as to whether or not any of those elements of human rights concerns are in any way linked to trade sanctions or any other elements that touch upon the relationship between countries. I happen to be of the view that it is in many cases the best political judgment that there not be a direct linkage between achieving the objectives of human rights concerns and trade access. The linkage can be counterproductive and can have unintended consequences. We need to be very wise politically in the way in which we take forward our human rights concern in concert with all the other relations between countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude at this point by referring to the chapters that relate to a number of countries. We have mentioned Kenya and the Lebanon; we have mentioned Indonesia and a number of other countries neighbouring Australia. We have mentioned Cambodia. The committee listened carefully to the UN's rapporteur on human rights in Cambodia, Justice Michael Kirby. Each country needs to be dealt with wisely and carefully but with firmness, resolve and the kind of non-partisan unanimity that we see in this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw attention to only one of the recommendations in the report&mdash;not one that I have reservations about, otherwise I would have put in even a paragraph of statement. But it is appropriate that I note that in discussion there was a lot of give and take on various issues but there was one matter that related to concerns about Tibet and the need for a women's delegation to be properly heard at the forthcoming women's conference in Beijing. I note that where there is a sovereign country, China, that has some refugees, such as those from Tibet who are in north India, who have developed views that include a call for independence for Tibet from China, it may be with some considerable reluctance that China does not admit a delegation of such refugees to attend an international women's conference. It would certainly be generous and very courteous of China to allow that to occur. Yet if it does not, I am sure that, as the committee has recommended, the Australian delegation and all other delegations should rightly listen to any minority group's concerns, including the concerns of these minority peoples who otherwise would not be represented and, judging what is appropriate, make statements that bring justice in any international conference such as the forthcoming one in Beijing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish it to be inferred from the finding on that matter that we are insisting that there be carte blanche for a refugee group to write the agenda for Australia's delegation as to what they say on their behalf in an international conference. I am sure that was never intended. But I say that in some detail with regard to one country because we are, of course, addressing the particular concerns of each of the countries mentioned, and others besides, in our bilateral discussions with that country and in a number of other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank those who have allowed me to speak, as deputy chairman of the committee, immediately after the chairman in this debate. With regard to East Timor, I have very real concern that the government of President Soeharto in Jakarta give the ability for a dialogue for constitutional reform in the province of East Timor, so that East Timor, whilst remaining within Indonesia, is given such a level of autonomy that matters of dispute about culture, religion and the freedom of the people to develop in a most prosperous way, can be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently met with the Governor of East Timor. I am aware of the views of Bishop Belo and other spokespersons for the minority peoples of Indonesia on this matter. I believe it is time that human rights in East Timor is much more guaranteed by allowing a political process in that province that would define a more sound basis for autonomy within Indonesia, that will allow groups warring with each other or at odds to come together in a democratic political process that brings security and prosperity to that troubled part of our near neighbour, Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a wide range of other comments that we could make about individual countries. I commend this report to the parliament. I note that the chairman will be speaking at the National Press Club tomorrow. I look forward to attending his address and I look forward to the next parliament having a similar report thoroughly researched. I note that there will be particular inquiries with regard to certain parts of the world&mdash;certain nations&mdash;and specific problems such as a current inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into the situation in Burma. To go back in history, one of the foundation human rights reports of this parliament, one that was in my first year in parliament in 1978, was the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade&mdash;then called the joint foreign affairs and defence committee&mdash;on human rights in the Soviet Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report was very particular to one nation. It happened to have the unanimous support of its members. It was very well received in this parliament. It was so accurate that it is still now, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, seen to be one of the most credible descriptions of the political and human situation in that former union which so transgressed human rights that it led those people to explode in a constitutional development which saw the end of that country and its breakup into the series of the current republics that we know. We have a proud record in this parliament of writing about human rights, and this report is certainly a very worthy addition. </PARA>

I have no doubt as Senator Loosley has said and confirmed by Senator Teague that the committee laboured mighty hard.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the report which attracts my interest and relates to a submission I made to the joint standing committee is on the impact of treaties on Australia. The report makes some useful comments. It shows, as I have been attempting to demonstrate now for some 12 months in this parliament and elsewhere, that there are serious problems with Australia's treaty making procedures. As this government has shown an enormous enthusiasm for treaties, it is quite appropriate as these treaties start to have an impact on Australia that we in this parliament and the wider community start to think more carefully about the processes by which this government goes about signing treaties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report recognises that there are some problems in this area, but I wish to highlight a number of areas where I think the report does not go far enough and fails to tackle what I see as fundamental issues. The part of the report which I am perhaps least impressed with is a discussion relating to the impact on the sovereignty of this nation of international treaty making activities. I refer to paragraphs 2.30 and 2.31 where the report argues that there is not a major problem with the sovereignty of this nation and international treaty making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not accept that, in many ways we do not accept that there has to be important reform in the parliament. I wonder what is the point of the committee arguing that the nation's sovereignty is well protected by current arrangements when the earlier report referred to by Senator Loosley which was tabled in December 1992 and entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to protect and promote human rights</EMPHASIS> conceded that there is a sovereignty problem. We had the earlier Schacht report arguing:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the recognition at the outset of the principle of the `sovereign equality' of all peace-loving states, there has been a tendency for the United Nations to limit national sovereignty. This evolution, therefore, increasingly demands a reconsideration of the principle of national sovereignty. United Nations conventions, now covering a wide range of activities, inevitably change the character of domestic institutions, affect domestic legislation and extend accountability&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress `extend accountability'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">beyond the usual domestic constituency. This extension of international accountability is not without its tensions or accusations of unwarranted intrusions into the internal affairs of countries.</PARA>
<PARA>Whereas the Loosley report tends to be pretty dismissive of the issue of sovereignty, the Schacht report conceded that there was an issue. What is the point of not tackling this issue when just some weeks ago Sir Ninian Stephen in the Sir Earle Page Memorial Trust lecture highlighted what he saw as the most fundamental change in law in this country since he graduated from university. He indicated that it was the impact of international law on domestic institutions. The speech was titled, `The expansion of international law&mdash;sovereignty and external affairs.'

He predicts failure for what he calls the "interdependence" movement and concludes that "why nations that will fight to the death to prevent surrendering their sovereignty to a conqueror would voluntarily surrender it to a supranational bureaucracy or a global elite of financiers and industrialists is a mystery that interdependence theorists have yet to explain".</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;People can contrast Sir Ninian's views with the views expressed in the committee. I do feel it was a great pity that the committee failed to grapple with this important issue. No-one doubts that Australia, as a member of the international community, will have to partake extensively of treaty making activity, but the question is: how should this be conducted, and how should it protect the democratic rights of citizens of this country? Sir Ninian speaks about a democratic deficit in relation to treaty making activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a pity that this particular committee did not come to grips with this problem but tended to be dismissive. If we are dismissive of the problem, therefore it makes it more difficult to address the fundamental issues such as: what role should this parliament have in relation to treaty making activity? What role should the states have? What is the process of consultations with Australians? If we are worried about human rights, we are worried about the rights of Australians and the human rights of ordinary Australians to determine the laws which affect them. Therefore, it seems to me that this committee above all should have shown a bit more courage in addressing this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sir Ninian Stephen is not a member of the League of Rights. He is not renowned as a fanatic. Sir Ninian sees a problem with sovereignty. He sees a democratic deficit problem in relation to treaty making activity and he points our attention to the fact that other nations have been more effective in protecting their component parts than Australia has. If this committee is going to address treaty making and the roles of states, why did it shy away from the sort of analysis that Sir Ninian pointed us to?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I accept that this committee has shown some movement. For example, honourable senators would be aware that there has been quite a bit of debate in this chamber and elsewhere about the procedures of UN human rights committees. Paragraph 2.30 in the committee's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this committee believes that the principles of natural justice should be incorporated into the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the proceedings of UN human rights committees. No-one would argue with that, but it is a pity that the committee did not assert that point more firmly in reaching its conclusions. It is true that it recognised that reform of the UN Human Rights Committee needs to occur and there is a recommendation to that effect. But the reform directs our attention to the independence of members of that committee from their governments. It points to a number of other procedural changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It did not strongly assert&mdash;as honourable senators would expect a human rights committee above all to assert&mdash;that natural justice should apply to these proceedings; that is, that it is the right of all defendants so described to appear, that hearings, where appropriate, should be held in public and that there be cross examination of witnesses&mdash;the sorts of things that we take for granted in this country. I regret that the committee shied away from this. I have to say that it went significantly further in conceding that there was a problem in this area than the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) was ever prepared to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome that but, in my view, on that particular issue it simply did not bite the bullet with the facts staring it in the face. If people expect these committees to have a role in our legal system, it seems to me that the onus is on the committees to make sure that their procedures and membership meet Australian standards. I think the report shows that, regrettably, these committees simply do not meet Australian standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I wish to comment briefly on is the role of the states in the treaty making activity. The government has tended to pretend that everything in this garden is pretty rosy and that extensive consultations occur with the states before treaties are signed. Of course, we know of some quite infamous cases where that did not happen. Just before the last election we saw a rash of treaty making activities which would cause concern to anyone interested in human rights and proper procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report illustrates, in an interesting manner, the problems which have occurred in the area of consultation with the states. I think this is a very valuable part of the report. Whereas Senator Evans and the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) ceaselessly assure us that everything is all right, this report points to very real problems in this area. It  recommends that parliament should have a greater role in treaty making activity. Recommendation 12 calls for:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the further streamlining of the processes of the Commonwealth/State Standing Committee on Treaties to improve the collection and dissemination of information between line departments and the coordinating agency at both the State and Commonwealth levels . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation 13 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee strongly endorses the move to inform the Parliament at an early stage in the treaty making process by tabling treaties in the Parliament before signature and recommends that the Minister for Foreign Affairs should use the forum of the Parliament to raise international human rights issues.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is good, and it is certainly a help. But it does not consider to any great extent the argument of whether the  parliament should establish, for example, a treaties committee to examine more controversial treaties which are brought before the parliament, and it does not consider to any great extent whether parliament should have a legislative or veto role in relation to treaties. I think that is a pity. </PARA>

Honourable senators will be interested to read the evidence that was given by Senator Evans to the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee on Tuesday, 29 November.

The idea is to provide information to parliament about the treaties.

<PARA>This committee has correctly seen the need to more appropriately involve parliament. I stress that the committee's recommendation is for the treaty to be laid on the table before signing.

The people who put the report together probably thought the recommendations were in line with the new spirit of consulting parliament that they saw coming from Senator Evans and Mr Lavarch. I have to say that the Evans and Lavarch statement has turned out to be a damp squib. Senator Evans has pulled back from the spirit that he attempted to convey to the press at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make relates to the issue of sovereignty. Paragraph 2.31 of the committee's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The independence and sovereignty of the nation state is preserved at a number of stages in the process. The state chooses to be bound by the treaty, it chooses to respond to the assessment of the committee and it also chooses the remedy it will apply, appropriate to its domestic legal or social framework.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee points to where there has been a treaty breach. Under international law, a country in breach of its international obligations is required to rectify that breach. Sir Ninian Stephen also addressed this issue in his speech. He spoke about the view that Australian sovereignty is protected because parliament must pass enacting legislation; in other words, we can go away and ratify the treaty, but do not worry, because parliament still has a role&mdash;it must pass the enacting legislation. Sir Ninian said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The doctrine familiar to English law, though not applied in the US or in most continental legal systems, that treaties entered into by the executive do not have effect as law of the land unless implemented by legislation, may be thought to mitigate the absence of parliamentary consultation. The doctrine was an outcome of England's 17th century constitutional settlement, reflecting the desire to limit prerogative power and, in particular, the power of the crown to change the law of the land by a mere exercise of that prerogative. However its mitigating effect is reduced by the fact that, once the executive ratifies a treaty, so that the State becomes a party to it, the legislature will have little option but to enact any necessary enabling legislation; not to do so would be tantamount to repudiation, a failure to honour the country's international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>I make that point to show that&mdash;with some of the real intellectual challenges in treaty making, with the appropriate processes as we approach the 21st century, and because we have a government which has shown enormous enthusiasm for international treaty making&mdash;it is a pity that the sort of analysis Sir Ninian laid down just some weeks before this report was tabled was not effectively addressed in this report. That is why I believe that in some areas the recommendations simply do not go far enough in relation to the treaty making processes and the role of UN human rights committees. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's seventh report of 1994 deals with the proposed construction of a new laboratory complex at DSTO Salisbury, SA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSTO Salisbury is located 22 kilometres north of Adelaide. It accommodates DSTO's Electronics and Surveillance Research Laboratory which primarily undertakes research into electronic-based Defence systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present research facilities are spread over one thousand hectares and six hundred and fifty buildings, many of which were constructed for the manufacture of explosives in 1940.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the Committee involves concentrating DSTO research activities into a two hundred and eighty hectare site and provide a new laboratory complex which will accommodate five hundred and forty five research and support staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has recommended that the project proceed at an estimated out-turn cost of $50.714 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that facilities at DSTO Salisbury represent a substantial investment by the Commonwealth and occupy a much larger than necessary site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee notes that arising from the Defence White Paper there will be no change to the direction in which DSTO is proceeding nor will there be a change in the need for the laboratory complex.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was advised some six weeks after the public hearing that the plans and drawings of the proposed complex presented to it at the public hearing had been changed. The Committee was extremely concerned about the changes which were made to the design and made its displeasure known to Defence officials at a subsequent meeting at which the background and the substance of the changes were discussed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concluded that the revised design represents a major departure from the design originally submitted to the Committee by the Department of Defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst the Committee agrees that the revised design is an improvement, the circumstances surrounding the development of the original design lacked the rigorous analysis necessary for a special purpose building such as this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons the Committee has recommended that Defence should review procedures for the testing of schematic designs against user requirements to minimise changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has also recommended that the Department of Defence should consult with staff associations regarding the revised design and report to the Committee about these consultations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of the effectiveness of open plan offices in increasing productivity was raised by a number of staff associations during the public hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes the time has come for the Department of Defence to undertake or commission a study of the impact on staff efficiency and productivity of open planning and other forms of office accommodation. Other recommendations in the report deal with heritage matters, consultations with state and local governments and soil remediation of the greater Salisbury site.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I take the opportunity to say a few words about this particular report. I was deputy leader of the delegation, which was led by the Speaker, Mr Martin, and included Mr Harry Quick MP, the member for Franklin, Senator John Woodley from the Australian Democrats, and Bill Taylor, the member for Groom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our delegation to the Baltic states was the first parliamentary delegation to visit there since the states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania gained their independence. Whilst they may be old countries historically and have suffered many different regimes, Lithuania became an independent state in 1990 and the other two countries in 1991. As Australia was one of the first countries to recognise the independence of the Baltic states, it was most important that we showed in a more tangible way our support for their independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to express on behalf of the delegation our appreciation to the chairs and members of the Riigikogu, which is the parliament of Estonia, the Saeima, which is the Latvian parliament, and the Seimas, which is the Lithuanian parliament. They went out of their way to extend to us very generous hospitality. I am pleased to say that one of the things we did while we were there was to offer an invitation to members of their parliament to visit us here. I am pleased to say that at the end of this week I will be hosting a dinner for the President of the Estonian parliament, Mr Ulo Nugis, and the Speaker will be having a lunch for him. I am pleased to see that the Estonians have accepted our invitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to thank Anne Hazelton, our secretary, for the wonderful work that she carries out. She not only has to put the reports together but also has to act as a girl Friday for all the wants and needs of a delegation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our visit it was interesting to note the situation the three Baltic states are in after only two or three years of parliamentary democracy&mdash;having been through similar problems to all the other states of the former Soviet Union&mdash;and to see what has happened with the breakdown of communism. There are similar problems with all the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Being a farmer myself, I was interested to note that, with collective farming breaking up, the people were having tremendous problems trying to establish ownership of land and to get their small family farms operating again. There was certainly&mdash;to the casual observer, anyway&mdash;a noted lack of stock in the paddocks. I suspect that they have either been eaten or sold, or both, because of the conditions that have existed there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, we were very impressed with the advances and the pace with which those countries have moved since they have gained their independence. For instance, the Estonians are having elections in 1995. Their major concerns were the tensions between themselves and the state of Russia. They have a border dispute at the moment and they brought that forward to the IPU conference in Copenhagen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major concerns they have in Estonia is the issue of retired military personnel. It was an eye opener for all members of the delegation to visit a former military base that had been evacuated by the Russians only three days before. Not to put too fine a point on it, what was left was really a wasteland. It was a scene of total devastation. Everything that was nailed down was taken and everything that was not nailed down was taken&mdash;from taps to door handles. Even the culverts and pipes under the road were taken. Wash basins that we would not even consider using here were taken. Mirrors were taken off the walls. Everything that was of any basic use at all was taken. If they could have scraped the paint off the wall and taken it away, they probably would have. If that is any indication of the legacy of the Russian troop occupation&mdash;and I believe it is, because we heard similar stories in the other two Baltic states&mdash;and of what is left behind or not left behind, there is a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental damage was also occasioned by the occupying troops of the Soviet Union. For instance, in Estonia there were 570 military bases, so one can imagine the number of installations. When the occupying troops left, a lot of the officers retired. Up to 80 per cent of the Soviet forces stationed in Estonia were officers, and a lot of them have retired. Something like 10,500 retirees have been foisted upon the Estonian system. They are being paid a pension by the Russian government; nevertheless, it is causing some problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Likewise, the major problem in Latvia is that almost 50 per cent of the population is Russian speaking and is topped up with a lot of retired Russian military personnel. The parliament of Latvia has a preoccupation with what is going to happen with all these Russian speaking people. Will they form their own party and will they be subject to a similar situation they have been through? They, too, have the same problems we saw in Estonia, with the breakup of their farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has programs of exchange with Latvian parliamentary people. I am pleased to say that not only have we invited the President of the Saeima to send a parliamentary delegation to Australia, but also Harry Quick and I have invited a member of the Latvian Farmers Union to visit Tasmania, and I believe that invitation has been accept ed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Lithuania, the problem with ex-Russians is not so great. Only 8.5 per cent of the population is Russian speaking. Lithuania was the first Baltic state to gain independence. We all remember the vivid scenes of confrontation culminating in the killing of 13 people by Soviet forces at the Vilnius television tower. We visited that site and it was a most moving experience. We also visited the Drobe woollen mill, which processes some 400 tonnes of Australian wool per year and is getting a lot of assistance from our technology. I was very impressed with that particular mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were inspired by a living skills centre in Vilnius for children with intellectual and multiple disabilities. It was established primarily through the efforts of two Lithuanian-Australian women and funded largely by the Lithuanian community in Australia. It is a model for other centres that may open in the Baltic states. Until the centre was opened, the children were regarded as idiots; they were drugged and lived in appalling conditions. It was through the efforts of these two women&mdash;Dana Baltutis and Gaila Muceniakas, who are from South Australia&mdash;that this centre was started. We were most impressed with what they had achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to again meeting the President of the Estonian parliament later this week. I hope that the very good links that exist between Australia and the Baltic states continue. After all is said and done, Australia was one of the first countries to recognise the independence of the Baltic states. While trade is growing from a low base, it is becoming reasonably important. The Baltic states are looking to us for support through the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 92nd Inter-Parliamentary Conference was held in Copenhagen. Here again, I believe our delegation was very successful. At the previous conference in Paris, the Australian delegation had flagged a supplementary agenda item, but we were unsuccessful in having it included. In Copenhagen we were successful in having included on the agenda a supplementary item concerning the implementation of commitments agreed to in the Uruguay Round of the multilateral trade negotiations. Given the debate on this particular matter this week, it is important for me to mention that our delegation was successful in getting substantial motions moved  through the Inter-Parliamentary Union which were carried unanimously by 123 countries. Basically, they called on all these countries to ratify the agreements and to get moving as quickly as possible. The Speaker and I both spoke on these particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, the IPU also organises very important meetings for women parliamentarians. I am pleased to say that Kathy Sullivan, who has played a leading role for women parliamentarians in the IPU, attended under her own steam and did a great job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hon. Clyde Holding represented us on the Human Rights for Parliamentarians Committee. He was obliged to attend as a substitute member at very short notice. He is held in very high regard by all countries and has a great knowledge of the abuse of human rights of parliamentarians around the world. I am quite surprised to learn that there are 88 former and serving parliamentarians in 14 countries who are either subject to disenfranchisement or are actually in gaol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that I was elected as a vice-chairperson of the Committee on Parliamentary, Juridical and Human Rights Questions. I will have to wait until the next conference to find out what that entails but at least it means that I will have something tangible to contribute, I hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has happened before, the delegation took the opportunity to become part and parcel of the Asia-Pacific group and to use our influence with members of that group, as well as with the 12+ group. One of the major parts of the conference was the election of a president for the next four years. I can tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you think a lot of lobbying for positions goes on around this place, the contest between Dr Sorour from Egypt and Mr Valdes Subercaseaux from Chile was likened to the election of the head of the United Nations. That is really what the IPU is, the United Nations of politicians. When the announcement was made, and Dr Sorour was successful, the Muslim countries, at least, were overjoyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am looking forward to continuing my work&mdash;as is, I presume, the Speaker&mdash;at the 93rd conference to be held in Madrid.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an enormous interest in our delegation in Europe. There was a lot of concern about APEC and where that was heading but a great awareness of the opportunities for using Australia as a gateway to Asia, as long as the government's attitude on tax and industrial relations does not preclude European companies setting up headquarters in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The European Union is at an absolutely fascinating stage of its development, with the widening of the European Union that is currently occurring and the discussions about extending its reach into European decisions and legislation. It is critical that Australia remains actively focused upon Europe and does not become blindly obsessed with the opportunities that exist in Asia. Europe remains our biggest trading partner&mdash;something that many of us forget&mdash;and it would be a tragedy if we did not keep our minds on the opportunities that present themselves in Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this trip, I am extremely optimistic about the opportunities for Australia in Europe. The economic liberalisation of Europe is tremendous and gives great cause for optimism about world trade and world economic progress. The major difficulty in Europe at the moment is the very high level of unemployment. This contrasts with the United States where the unemployment rate is only half that of Europe. Europe has a lot of work to do in liberalising its labour market in particular, as well as its product markets. It must take a lead from the United States if it is to overcome the problem of unemployment. I commend the report to the Senate and seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I would like to draw the attention of the Senate to one of the most critical problems facing rural Australia today. I am referring to the level of farm indebtedness to financial institutions, which stood at $17.3 billion as of June 1993, according to the latest ABARE farm survey. The combination of the worst drought this century and the aftermath of the recession with its crippling interest rates has led to unprecedented levels of rural debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Average farm business debt for Queensland farms currently stands at $181,000 for 1993-94 and the average farm business debt for farms Australia-wide stands at $126,000. Debt levels have dramatically worsened over the past six years. Figures supplied by the South West Financial Service show that in 1988 the average equity ratio in a property was 85 per cent. By 1994 average equity is down to 54 per cent. By a happy coincidence, Senator Collins is in the chamber. I would like him to listen to the views that were expressed by a group of people at the farm debt summit. He is getting it straight from the horse's mouth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation will only deteriorate with the latest Bureau of Meteorology reports that the drought is unlikely to break before autumn. The latest ABARE report on the effects of the drought states that the drought will result in a reduction in the net value of agricultural production of almost $3 billion for the 1994-95 year. The drought has also resulted in wheat production falling by more than 50 per cent&mdash;this year's winter wheat crop will be the lowest in over 20 years. We are now seeing wheat imports being given the go ahead for daily bread supplies. It is the first time this century that significant quantities of wheat for bakery supplies have been imported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interest rates are starting to take off again and further rises are anticipated. The recent one per cent rise in the official reserve cash rate acted to impose an additional debt payment of around $170 million on the farm sector. This rise effectively negated the $164 million drought relief package that Senator Collins pushed through the parliament. Further tax hikes have not been ruled out by the government, leading to speculation about the likelihood of a mini-budget. This all points to many more difficult months ahead for our drought-stricken rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social and economic impact of high debt levels and negative cash flows is simply not being addressed by the government. The government's drought package, which provided a drought relief payment to affected farmers, is a welcome short-term assistance measure for farm families, many of whom may not have had an income for up to four years. However, the industry assistance measures in the package, including the additional $25 million for RAS funding for drought exceptional circumstances, and the increases in RAS subsidies from 50 per cent to 100 per cent, are ultimately inadequate, because the fundamental problem of RAS's restrictive eligibility criteria, which precludes many farmers from accessing the funding, remain unchanged. Senator Collins has promised me, on numerous occasions, that he will be changing the eligibility criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the three elements involved in drought response&mdash;immediate assistance to affected families, industry assistance through the rural adjustment scheme and financial reconstruction&mdash;it is the financial reconstruction that is the most difficult to address. We are all waiting for the second part of the government's drought package in the hope that a long-term strategy encompassing such vital elements as tax incentives for farm storage and water facilities, and taxation and income equalisation deposits, will be included. I would like to take this opportunity to say to the government that, two months after its handing down of the drought package, it must now look at long-term farm viability strategies as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I attended a very effective debt summit at Capella in the central Queensland highlands. The purpose of the summit was to look at ways that primary producers and small business operators could restructure their debt burden. Over 150 people attended the summit, representing a broad cross-section of the community, including producers, small business operators and representatives from local government and financial institutions. The Capella branch of the Queensland Grain Growers Association made thoughtful recommendations regarding taxation incentives, which are essential to enable producers to return to profitability once the drought breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As put forward by the Capella branch, the taxation incentives that are most urgently needed include the availability of an investment allowance to encourage increased investment in modern plant, equipment and technology, and improved deductibility measures for self-reliance strategies such as water storage facilities. Improving tax arrangements to take into account producers' fluctuating and uncertain incomes was also raised at the summit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Revamping the existing income equalisation deposit scheme was designated and called for as a matter of high priority. The Capella branch also called for the existing income equalisation deposit scheme to be revamped as a matter of priority. Reforms to the IED scheme should encompass such provisions as no withholding tax; interest payable on total deposit; and being taxable at a relevant rate when brought back into the taxable income of that financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that what the participants of the Capella drought summit were calling for is, for the most part, simply a return to what used to be fundamental elements of the primary industry policy of the National-Liberal government when it was in power. Income equalisation deposits and taxation incentives for water and fodder storage are all measures that this Labor government in its 11 years in office has systematically stripped from the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1983 the government cut general depreciation allowances and abolished special depreciation allowances for on-farm fuel storage. That year it also scrapped the arrangements for tax averaging and increased the margin paid by farmers under the fuel freight subsidy scheme. Later that year the government abolished tax incentives on income equalisation deposits. The IED scheme was reinstated in 1989 but in a greatly diminished form. </PARA>

A machine dealership owner presented evidence about the decline in his industry as a result of the fluctuating fortunes of primary industry. He pointed out that in 1984 there were approximately 2,700 machinery dealers in Australia selling about 15,500 tractors per year. In great contrast this year there are about 700 surviving machinery dealerships selling around 5,500 tractors per year. This contradiction in the industry has led to a dramatic decline in employment. If each of the 2,000 dealerships that have gone out of business had employed 10 people, this would translate to 20,000 put off over the last 10 years in rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to this dealer, the only reason that his business has survived is that he and his wife have worked seven days a week and for as many hours a day as were required to sustain the business.

The submission of this machinery dealer highlighted vividly the extremely difficult circumstances that many rural small businesses have had to battle with throughout the drought years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks about a disturbing trend which is emerging in police services around the country. The trend is towards providing police, firstly, with more and more powers and then with more and more weapons. We have all been dismayed in recent times as members of the Victorian police force have been involved in shootings of mentally ill people as a direct result of a lack of alternative means of handling such people. The combination of insufficient training for police, whose duties should not involve being mental health professionals, and the ready availability of guns when police are on duty has resulted in a series of tragedies which show no signs of having ceased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of these tragedies, a great deal has been said about issuing police with `non-lethal weapons'. In particular, research has been conducted into using aerosol sprays based on the active ingredients in certain vegetables, particularly those in the pepper varieties. These so-called capsicum sprays are already used in other parts of the world, and there are strong indications that the term `non-lethal' should not be used in reference to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report available in the United States of America investigated the deaths of 30 people exposed to such sprays. The report concludes that the deaths were due to obesity, drug use and positional asphyxia. However, whether or not one agrees with the report's conclusions, it is obviously unacceptable that people should be put into a life threatening situation because they are exposed to police operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure all honourable senators would have seen film footage of police operations in which tear gas is used and would have noticed that there is a considerable amount of wind drift and random application involved with such chemicals. The same problems of ensuring that only those targeted are sprayed arise with capsicum sprays. It is in the very nature of a sprayed chemical that bystanders are in danger of being sprayed. I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the level of toxicity of the chemical component of such a spray. The chemical in question is capsaicin (8-methyl-n-vanillyl-6-nonenamide). Pardon my pronunciation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will ensure that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> gets the right spelling, and I apologise for my lack of ability to pronounce the chemical's name. This particular chemical in question is, when transported in bulk, handled only in wax-coated blocks. Workers involved in its preparation and shipment wear gas masks, body suits and gloves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my possession two reports on the capsicum sprays.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time of the last shooting of a mentally ill person by police in Victoria a senior police officer from the metropolitan police in London was interviewed on the ABC radio. The contrast between the approach in Victoria and that in England could not have been more marked. The English police officer spoke of police squads having special training in dealing with mentally ill people on the streets. The training was based on the notion of building sufficient trust between the police officers involved and the person. There was special mention of the police being trained to act in a non-threatening manner&mdash;speaking quietly and sitting on the ground so as not to pose a threat, especially if the person is armed. The focus was very much on reducing the individual's fear of his surroundings or of other people in the vicinity, as this is often the presenting problem which triggers an incident. I ask honourable senators to contrast that scenario with the situation of one or more police officers with revolvers raised and ready, shouting at a mentally ill person in the street to drop his knife, axe or whatever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want it felt here that I am in any way criticising police, who are placed in very invidious situations. I think the onus is on the community to ensure that police officers, who often are in very difficult situations of panic and anxiety by fear-inducing circumstances, are ill-equipped by their training to deal with those situations in the best manner possible to ensure not only that the individual is protected from harm but also that the capacity of them and any bystanders to experience harm is reduced. It is notable that the metropolitan police in England do not carry firearms under general duty conditions and, as the officer being interviewed said, `There is no push from the police or the community to change that situation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue is about a great deal more than police use of weapons, be they lethal or otherwise. There is a mood in our society which wants to run away from the problems which exist by the simple expedient of giving police more and more powers to deal with those who do not fit our ideas of acceptability. It is not only the mentally ill who have been deinstitutionalised without proper community facilities who are at risk here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same attitude exists towards young people who are homeless, jobless or both, people of other ethnic origins and our own indigenous people. As these groups are more and more denied access to the common wealth of our society and are allowed less and less of a voice where and when it matters to be heard, we leave it to the police to deal with them when they infringe on our notions of propriety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this in the police operations in Western Australia in which young people are denied their democratic right to congregate in public areas, and we have the wonderful euphemism that we are moving them on because they are in `moral danger'. We see in this move the ever increasing powers being handed to police to deal with such groups. The police are not intended to be, and should not be, used by the community in such a way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Victoria the government has amended the Crimes Act to increase on the spot fines. That may seem harmless enough until it is realised that to challenge such a fine requires a quite extraordinary presence of mind, command of English and a highly developed knowledge of one's legal rights. The amendments also have the effect of significantly shifting the onus of proof by requiring defendants to reveal their defence before a plea of not guilty can be entered. Similarly, police powers to require people to give their name and address to a police officer have been broadened and the rules concerning fingerprinting have been altered to reduce the rights of people apprehended by police. In fact, reasonable force can now be used where the person does not consent to being fingerprinted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent mass strip search of patrons at a night club does not give one much confidence that the police in Victoria will be reluctant to use powers given to them by the legislation. Similarly, in South Australia the changes to juvenile justice legislation have resulted in disturbing new powers which effectively put police officers in the position of being both the arresting authority and the judicial authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But neither can we simply say that these powers are obviously necessary because of increases in crime. There is nothing obvious at all about the crime waves which we are constantly told about. In fact, often these are beat-ups and generally serve electoral ambitions of political parties and vested interests, as we have witnessed time and time again in Western Australia with juvenile justice issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot say that these powers are constantly being requested by the police themselves. I commend the police commissioner in Western Australia, Mr Robert Falconer, for his recent comments about the limitations of policing. He pointed out that the debate in Western Australia about how many extra police each of the major parties would give if in power was really nonsense because such promises are not answers to the problem. The problems have to be addressed by the whole society, in the way people relate to each other, how they value each other and how they enable people to make contributions to the community. There are alternatives to weapons and sprays. We need to look at the training of police; we need to look very much at the modelling of appropriate social behaviour which they have in their power. To address problems in policing and crime with a bandaid, ad hoc approach is an invitation to produce different and possibly more serious problems later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We really do need to address a long-term view. In the long term, if we give police more weapons then those weapons may in turn cause problems by imitation. Do we really want to see our young people with the capacity, as outlined in the media, to use sprays when fighting with each other? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
