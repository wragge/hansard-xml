<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Leader of the Government in the Senate to the government's policy of boom and bust and the fact that our real interest rates are now as high as they were before the 1990 recession, and amongst the highest real interest rates in all OECD economies. I also refer to the fact that Dr Barry Hughes, Mr Keating's former economics adviser, believes that the four percentage point increase predicted by the markets will cause a recession in 1996. On behalf of the Australian people, I ask the minister: will he assure the Senate that interest rates will not rise by four percentage points in the next six months and that there will not be another recession before the government introduces its l-a-w tax cuts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is only one bust waiting to happen at the moment and that is right in the opposition party room. I can understand Senator Hill being a little discombobulated at the moment when his leader is on a 20 per cent satisfaction rating in one poll with a 69 per cent&mdash;soixante-neuf&mdash;dissatisfaction rating. I can understand Senator Hill being very disconcerted indeed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on a point of order, Mr President. The important issue facing this country at the moment is the government's economic policy. We went through the 1990s bust, we are now told that we are in a boom and we are about to go into the next downturn. The question relates to the government's deliberate policy of forcing up interest rates, which will only hasten that inevitability. I ask you, Mr President, on the question of relevance to ask the minister to answer the question that has been put to him rather than develop his own discursion.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that was a rather feeble little wind-up to the point of order from Senator Hill, and I can understand his depression. I would be feeling pretty depressed if I were him at the moment. Of course it is the case that official interest rates will continue to be adjusted as appropriate to reduce the risk of the economy overheating 12 to 18 months out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made it clear that we do understand the necessity, as any responsible government would, to take into account overall economic conditions and ensure that overheating of the economy does not occur. But the kind of approach that we have adopted, the kind of approach that we have already set in train, with the interest rate rises that have occurred so far, means that interest rates will not need to rise to the same extent as they have in past cycles. It is the case at the moment that interest rates are still relatively low. The official cash rate&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Alston can squawk his silly budgerigar head off, but it will not make any difference to the truth of the matter, which is as follows: the official cash rate and the three-month bill rates are substantially lower than their average levels over the past 20 years. Three-month bill rates are currently below their lowest rates recorded in the 1980s. Ten-year bond rates are still below the levels which prevailed through most of the 1980s. That is the truth of the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that both fiscal and monetary policy will need to be carefully kept under control. But the condition of the Australian economy at the moment is not an occasion for the kind of bearish, mauling attitude that has been taken by the opposition. It is an occasion to appreciate the scale of the recovery and the implications of that growth for those Australians who have been out of work and who badly want to get into work. It is a matter of appreciating that what we have at the moment is something that we wanted and that the opposition has been yelling and screaming that it wanted for months gone by.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only a few months ago that I can remember Mr Downer saying&mdash;a little after budget night, on 11 May&mdash;that the budget was based on enormously optimistic, quite unrealistic growth forecasts. On budget night, he said that the economic forecasts used in the budget, most notably the predictions of growth and investment, were simply heroic leaps of faith. This was a few months ago. Mr Costello said of investment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget's investment figures are crucial to the whole budget. If they don't come from the budget, the budget falls apart, the budget's in deep trouble.</PARA>
<PARA>There were doomsaying predictions that the government could not possibly meet its growth or investment targets. Both the growth and investment targets have been dramatically exceeded within a matter of months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is there any grace or willingness to acknowledge the significance of this growth, this almost zero inflation growth, inflation of less than two per cent? Is there any willingness to acknowledge the significance of this for the recovery of the Australian economy and for the jobs that people want? No, there is just doomsaying and naysaying from those opposite and the immediate attempt inevitably to tear down the achievement and make lousy, rotten, squalid political capital of it in order to take people's minds off their own desperate difficulties. They do not persuade anybody; they certainly do not persuade me.</PARA>

Can the minister provide further information on the findings of that survey?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to see that members of the opposition as well as Senator Burns are very interested in the franchising industry. I think senators opposite would be unaware of the fact that the franchising industry, as shown by this recent survey conducted by the ABS for my department, had an annual turnover in 1993-94 of $43 billion, employs 280,000 Australians, excluding the franchisees, and is obviously one of the major industries in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is growing at a rate of between 14 per cent and 17 per cent per annum, and since 1991 has grown by over 70 per cent. The survey showed that of 832 businesses thought to be franchising 555 were in a franchise arrangement. Seven out of eight franchises have been developed in Australia, and close to 20 per cent of these&mdash;which is a very commendable figure&mdash;are now into exports in the services area. People recognise from the leaked report that the export of Australian services offers the greatest potential of all, and franchising is no exception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disappointing figure in the survey showed that one in six of those surveyed was in litigation between franchisee and franchisor. It is disappointing to see such a high level of disputation. It equates with a lot of anecdotal information that I have been receiving as minister over the last 18 months about the level of disputation in the franchising industry. As a result, some months ago I established an independent review of the franchising code, which at the moment is a voluntary code. That was conducted by Mr Gardini. The report is now with the government and I expect to be able to release that early in the new year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that those in the franchising industry, particularly franchisees, have been raising is the need for a firmer regulatory arrangement to ensure that both sides of the industry&mdash;franchisors and franchisees&mdash;are protected when they sign contracts. This particularly goes to the issue of adequate disclosure of what is in the contract with the franchisor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that Mr Gardini has dealt with in response to many submissions. The ABS review confirms the anecdotal information that the level of disputation and litigation is much too high, which adds extra costs to this industry which I am sure all would wish could be avoided. The government recognises that this industry offers great opportunities for people to enter small business&mdash;</PARA>

Now that the company rate has been dropped to 33 per cent and the top personal rate is 47 cents in the dollar, has not this `whole host of tax avoidance devices' so mentioned come back into play?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot certainly started her question correctly. When we came to power we did inherit a leaky, creaky tax system that dribbled all over the place with tax avoidance and we have cleaned that all up, and that is in fact a monument to the tax reform achievements of this government. We reduced company tax down to the level of 33 per cent for economic competitive reasons. That puts Australia in the lowest area of taxing nations in the OECD&mdash;I think if we are not the lowest we are very close to being the lowest&mdash;and it certainly puts us in touch with Asian business tax regimes as well, particularly considering not just the tax rate itself but also the depreciation regime that we have. So they were the reasons for the reduction in company tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great reforms we made to the tax system as well was the imputation system&mdash;I think Senator Kernot would agree&mdash;where company tax is effectively a withholding tax for shareholders and when the dividends are distributed they will pay the full marginal personal tax rate of a full 47 per cent. That guarantees, I think, the system against leakage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot in her question, as I heard it, asked me whether there is an incentive in the system for professionals to incorporate as companies.

I indicate to the Senate that a package of bills is in fact due here shortly. Those bills pick up some areas where the Taxation Office believes that there is the potential for tax avoidance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister's statement on the environment made in December 1992 included a commitment that a purchasing target of 90 per cent for certain prescribed categories of paper products&mdash;including, for example, notepads, desk calendars and photocopy paper&mdash;is to be met by the end of the 1995-96 financial year. There has been a delay in developing the criteria for environmentally preferred paper which I had hoped the government would have been able to finalise earlier in the year. However, there is still sufficient time to allow a purchasing scheme to be put in place by the end of 1995-96. In the meantime, the interim voluntary arrangements which are in place for identifying paper products acceptable for inclusion in voluntary purchasing targets will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arriving at appropriate final criteria for environmentally preferred paper is proving to be extremely difficult. Ours is not a unique situation. Over the past two years the European Union has also attempted to develop environmental criteria for paper products and is encountering problems similar to those that the EPA is grappling with in Australia. The issues encompass matters such as forestry, employment, trade, energy, air and water emissions, recycling and wastes. I have taken the view that it is better to get this policy right rather than hurry the process. Representatives of the pulp and paper industry and key conservation organisations recently held promising meetings on these questions. Unfortunately, those discussions, although identifying some areas of agreement, have reached an impasse, but the EPA is working to negotiate a workable proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the Prime Minister's statement, significant changes have occurred within the Australian paper industry. The Pulp and Paper Manufacturers Federation of Australia has announced initiatives to achieve world-class utilisation of waste paper.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now turn to the second part of Senator Margetts's question. The sales tax concession on some, not all, products made from 100 per cent recycled paper was removed in June 1992&mdash;well before the Prime Minister's statement concerning environmentally preferred paper. The decision to remove the sales tax concession on 100 per cent recycled tissue paper, exercise books and paper bags was based on a 1991 report by the Industry Commission which questioned the effectiveness of the concession and identified a number of adverse effects. In September 1992 the government agreed to provide transitional assistance to certain recycled paper manufacturers that had made investments based on the sales tax concession. Transitional assistance was provided for three years, with any further assistance to be subject to review by the EPA. That review will be completed shortly.</PARA>

As I said, that was the government policy in 1991. To the great credit of the many effective Labor members in western Sydney who lobbied the government consistently on this issue, the government, in fact, upgraded that decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What was that interjection? Halfway around the world, therefore, it is of no interest to you. Yes, that would be right for those opposite. The government very warmly welcomes Ukraine's accession to the NPT, which took place yesterday in Budapest, not only for its own inherent significance in relation to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty but because, as Senator Devereux indicated in his question, it also enables now the entry into force of the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the implementation of which, together with START II, will wipe out 20 years of the nuclear arms race. That is the significance of what happened yesterday. We have a process now under way of wiping out the products of 20 years of the nuclear arms race.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Australian government firmly believe that the NPT should be extended indefinitely.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the other implication of yesterday's decision, it removes the last remaining obstacle under the Lisbon protocol to the START I treaty commencing into force.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because a question and answer may not anticipate debate on a matter on the notice paper under standing order 73(2), the question to a Senator is in effect confined to procedural matters not going to the merits of the relevant item on the notice paper. Such a question may, for example, relate to a senator's intention to bring on an item of business or the effect of certain circumstances on the currency or urgency of the item.</PARA>
<PARA>There are a number or precedents given for that. The advice continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The anticipation rule is not enforced strictly in relation to questions to ministers because of the wide scope of such questions and the large number of matters on the notice paper at any time. A question to a minister and an answer, however, may not directly anticipate discussion of a bill or other item of government business on the notice paper which is expected to be dealt with in the near future. As a question to a senator who is not a minister necessarily relates directly to an item on the notice paper, the anticipation rule is applied more strictly.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SENATOR REID'S QUESTION ON VIETNAM FLOOD RELIEF</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Reid asked yesterday about allegations of interference by the Vietnamese Government in flood relief being provided by the Unified Vietnamese Buddhist Church (UVBC) to areas of the western provinces badly affected by floods in October, and the arrest of some UVBC members as a result.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">While indicating yesterday that I was not aware of the particular circumstances to which Senator Reid referred, I undertook to look into them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Embassy in Hanoi is not able at the moment to supply any independent verification of the claims.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claims derive solely to date from a report of 6 November by the Vietnam Committee on Human Rights, an expatriate Vietnamese organisation based in Paris, highly critical of the Vietnamese Government and not all of whose reports of human rights violations in the past have proved to be accurate.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essence of that report was that on 5 November, a group of around 360 UVBC monks, nuns and their followers gathered in Ho Chi Minh City, with 10 vehicles, intent on transporting food, blankets and medicines raised by the UVBC to the Mekong Delta for distribution to flood victims.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The group was allegedly intercepted by Vietnamese security police before they left Ho Chi Minh City, and were forced to disperse. Several of the group's leaders were reportedly arrested and three are said to remain in detention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These allegations elicited on 9 November a communique from the Fatherland Front, the official umbrella group for non-governmental organisations, including religious ones, in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(The UVBC is not affiliated to the Fatherland Front as it is a banned organisation. The Vietnam Buddhist Church, set up in 1981, is the legal body representing Vietnam's buddhists.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 9 November communique in effect denied that any arrests or harassment occurred, although it also made the point that any aid to flood victims, which it was encouraging, had to be channelled through the Fatherland Front.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Embassy in Hanoi has spoken to other diplomatic missions and interested journalists, none of whom can shed much light on the allegations. Vietnamese officials concede that a "situation" had arisen in the south in which they claim that the UVBC was trying to organise a "propaganda campaign" using flood relief activities as a cover. Officials maintain, however, that no arrests were made, and that monks and religious were "asked" to return to their home pagodas and to abandon their campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our Embassy will continue to seek further details.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I indicated yesterday, religious persecution remains a serious concern which the Government regularly takes up with the Vietnamese authorities, and we will continue to do so.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will certainly do so again if any truth is established in the latest reports raised by Senator Reid&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">particularly as they relate to alleged interference in the delivery of humanitarian relief to flood victims for which the Vietnamese Government had already sought international assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to general business notice of motion No. 1264 standing in the name of Senator Short for this day, ordering the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to attend and give evidence before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.</PARA>
<PARA>There are many reasons why Senator Bolkus should be required to appear before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration for its inquiry into the Immigration Review Tribunal appointments. The Senate will be failing in its responsibility if it does not adopt this motion to require the minister to appear before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration to give evidence in relation to the committee's inquiry into the Immigration Review Tribunal's appointment processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me outline briefly why the Senate would be abrogating its responsibility if it fails to call the minister before its committee. The first point is that the reference before the committee is a reference from the Senate. It was adopted by resolution of this Senate. It is not just another reference thought up by the committee itself. The Senate therefore has an obligation to itself, indeed to the parliament as a whole, and a responsibility to ensure that the migration committee, which comprises members of the major parties from both the House of Representatives and the Senate, is given every opportunity to complete the task that the Senate itself set it just a few short weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is ultimately responsible for appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal and the processes that precede those appointments. The migration committee cannot be said to have fully completed its inquiry unless it has heard from the one person who must be regarded as the principal witness&mdash;namely, the minister. He minister has so far refused to appear before the committee. He has, therefore, deliberately and wilfully flouted the decision of the Senate to have the committee conduct the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, the minister has joined a long string of ministers from this arrogant government who have stamped on the rights and the responsibilities of the elected parliament of this nation; who have said, in effect, that it is the executive that is paramount in this nation, not the elected parliament. Remember the Prime Minister asserting that question time is a privilege bestowed on the parliament by the executive, not a basic democratic right of the elected representatives of the people?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus's refusal to appear before the migration committee is merely another illustration of this dangerous anti-democratic arrogance of the government. Are we in this place going to let him get away with that? The standing orders of the Senate quite clearly contemplate the Senate requiring the minister to appear before an inquiry established by the Senate&mdash;which is, of course, what my motion attempts to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there exists and has existed opportunity for some questioning of the minister on the matters which are the subject of the standing committee's inquiry, there is certainly not full opportunity. In any event, that point is, to an important extent, a red herring because the joint standing committee will not have in the official transcript or records of its inquiry anything from the minister unless he appears before the committee. It is also relevant that the committee includes members of the House of Representatives as well as senators, so deliberations in the Senate alone, including during question time or during consideration of estimates by a legislation committee, have no direct relevance to the other house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although some senators, including me, have been able to ask questions of the minister in the appropriate Senate legislation committee, that committee is not a suitable venue for a full examination with the minister of all the matters that are the subject of the joint standing committee's inquiry. There are many matters that require further consideration, which I am sure the Senate is aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another extremely important reason why the minister should appear before the committee, and that is that this parliament passed the Migration Reform Act, which gives to two tribunals within the minister's portfolio, including the Immigration Review Tribunal, greatly enhanced powers over the lives of applicants for immigration to Australia by virtue of the fact that it severely restricts appeals from those tribunals to the courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential, therefore, that the clients of the tribunals and the general community have confidence in the professionalism and objectivity of these tribunals. They can have this only if they have confidence in the processes of appointment to the tribunals. That requires transparency and accountability by the minister in the processes that he follows in selecting candidates and in the appointments he eventually makes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It became increasingly obvious during the hearings of the migration committee that many elements of this vitally important aspect of the terms of reference of this inquiry require further examination, which cannot be done without the appearance of the minister. For that reason, I urge the Senate to adopt this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night's examination came after 14 or 15 hours of deliberation by the joint standing committee. It came on top of questions asked in the Senate. No new evidence had been found against me at all. Not one word was transcribed in the newspapers this morning despite those two and a bit hours of discussion last night on appointments to the tribunals, particularly the IRT. We spent two and a bit hours on the IRT, and there was not one word in the papers and not one bit of new evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite disingenuous again to come in here and say that I am rejecting the power of the Senate. The Senate and its processes have exhaustively examined me. But what we are seeing here is a direct flouting and misrepresentation of the process. One would have thought that, if it were necessary for me to come before a committee, that would have been planned earlier in the committee's proceedings. But on Monday of this week, on the last day and at the last hour before the committee was going to contemplate its final report to this place&mdash;and despite the fact that Senator Short asked a question about this a week ago and the committee deliberated on it 12 days ago&mdash;Senator Short came in here and gave notice that he was going to move this motion, knowing full well after discussions last week that time this week is limited for all of us. That is why we met exhaustively until 1.30 this morning. Senator Short is the one who is dissembling the facts on this particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short also forgot to mention that the committee was set up, has deliberated and has decided it does not want me. That is an important factor in all this as well. I have been exhaustively examined. I have subjected myself to the committee; I have not snubbed the Senate and its processes. In two and a bit hours of discussion on the IRT there was not one word in the press, but on the last day Senator Short came in here and tried in the way he normally does to score political points. No degree of loud wailing and no degree of allegations about lying, interference and whatever will overcome those basic facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other basic fact is that this has been a stunt from the start.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion ought to be passed without debate. This motion is about accountability and it is about the refusal of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to appear before the Joint Standing Committee on Migration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus has said in his defence that he appeared before the estimates committee. If appearance before an estimates committee in relation to the expenditure of a department is to abrogate responsibility from a joint parliamentary committee, there is something seriously wrong with our processes, because you know, Mr Deputy President, how limited the right to question is during estimates and how much many ministers, especially Senator Bolkus, utilise every opportunity to try to limit the right to question during estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus has a reputation in this place&mdash;in fact, I am sure Senator Bolkus prides himself on his reputation in this place&mdash;for trying to be obstructive during estimates. An appearance before an estimates committee is no substitute for an appearance before a duly constituted committee of this parliament which has had a reference to conduct an inquiry into a particular matter. Senator Bolkus knows it. It is a sad reflection on this minister's capacity to understand the role of a joint parliamentary committee that he would presume to think it is sufficient merely to turn up at an estimates hearing and obfuscate his way through that at the best of times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no defence that Senator Bolkus comes before the Senate and waves a videotape with goodness knows what on it and says, `I appeared before the estimates committee. I don't have to answer any more of these questions.' If appearance before an estimates committee is all that is required, the opportunity to examine ministers in this place will be limited to twice a year. It will be limited to when the estimates next come around. We will be constantly hassled by the minister and the government members on the committee to hurry up and get on to the next subject. That is not parliamentary scrutiny, and honourable senators all well know that that is not parliamentary scrutiny. Unfortunately, that is far from parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus's next defence was a defence on the merits, supposedly, of his case. He said, `But these are all people of good standing.' If these are all people of good standing, what is the point of Senator Bolkus's reluctance to appear before the committee? If these are all people of good standing, what is the problem with the inquiry going ahead? Surely the assertion that an appointee is a person of good standing is not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have said many times that it is appropriate we look at the manner in which an administration conducts itself and at the people who are appointed to positions. The Democrats have supported us on a number of occasions&mdash;the former Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Frank Kelly, is a case in point&mdash;in relation to these matters where it was considered appropriate to look at the qualifications of the persons who were appointed to particular positions of office. Therefore, it is no defence for Senator Bolkus merely to assert that these are people of good standing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry has gotten to the point where the committee wants to hear from the minister the grounds on which certain people were appointed. If that is not allowed, all we get is a minister evading his responsibility&mdash;evading</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I say that this motion should be supported. Senator Short's motion No. 1264 should, in fact, be passed by this Senate so that the minister can be compelled to meet his responsibilities; so that people outside this place have an assurance that good administration is being safeguarded by this parliament; and so that we can be assured that this Labor government, which has such a reputation for cheating, dishonesty and corruption, does not continue it further. That is why this motion is so important. That is why the suspension of standing orders should be supported. That is why Senator Short's motion No. 1264 should be supported for the good administration of this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats supported the reference that is now the subject of this debate because we thought that the minister had a case to answer and that it should be investigated by the committee. The committee has heard evidence. The committee has made an informal request to the minister, which the minister has refused. A formal motion to request the minister to appear before the committee has been rejected, but we must be cognisant of the fact that that motion was passed along party lines. On the basis of formal procedures, the minister was not requested to appear before the committee. The Australian Democrats have been in these sorts of situations before: ministers have been asked to be accountable to Senate committees, a responsibility which they have tried to avoid. Indeed, we feel extremely strongly about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of other factors in this case, however, that need to be taken into account. There was a meeting before the legislation committee dealing with estimates last night and, in Senator Short's own words, Senator Short grilled the minister for an hour and a half on the questions that he would put to him through the committee or before the committee. On this substantive issue the Democrats have decided not to support Senator Short's motion. We believe that it would amount to duplication of effort and be a waste of time. I must admit that it smacks somewhat of a witch hunt when this opportunity in substance was available to the opposition at the time, to now take the view it wants to re-run the questions and the whole debate again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short was kind enough to provide me with written information detailing his reasons why the minister should go before the committee. This included some questions that were to be put to the minister in a fairly general way. I understand that the questions contained in the advice from Senator Short have already been put to the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that in the present circumstances the proper procedure would be for last night's questions and answers to be submitted to the committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still time for that course to be taken. If the minister is saying&mdash;and it is an argument which conditionally, on balance and somewhat uneasily we accept&mdash;that we do not wish to duplicate effort, then let us ensure that the results of that effort are incorporated in the committee's report. If that is not to happen, I feel there is a case for the matter to proceed further. But as matters stand today, and in view of the fact that neither I nor anybody else has been able to examine the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of last night's proceedings, and as it appears efforts would be duplicated, the Democrats are not disposed to support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it will create a problem because last evening, prior to the legislation committee undertaking its estimates review, the Joint Standing Committee on Migration finalised its report on the terms of reference which had been referred to the committee on motion by Senator Short on 20 October this year. Certainly 20 October was some weeks ago, and the other date one should bear in mind, 15 August, is now of course some months ago and that was when these issues&mdash;the subject matter of the terms of reference&mdash;were first raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember those dates because some concerns were expressed by questions on notice by Senator Short about the appointment processes way back in August. On 20 October, following some debate in this place, Senator Short moved reference to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration. The committee undertook its task of holding a public inquiry on the terms of reference. The committee held three public hearings&mdash;extended public hearings where, among other people, the principal member of the Immigration Review Tribunal, Ms Pam O'Neil, was before the committee for some five hours of detailed questioning. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs was before the committee for six hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back to August, I understand a request for the minister to appear before the committee was not made until the dying hours of the very last day of the public hearings. That request was in addition to the days set aside for the witnesses that the committee had agreed to call before it. I ask the Senate to take that matter into consideration when voting or deciding on this motion. Quite apart from that, the committee has had other matters to consider involving scrutiny of what relates to the terms of reference. I am trying to be careful because the matters on which the committee determined last night are not public and will not become public until Thursday of this week when the report is presented to parliament. I do not want to divulge the contents of that report or enter into debate upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wheels have now turned and the cart has moved along at a considerable pace. In fact, the cart has passed by but Senator Short has not recognised that fact. This last gasp effort to reopen the committee process should be doomed to failure. I do not know how the committee, in this last week of Senate sittings for 1994, could undertake the task, were the task to be given to it, and present its report prior to the conclusion of the sittings. Furthermore, I am not sure about the standing of the motion if it were to be carried and how it would apply to the committee. It is a joint committee made up of members of the other place as well as senators from this chamber. The committee has taken the decision not to invite the minister to appear before it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to indicate where the Greens stand in relation to this motion. We do not support it at this juncture. However, we believe that some very important principles, which we agree with, underlie the moving of that motion. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) should be accountable for the ways in which these appointments are made. There should be a process by which his testimony can be brought before a joint committee or a Senate committee or evaluated in terms of the basis or the process by which appointments are made. If for no other reason than allegations are made that there are political motivations underlying the appointment, there should be some clear means of asserting that that is untrue. We do not have that clarity unless we have a better accountability procedure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, it is quite amiss that the Joint Committee on Migration did not seek and gain before it the minister's witness. That was clearly the appropriate way to go. To now ask the Senate to force that to happen causes me two problems. Firstly, I have been part of a joint committee which has received a request of the Senate, and I have not been impressed by the kind of regard in which those recommendations or requests are held. Secondly, I do not feel that the committee that it is being referred to at the moment has shown itself to be doing its job if it has not already interviewed the minister with regard to this matter. That is why I do not particularly support the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questioning that occurred in estimates last night attempted to look at the content of the concerns. It is well and good if the committee is able to reopen its considerations prior to submitting a report on the matter and look at the testimony of the minister that was given last night. However, I do not feel that addresses the procedural point, which is that a minister need not be requested by the Senate to appear. If a minister is requested to appear, he or she should do so. I feel that it may be the wrong committee and not the right time at which to push it in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicate my support in general for the principle that ministers should be able to appear before committees and give an account of how they came to their determinations, especially with regard to a statutory body. I would have felt much more sympathetic towards a Senate committee that looked at these issues. That might have been a better way to go. In this instance, we will not support the motion. But I am pleased to record that in some way the minister will give testimony to the committee, even though it will be by a very windy path. </PARA>

<PARA>The question of defence housing is something which has been of importance to me since the day I came into this parliament. In fact, a large slab of my maiden speech, which I was re-reading the other day, was directed at the failure of this government and preceding governments to provide decent housing for Defence Force personnel. In that speech I pointed to the totally unsatisfactory situation of navy families living in Sydney who did not have a hot water service. In 1986 I thought that was a pretty incredible thing to have to tell the parliament of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition put a lot of pressure on the government. There was an inquiry into personnel conditions of service, and I must acknowledge the fact that the government did decide to move. The government has been facilitated by the total support of the opposition in respect of the introduction of the Defence Housing Authority. As a result of the measures that have been put in place as a result of that move, we can at last say that Australia's servicemen and women now have a chance of living in decent accommodation. And so they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see the recognition given by the Auditor-General that approximately 10,000 substandard houses have been replaced since the authority commenced operations in 1988. The authority also owns or leases from the private market housing that is provided to members. Defence pays a market rent to the authority for those houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is not always realised is that Defence Force members do pay rent for their housing. I found a fairly common assumption among some civilians that Defence Force personnel get free housing. They get nothing of the sort. However, there is a rent subsidy. That subsidy is partly designed to deal with the question of the substandard nature of the accommodation. It is also intended to recognise that Defence Force personnel are moved to a place that suits their employer; it is not necessarily a place that they would move to of their own accord or a place that is of their own choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the imposition of the fringe benefits tax on this housing is ludicrous. I criticised it when it was introduced; I still criticise it today. What disturbs me is that we have people in the Department of Finance sending a bill to the Department of Defence for fringe benefits tax; then we have people in the Department of Defence doing the calculations and sending the money off to the Department of Finance; then we have the Department of Finance actually supplementing the Department of Defence's budget by the amount of the fringe benefits tax. This arrangement could only be devised by a public organisation! A private organisation surely could not be so stupid as to administer its affairs in that manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said all that, the fringe benefits tax gets included in the calculations of the cost of defence housing. To give the Auditor-General his due, having included it in, he then deducted it out again in order to make his points. I make the point that this tax is a nonsense and it should be got rid of. If the minister, Senator Ray, were anything like a man he would stand up to the finance minister and get rid of fringe benefits tax impositions on the entitlements of Defence Force personnel. They are conditions of service: they reflect the requirements that go with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disturbed by two or three things that are in the Auditor-General's report. I will be as brief as I can in canvassing those issues on which I would like to make a comment. In one of the items the Auditor-General refers to reviews of ADF accommodation and the possibility of a cash payment to members in lieu of subsidised housing. He points out that the cash subsidy option has a number of advantages in terms of simplicity and freedom of choice but that it could have significant implications to the Defence Housing Authority, and tax considerations would be an important element. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I worry about the cash subsidy option. Although it is superficially attractive, I am concerned that cash subsidies tend to stay fixed and they tend to be devalued over the passage of time. Uncaring governments could allow that subsidy to be whittled away to little or nothing. The current arrangement has a certainty about it and we have all become used to it. I would want to be convinced of the value of any change before I could endorse it. That question is yet to be decided. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is a need for Defence to seek Government endorsement of the nature and level of ADF housing assistance as soon as recent reviews, including the study of a cash subsidy option, are finalised.</PARA>
<PARA>I would ask the government to be as open as it possibly can about these reviews and about its position on them. This is a matter which is always of great concern to Defence Force families. It is something which vitally affects their standard of living. The easiest way for them to be fearful is for a rumour to sweep around as to what the government's position will be as a result of these reviews of the housing assistance arrangements. I alert the minister to the real concern that there is in Defence Force families about that issue. There is a need to address that concern sensitively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about scales and standards, too. Over the years, this has been a very vexed issue and defence force personnel have paid a heavy price. A great number of houses which are now considered to be substandard were provided in the 1950s. They were prefabricated cottages which were pretty consistent with the standard of housing in Australia after the end of the war when there were housing and material shortages and, as a result, fibro houses and little wooden cottages were the norm around Australian suburbs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, therefore, housing of this prefabricated nature which was provided for defence force families was pretty consistent with community standards. As the years passed and we got into the 1980s&mdash;and now into the 1990s in a few cases&mdash;defence force families were still living in these houses which had become completely out of kilter with community norms. I am concerned at the flagging of the comparison with community standards. The Auditor-General said in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO raised the need for Defence to ensure that ADF housing standards were consistent with current community standards for civilians in similar income groups.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to talk about the need:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to ensure that dwellings do not exceed defence requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem here is that similar income groups in the community are not necessarily reflective of similar skill levels. For example, we have very highly skilled people. One of them may hold the rank of corporal, have several children and be entitled to welfare supplements. So the income of defence force personnel does not truly reflect their importance to the organisation they serve. They are professionals. If we are too determined to tie the community standards and similar income groups to the sort of housing that we give to other ranks, we may house them poorly in comparison with their abilities and importance to us as a nation. We should be very careful that, in making sure that dwellings do not exceed Defence requirements, we properly recognise the need to maintain good standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to be careful. We do not want to go back to the bad old days when anything was good enough for the defence forces. We have moved from that position since 1988. The Auditor-General pointed out that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major cause of the shortage of Group A houses appears to be that the DHA, with Defence concurrence, has provided houses of a standard in excess of Defence requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is in the eye of the beholder. I am very glad that Defence was prepared to put its service personnel into houses which were above the strictly written standards for the various ranks. I hope that Defence and the government continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Group A housing is fairly inexpensive housing and of a fairly poor level by Australian standards today. The Defence Housing Authority maintains that it is uneconomic to provide group A housing for Defence because, for example, it has a very poor resale value. It is not the sort of housing that most Australians want to buy. That is an important matter for consideration by the Defence Housing Authority in the resalability that is needed. Because, as Defence needs change, it needs to be able to turn over defence houses and sell them on the open market. So the houses should have some relevance to the standards which Australians expect when going out to buy a house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the high wastage rates in 1986 and Manfred Cross's report on personnel wastage in the ADF. In the government's response to that report, there was a clear indication that the most important thing in the provision of housing assistance to ADF members would be the maintenance of the greatest extent of choice possible. I am sad to see that the Auditor-General said that this does not appear to have been fully implemented. The Auditor-General recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">members should be allowed a greater degree of choice in the type, cost and location of housing they occupy, consistent with satisfying Defence operational requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very glad to see that spelled out, but I am slightly disturbed at the suggestion that the government's position does not appear to have been fully implemented. I urge the minister to look at that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to Defence of vacant houses and of the allocation of inappropriate housing according to the Auditor-General was $35.5 million in 1993-94. He said that urgent action to reduce these costs is essential. I agree wholeheartedly. Defence dollars are too hard to come by, and there are too many calls on those dollars for any of them to be wasted. If we can reduce the figure from $35.5 million, we should certainly do so. I am glad to see that the Auditor-General has recognised that systems that have been introduced in 1993 should improve the management and control of the housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter which I take issue with is the question of the 52 representational houses. These are usually houses which have an important heritage value to our nation. They have been occupied for decades&mdash;if not a century&mdash;by the defence forces of this nation. They are treasures which we really all own. The Commonwealth has constitutional responsibility for the maintenance of our national heritage. It so happens that  Defence meets the cost of maintaining these houses. They are special houses. Perhaps the cost should be borne by the Heritage Commission and not by Defence. The Auditor-General recommended that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Defence examine the need for the continued occupancy of each of these expensive properties.</PARA>
<PARA>They have to be maintained by somebody. The Commonwealth has owned them for a very long time. The Commonwealth has maintained them very well. Nobody in this country can exceed the Department of Defence in the heritage and environmental standards it is maintaining in places like HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>. We have a very good trustee for the maintenance and management of these heritage houses in the defence department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not inappropriate that recognition should be given to those who are high achievers in the defence forces of this country. In terms of income, they do not equate to the high achievers in business, but they are critically important to the wellbeing of this nation. Surely their long years of distinguished service can be appropriately recognised by letting them use these houses which belong to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the nation has to maintain them anyway. Defence personnel certainly pay rent, although not obviously such as would be sufficient to finance the maintenance of these houses. These are expensive properties to maintain in the sense that historic properties always are. But if the defence department did not do the work, who would? So long as we can find an appropriate mechanism, these houses should be retained for the purposes for which they have long been used. </PARA>
<PARA>The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In May 1989 the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel made a Ministerial Statement requiring the DHA to take over leases arranged under Temporary Rental Allowance (TRA) conditions. Members eligible to rent privately would advise the Authority of the details of suitable accommodation that had been found and the DHA would take out the lease. Bonds paid by individuals would be eliminated and the DHA would manage repairs and maintenance in consultation with the landlord.</PARA>
<PARA>As the Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The important element of choice was to be preserved.</PARA>
<PARA>I find it extraordinary that, although the department and DHA officers initiated some action regarding this matter in 1989, the approach outlined by the minister has not been implemented. I have to ask the minister&mdash;and I am very glad that he is here while I am speaking&mdash;to have a look at this and be ready to tell us why the 1989 statement by the then Minister for Defence Science and Personnel has not been implemented. There is no explanation given here as to why this is so. I would expect the current Minister for Defence to start asking some questions in his department and be prepared to advise the parliament of the answers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did chuckle&mdash;perhaps chuckle is not too strong to say&mdash;at reading the fact that the TRA data has not been readily available to the Auditor-General. I have been through estimates committees over a number of years where data which one would have expected to be basic was not available to the estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have hoped that by now the Auditor-General would be able to get access to this sort of information, although, to give Defence its due, it actually seems to be getting better at being able to provide some of these details. Perhaps this is just one area the minister has not yet swept out. I urge him to see what can be done about that information that the Auditor-General needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General also indicated that in 1994 there were delays in the identification of vacated properties which resulted in Defence incurring unnecessary rental charges of about $700,000. That is extraordinary. If it were not for the fact that the Auditor-General has gone on to say that measures are now in place which should prevent that happening in the future, I would be very much more upset about it than I am. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed and I find it extraordinary that, with the numbers of people we have had looking at good management in defence matters across all the programs in the last couple of years or so, it took an Auditor-General's analysis to point out the fact that there was need for action in this area. That waste of $700,000 is a great shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocations of service housing is another matter to which the Auditor-General referred. I am glad to see that there has been a system introduced which will provide improved management and control of the housing stock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the standards which had been allowed to drop from the 1950s to the 1980s must not be allowed to happen again. The Defence Force personnel are too important to the future of this country and to the wellbeing of the nation to be disheartened by the poor morale that comes from poor housing and from families being shifted from pillar to post in substandard accommodation. The improvement in housing over the last few years&mdash;since 1988 and the introduction of the Defence Housing Authority&mdash;is to be welcomed and to be praised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not want to think that attention to every single dollar&mdash;although each one of them is important&mdash;means that flexibility, choice and high standards would be ignored. We have to proceed prudently as far as the dollar is concerned, but we must recognise that, to maintain people in whom we have invested so heavily for their training, we must give them good housing, we must manage it well and we must be fair to them and give them some choice and flexibility. I am glad that the Auditor-General has made this report. I have a couple of things on which to take issue, but on the whole it is a program which appears to be standing up pretty well. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 24 March this year, when the Senate agreed to an inquiry into rural adjustment, rural debt and rural reconstruction, I must admit that I thought it might be difficult for the Rural and Regional Affairs Committee to produce a unanimous report, given the complex and emotive nature of the relevant issues. In its inimitable manner, though, the committee went out and  talked to the people in rural Australia about adjustment processes and the heavy burden of debt and its social, economic and ecological impact on farmers, their communities and the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee held 17 public hearings in places ranging from the Murchison in Western Australia, to Charleville in Queensland, to West Wyalong and Gilgandra in New South Wales. We heard evidence from 262 witnesses, several of whom took advantage of the committee's practice of allowing people to come from the audience to have their two-bob's worth. I consider that the unanimous report I have just tabled demonstrates that committee members have listened to rural Australia, have wrestled with major issues and, I am confident, have come up with proposals that will encourage a robust, competitive and sustainable rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the committee has reached 33 major conclusions and makes 27 specific recommendations. In this chairman's tabling statement it would be impossible for me to address all of these matters. Also, I am mindful that other members of the committee will want to speak to the report at the earliest opportunity. However, I wish to speak briefly on seven major themes running through the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the focus of the current rural adjustment scheme, known as RAS 92, is towards longer term adjustment measures and, in particular, farm productivity, profitability and sustainability. The committee formed the view that this message has not been relayed to rural Australia and that generally people do not appreciate the fundamental and significant change in focus from assistance measures provided under RAS 88 to adjustment measures based on viability and long-term profitability in RAS 92. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to this situation the committee makes several recommendations relating to the administration and management of the scheme at the Commonwealth and state level. Primarily, the committee is of the view that there needs to be more a consistent and uniform approach to adjustment measures and that guidelines issued by the Commonwealth need to be more prescriptive. This is not meant to hinder flexibility but rather to avoid ambiguities and anomalies in interpretations and results. In turn, this will mean that potential recipients will have a clearer understanding of their eligibility for the entitlements to adjustment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also addressed issues such as access to information, the promotion and delivery of programs and the level of funding. The committee welcomes recent initiatives to make the funding of assistance to exceptional circumstances drought areas demand driven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the scheme as a whole, members of the committee are concerned that there are few mechanisms in place to monitor the effectiveness and performance of adjustment measures. Accordingly, we recommend that the establishment of a fully operational management information system must be given urgent attention and that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy should monitor more closely the success or otherwise of programs at grassroots level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the committee considers that, in the short to medium term, several aspects of rural adjustment must be improved and changed. Confusion about the current scheme is so widespread that the government should introduce a revamped  scheme based on recommendations made in this report and give that scheme a new name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the committee indicates that the focus of this revamped rural adjustment scheme should continue to be on farm productivity, profitability and sustainability, but with a principal component being skills enhancement, access to professional advice and the development of financial management, as well as the re-establishment grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter I wish to address relates to exceptional circumstances. The committee reached the unanimous conclusion that exceptional circumstances should be removed from rural adjustment and made the subject of a separate Commonwealth-state agreement. On this matter we heard persuasive evidence that exceptional circumstances and RAS are mutually exclusive and inconsistent and that exceptional circumstances provisions distort the primary adjustment focus on productivity. The existence of exceptional circumstances within RAS clouds the real purpose of the rural adjustment scheme, as it promotes an assistance flavour&mdash;the very element that RAS is seeking to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also recommends that the Commonwealth government define what it means by `exceptional circumstances' but, more particularly, establish a definition of drought that will allow a consistent and clearly enunciated government response when farmers cannot reasonably cope with prolonged dry conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee looked at each component of RAS 92 and, where necessary, has made recommendations to improve adjustment measures. For example, we received evidence questioning the effectiveness of interest rate subsidies as an instrument to facilitate rural adjustment. We recommend that the government needs to examine this matter more closely. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the committee received considerable evidence on re-establishment grants, which are intended to provide an incentive for farmers without prospects to exit with dignity. The members of the committee are not convinced that these objectives are being achieved and recommend that the Commonwealth consider increasing the level of the grant or, alternatively, modifying the current assets threshold so that farming families may exit with more assets. We also recommend that the link between eligibility for the re-establishment grant and jobsearch allowance be abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth matter that I would like to address is a theme that rightly pervades this report, that of skills enhancement and education. The committee is convinced that sound financial and management skills are the key to the reconstruction of rural Australia. Accordingly, the committee recommends that these programs should become a principal component of rural adjustment. This already important issue gains further importance when it is realised that in Australia today the average age of farmers is 58 years. The report recommends that the government should examine whether it is appropriate for rural adjustment programs, particularly the skills enhancement component, to include measures that will encourage young farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second part of the report, the committee notes that rural debt is estimated to be $17 billion. This debt is a symptom rather than the cause of more fundamental and deep-seated problems in rural Australia. We consider that improved farm and business management skills are the key to tackling these problems and will result in a strong competitive and sustainable farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to re-establishment grants, the committee reached the conclusion that skills and training should also be an important part of this adjustment process and therefore recommends that the Commonwealth government should include a specific retraining program in these grants to enable farmers to meet the challenge of leaving the farm with confidence and future prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final major theme that I wish to address relates to the long term. The committee is of the view that the need for rural adjustment measures and exceptional circumstances provisions should diminish when the Commonwealth government provides an environment that will encourage farmers to adopt a self-reliant, risk management approach to farming. The loudest and clearest message that the committee got from the bush is that farmers do not want handouts, they want to be self-reliant. This environment will be achieved when an attractive income equalisation deposit scheme is introduced and tax measures that adversely affect farmers and rural areas are changed. I sincerely hope that the committee's recommendations on IEDs, tax averaging, provisional tax and tax credits are part and parcel of the package that will be considered by cabinet tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated earlier, the report addresses many issues, only some of which I have dealt with today. Others include: a grassroots regional approach to adjustment; appeal mechanisms; and farm inspections. In the final section of the report, the committee also draws conclusions on the important role that the banks and lending institutions must play in rural Australia and we recommend that the Commonwealth government should examine proposals for a farm debt mediation service. I am sure that these matters will be addressed in more detail by other members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, it would be remiss of me not to acknowledge the considerable contribution to this inquiry made by Senator Burns, who chaired the committee until changes to the Senate committee structure were introduced in October of this year. I thank him and the other members of the committee, past and present, for their work on this very important inquiry. I also thank the secretariat&mdash;Neil Bessell, Peter Hallahan, John O'Keefe, Jacquie Hawkins and Chris Migus&mdash;for the work they have done on this report, and the other workload they have achieved in the last few months. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>It gives me pleasure to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Southern Africa, which took place in July 1994. As the leader of the delegation, Mr Ben Humphreys, said on a number of occasions, it was a delegation of the parliament, meaning that there were representatives of government, being Mr Humphreys and Mr Colin Hollis; two representatives from the opposition, being the deputy leader of the delegation Ms Trish Worth and Mr Richard Evans; a delegate from the Australian Democrats, Senator Coulter; and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a good opportunity for us to see an area of the world which does not receive a lot of attention in this parliament. In recent times we have tended to focus quite narrowly, to my way of thinking, on the Asian region as the area of major interaction between the Australian government and the world. But it seems there are many people who would like to interact more with Australia and southern Africa seems an amazingly obvious place for that to happen. There are similarities in climate and in the problems we face&mdash;some problems are different&mdash;but we could learn a lot more from each other than we currently do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went to four countries during the delegation's visit: Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and South Africa. The reason for that order was so we could talk to people in other countries in southern Africa before talking to those people with the exciting prospect of living in South Africa in a post-election era. We wanted to talk to people who had gone through the process of independence with majority governments to see what lessons they had learned or felt could be learned by South Africa before talking to people in South Africa about what was happening there. That was very exciting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess we all went with different expectations and different areas of interest. In Zimbabwe, I was particularly concerned about the impact of the structural adjustment that came from the level of debt dependence through the IMF and the World Bank. In many countries, especially those in southern Africa, that dependence has meant a push towards exports, a push towards attracting investment and a push for the government to follow a model structural adjustment. In every country it has meant a cut in government spending, a reduction of jobs in the public sector and less money available for social infrastructure and social security. It has also meant a push for production for export. The problem for a delegation with so many interests was that, while we wanted to speak to as many people and find out as much as we possibly could, the ability to go into the rural areas and find out what the issues were at that level was almost non-existent. That was unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were able to talk to people on the ground level about the impact of AIDS in a number of countries. In some countries in southern Africa the official recognition is that there might be one in seven sexually active people who are affected by AIDS. In many cases the only way that they can gain information about those kinds of statistics is when women present for childbirth and they are able to take blood samples then and they are also able to test children who present with symptoms which seem to be indicative of AIDS or HIV positive illnesses. It is a real problem which, to a large extent, is underestimated. It is very difficult address it in a situation where many people, for historical or cultural reasons, find it difficult to talk about the issues of safe sex and multi-partnering and there is a problem about providing and distributing information about safe sex. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter and I were also interested in a number of other issues. We were particularly interested in the impact of decisions about the economy on ecological sustainability and also in finding out what impact the new international trade regimes would have on developing countries. We asked a number of people, both formally and informally, what impact the Uruguay Round of GATT might have. I must say that the majority of people to whom I spoke said that they were not very cognisant of the implications of the Uruguay Round of GATT before it was signed. They felt there was a push for them to be involved and they have in fact been learning more about it since the signing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the majority of people that I spoke to answered that the more they heard about it and the more they found out about it, the more they were concerned about the impact on less developed countries, especially places such as Zimbabwe. There were exceptions to this but I believe there is a growing concern that the benefits that are meant to be coming, especially to developing countries, may not happen in that way. People also feel that in intellectual property there may be some very big setbacks in the ability of those owners of ideas and information to be able to manipulate the situation in ways that have adverse consequences on those countries with the least power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the trip to Namibia, I was particularly interested to find out how an economy works in the middle of a desert. It was an amazing situation. The thing that struck me most about Namibia was that it was not just a dual economy; in fact it was at least a three-way economy. There was a city which was very much like many European cities. Prices for many of the goods in that city were very much akin to European prices. On the edge of the city were satellite areas for African Namibians. The standard of housing was not of European standard but it was reasonable and some new houses were being developed. But then there were whole areas of Namibia where there were still people starving during droughts and there were some serious problems. There is a very big and growing difference between the rich and the poor in Namibia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also were privileged to go to Walvis Bay which was controlled by South Africa for many years and has only recently&mdash;earlier this year&mdash;been transferred back to Namibia. That is very exciting because it means that the fishing industry of Namibia can now be controlled from the coast of Namibia. There are some problems with over-fishing. I think that in the years of build-up, when perhaps South Africa felt that there was going to be a handover of that particular area, the conservation strategies for the fishing industry were virtually non-existent. So we have a situation where the Namibian government is now looking at how it can build up its fish stocks and try to ensure that it has a sustainable industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Botswana, I think for most of us, was an area that we knew little about. I must say that there has never been an Australian parliamentary delegation to Namibia since independence, nor has there been one to Botswana. There have been very few to Zimbabwe, and of course this was the first to South Africa since the change of government. So it was a very important delegation for information. Botswana has become, in many ways, quite Europeanised. To me it is quite sad to see that the culture of many African countries has almost been swallowed up and they are just now beginning to look at how to value their own culture. There is also a huge AIDS problem in Botswana. There are actually posters along the road in Botswana admitting that one in seven of the sexually active population has AIDS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But South Africa was, I guess, what we were largely working towards in speaking to people from various countries. There are still huge structural problems and huge needs to be addressed. We went to Alexandria, a township which was designed for 60,000 people and has in excess of 200,000. While we were there several houses caught alight in a rather serious fire. Because of the amount of plastic that people had used in trying to build this housing, it was obviously a very toxic fire as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The land issues in South Africa are huge. At the moment the South Africans are dealing with rural land issues. They are dealing with the people who have been illegally disenfranchised from land during the period of apartheid and there are still huge problems with equity and land access to be dealt with. A constitutional working group is looking at the problems relating to putting together a constitution for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there may be problems in the future. Currently, South African parliamentarians are being elected on a quota basis and at this stage there are no electorates for these parliamentarians. If that were to continue there may be a problem with parliamentary accountability. I presume that in the future it will move to some sort of mixture between proportional representation and electorates, even if it is a group proportional representation or there is a difference between the two houses. I think that will come with time. But what surprised me was the fact that 80 per cent of the workers in South Africa are still paid differential wages according to their race. That is hard to believe. We assume that many of these changes took place automatically but they did not. In Australia we heard that there were some industrial relations problems. There is still a big struggle to be had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the most extraordinary experience. I would like to thank the high commissioner in Zimbabwe, Kerry Sibraa, his wife Julie and his staff for looking after us so well. I would also like to thank the high commissioner in South Africa, Ross Burns, and his staff for looking after us and giving us the briefings. We were looked after so well in each of the countries that we visited: we were the guests of the governments of Zimbabwe, Namibia and Botswana. It was made simpler by the hard work of the secretary of the delegation, Peter Roberts. I should also like to thank Alan Fewster for his work as adviser from the southern Africa desk in Foreign Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No.2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill contains three sets of amendments to legislation in the industrial relations portfolio. First, the bill alters the arrangements for industrial relations in the coal industry. Secondly, it gives effect to a recommendation of the Remuneration Tribunal that the parliamentary allowance be incorporated into the base salaries of members of parliament. Thirdly, the bill improves the quorum and voting requirements for the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Coal industry</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill represents a landmark step in the rationalisation of industrial relations arrangements in the Australian coal mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides for amendments to the Coal Industry Act 1946 and the Industrial Relations Act 1988. It will bring industrial relations arrangements in the coal industry  into the industrial relations mainstream. From the day it comes into effect, industrial relations in that industry will be regulated by the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coal industry tribunal's powers and functions are presently established by complementary Commonwealth and New South Wales legislation, which commenced in 1946. That makes the coal industry tribunal about the same age as the Liberal Party. Some might say that they are equally anachronistic in the 1990s. Fortunately coal industry unions and employers have proven themselves willing to embrace reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have been able to implement the reform in a manner acceptable to both unions and employers, to whom I want to pay tribute. Without them this historic change could not have been undertaken in an industrially peaceful manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only through detailed negotiations have we have been able to reach agreement with the united mine workers on most aspects of the legislation. Where we have been unable to agree, such as on the issue of access to enterprise flexibility agreements, we have agreed to disagree. In practice the government wouldn't expect this to become a major issue in the industry, given the high level of unionism and the strong leadership of the UMW. Either way, the experience of this legislation gives us cause for optimism that future issues can be addressed in a similarly cooperative, tripartite fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been the way so many of the government's reforms have been achieved in the last decade. And in the coal industry, like so many others, the conservatives left it to Labor to reform the special industrial arrangements that applied, arrangements introduced in 1946 to meet the specific circumstances then applying in New South Wales,  and arrangements that are no longer appropriate to a modern and export-focused industry. Particularly when that industry is now as significant in queensland as it is in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current complementary legislation reflects an agreement between the two governments&mdash;Commonwealth and New South Wales&mdash;for the regulation of the coal industry in New South Wales. Each of the two governments has undertaken not to take any action, without the prior concurrence of the other, to repeal or amend any of the legislation covered by the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government of New South Wales has indicated  to the Commonwealth that it is also their view that industrial regulation of the coal mining industry should be mainstreamed through the transferring of the powers of the coal industry tribunal to the existing Commonwealth and state industrial tribunals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to emphasise that in view of the existing agreement over changes to the current complementary legislation, the measures proposed in this bill will only commence when the Governor of New South Wales agrees in writing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is introduced at a time when the coal industry has been going through a period of significant reform to its administrative and industrial relations arrangements. In 1992 this parliament, acting with the benefit of complementary legislation passed by the New South Wales parliament, made changes to the functions of the Joint Coal Board. This included making the Australian industrial registry responsible for administrative support to the coal industry tribunal, in addition to performing that role for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. Also, during 1992, legislation was passed to establish a new coal mining industry (long service leave funding) corporation to reform the way long service leave was funded and administered in the industry. These reforms are all designed to improve the efficiency of the coal industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role and functions of the coal industry tribunal have of course been the subject of public discussion for many years. A number of previous inquiries have recommended its abolition. However it is only this government, through today's historic legislation, that has bitten the bullet on a necessary reform. It has done so after full consultation and discussion with the relevant industry parties, all of whose views have been taken into account in drafting the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of mainstreaming began in August 1993, when the government wrote to a wide range of industry parties, including the relevant state ministers, seeking their views on the industrial relations arrangements which should apply to the coal industry in the future. We received a range of responses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We continued the consultation process by releasing, in July 1994, a copy of a draft exposure bill and explanatory material outlining a preferred approach to reform. Again, a range of views were received in response. The government has considered all of those views in developing this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We consider that the coal industry should be subject to the same industrial relations institutional arrangements  as other industries. The coal industry no longer needs a separate, specialised and insular industrial relations system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a  fundamental change  in a key  export  industry. We don't deny it will be challenging for the parties to adapt to the mainstream system after such a long period under specialised arrangements, however we are confident they will do so smoothly and effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill, when proclaimed, will mean the abolition of the coal industry tribunal and full integration of coal industry industrial relations arrangements with the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Awards made by the coal industry tribunal will continue in force as if they were awards of the commission, and matters which had commenced in the tribunal will be heard by the commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill expressly provides for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission to have regard to any decisions of the coal industry tribunal that are relevant to the matters before the commission. Furthermore we expect that, in accordance with its usual practice when assuming a new jurisdiction, the commission will give due weight to relevant decisions of the local coal authorities and boards of reference established under the coal industry act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate for the legislation to expressly recognise what would be the practice ordinarily adopted by the commission. The considered views of the previous specialised tribunal ought not be ignored when they are relevant to decisions of the commission. The requirement will be for the commission to `have regard to' relevant decisions, not that it be bound by them. As time passes, earlier decisions of the tribunal will cease to be relevant as they are overtaken by changes in circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following very constructive discussions which the Commonwealth has had with the New South Wales and Queensland governments, the bill will also establish a basis on which New South Wales and Queensland will be able to legislate to overcome jurisdictional restrictions, which would otherwise confront the Australian Industrial Relations Commission in dealing with local disputes in the coal mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If New South Wales or Queensland adopts the federal act, with appropriate modifications, to apply as a law of the state concerned, the commission will be able to exercise the powers and perform the functions available to it under that state law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reflecting the complementary nature of this scheme, any full bench of the commission which is exercising such jurisdiction is, as far as practicable, to include a cross-appointed member of the state tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be further discussions with those states and the industry parties about the best way to implement these aspects of the legislative scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a question of whether New South Wales will be able to change its side of the existing complementary legislation within the same time frame as the Commonwealth. Understandably, the state government wishes to be certain of the final form of the bill after it has been considered by the Australian parliament before proceeding with its own legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid delays, the bill relies on the corporations power for certain transitional purposes. In particular, this relates to the conversion of tribunal awards to commission awards. However, reliance on that constitutional power will cease when complementary New South Wales legislation is in force. I should also mention that the bill's reliance on the trade and commerce power to supplement the commission's jurisdiction will not be necessary since the Commonwealth and state governments are developing a complementary scheme for this industry. In those circumstances, it will be unnecessary to proclaim that provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that the legislation will have effect from a date to be fixed by proclamation. We intend that the bill come into force on 1 July 1995, subject to the agreement of the Governor of New South Wales, as required by the bill. This will allow the commission and the parties enough time to make all appropriate arrangements before the legislation commences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Remuneration of Members of Parliament</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Remuneration and Allowances Act 1990 will implement a recommendation by the remuneration tribunal that the parliamentary allowance of $4,767 per annum, introduced from 1 july 1994, be incorporated into the base salary of senators and members of the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tribunal said that an amendment to the legislation would serve to improve the transparency of parliamentarians' remuneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By way of background to the proposed amendments, the annual base salary of parliamentarians is currently specified in the legislation, and is payable at the maximum salary rate applicable to a senior executive service band 1 officer in the Australian Public Service. This pay linkage provided a practical and sustainable approach to determining salaries of the members of parliament and senators, and ensured that they would not be treated in isolation. However, with the introduction of performance-based pay for the SES, the link originally intended has not been maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliamentary allowance re-established the pay linkage between parliamentarians and the ses at the base of SES band 2. The tribunal, when it determined this allowance, had regard to wage fixing principles of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the spread of enterprise bargaining agreements in the public sector and in the general workforce, as well as developments in parliamentary practice and the conditions under which parliamentary service is performed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that this measure does not affect the net remuneration of members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">National Occupational Health and Safety Commission</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Experience has shown that the quorum and voting requirements in the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission Act are impractical when the commission is considering a grant to an organisation represented in the commission. The bill alters those requirements. It also ensures continuation of the current practice of members of the commission not taking part in deciding grants to the organisations they represent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will involve a very minor increase in Commonwealth expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the integration of the jurisdiction of the coal industry tribunal into that of Australian Industrial Relations Commission, it is necessary to review the financial arrangement between the Commonwealth and New South Wales under which the cost of the administration of the coal industry tribunal is shared. The current annual total administration cost of the coal industry tribunal is $1.216 million.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LIFE INSURANCE BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Life Insurance Bill 1994 introduces a modern regulatory framework for the life insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It represents the first major reform of the life insurance law since the then Treasurer, Ben Chifley introduced the Life Insurance Act 1945. That act will be superseded by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, as in 1945, the life insurance industry makes a significant economic and social contribution to Australia. Thousands of households and businesses rely on savings and risk products sold by life companies. The life industry has assets over $115 billion and plays a key role in our financial system. It also makes an important contribution to raising and managing our national savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the life industry operates in an environment which is considerably different from conditions prevailing in 1945. There have been remarkable technological developments; financial deregulation; advances in actuarial and accounting methods and innovation in life product design.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why we need a completely new regulatory regime. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Prudential Measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Life Insurance Bill 1994 will result in a clearer, stronger and more modern regulatory regime which substantially strengthens prudential controls. It aims to protect policy owners within the framework of a well managed, competitive and financially sound life insurance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures proposed in this bill will make the industry more accountable to consumers, the financial community and the industry regulator, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill ensures that life companies themselves will take a more active and responsible role in supervising their activities and operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors, auditors and actuaries of life companies will have increased responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors will be required to ensure that the life company gives priority to policy owner interests when dealing with statutory fund assets. They will also be required to form an audit committee to monitor financial reporting, internal management and financial controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be given clear supervisory powers over products developed during the past decade as well as new products developed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life companies will be required to meet upgraded solvency and capital adequacy standards demonstrating that they are financially sound, able to meet their existing obligations, and are in a position to continue as a going concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Life Insurance Actuarial Standards Board will be established to develop these and other actuarial standards relevant to life company prudential controls.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More comprehensive and meaningful financial statements will make each life company's solvency position and underlying performance more transparent and capable of comparison.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To more effectively supervise the life insurance industry, the Insurance and Superannuation Commission will be given additional powers and resources to:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that the new regulatory framework will bring some changes to the operations of life companies, and consequently has developed the framework in consultation with the industry. A number of technical requirements have already been made to the bill as a result of ongoing consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consumer measures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government originally signalled that consumer measures would form part of the package for the new life insurance regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial progress has already been made towards the government's goals of improving information disclosure to policy owners and introducing a code of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To establish the best form of disclosure, the ISC has engaged an independent consultant to interview stakeholders, conduct focus groups and run quantitative tests involving 1,200 consumers. The consultant's report is due shortly, and the new disclosure rules should be finalised in early 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work on the code of practice for life companies is also well under way. The government taskforce developing the code is currently considering 70 submissions made on a draft code released last August.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also invited the Life Insurance Federation of Australia to form a working group to develop a framework for an industry based system of accreditation of life agents. The working group will also consider whether any changes to the draft code are desirable when it reports in December.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The draft consumer protection legislation, the disclosure rules and the code will be finalised when these processes are complete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government intends to release draft legislation to facilitate these consumer protection initiatives by the end of this year. This will provide time for public comment prior to introducing the legislation as a separate bill in the Autumn 1995 session of parliament.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In closing, I would like to thank all the people who contributed to developing the new regulatory regime particularly Bob Glading of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Implications</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures contained in the bill to promote policy owners protection and a more efficient life insurance industry will result in additional supervisory costs being incurred by the Insurance and Superannuation Commission.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to effect the repeal of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (Financial Support Fund) Act 1976, that authorised the ratification by Australia of the agreement to establish a financial support fund among OECD members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fund was designed to assist OECD members facing serious external account difficulties following the oil price crisis of 1973-74 and was intended to supplement, on a last resource basis, other sources of credit to which members encountering serious difficulties have had recourse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When proposed to parliament, the government saw the main value of the fund in terms of its capacity to help maintain healthy trading and financial relationships between the major countries, encouraging and assisting members to avoid unilateral trading restrictions. The bill was debated by parliament on 6 May 1976 and the corresponding Act received Royal Assent on 25 August 1976. However, the corresponding legislation was not proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fund was never brought into effect, because of the failure of some other OECD countries (most notably the United States and France) to ratify the agreement. In the meantime, the world economy has already been exposed&mdash;and adjusted&mdash;to two major oil price shocks, the first one, which gave origin to this legislation, when the average crude price for petroleum more than trebled, from $US 3.14 per barrel in 1973 to $US 11.22 per barrel in 1974, and the second one, in the late seventies, when it rose from $US 12.95 per barrel in 1978 to $US 35.48 per barrel in 1980. With petroleum prices now fluctuating in the range of $US 16-17 per barrel (equivalent to around 5 $US per barrel in 1973 prices) we are now a long way back from the sense of emergency of the early seventies.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to refer to the marketing of the disability reform package because it is a textbook case of what not to do with a consultancy. I believe that this report will serve as a benchmark in matters pertaining to the marketing of any package in the future. On 8 February 1994 the Senate referred the marketing of the disability reform package to the committee. The matter came to the attention of the Senate when questions were asked about irregularities in the letting of a $4.95 million consultancy project to market the reforms introduced by the Social Security (Disability and Sickness Support) Act 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to acknowledge the significant contribution made by Senator Patterson, who first raised this matter and pursued it vigorously through several estimates hearings, finally having the matter referred to the then Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs. Senator Patterson has led the way in identifying a number of serious problems in government departments, particularly in the selection and management of consultancies. Her efforts in this inquiry have led to the development of recommendations which should have a substantial effect on the way in which departments should operate in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to note that this inquiry effectively began through the estimates process. While it is clear that much of the evidence obtained by the committee would not have been available in a public hearing, nonetheless the investigation that Senator Patterson initiated demonstrates that estimates committees are an important monitoring and accountability mechanism. When properly used, they can help to identify systemic problems which need to be addressed by widespread reforms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new legislation, which came into effect on 12 November 1991, brought sweeping changes to a broad range of disability pensions, payments and schemes to increase training and rehabilitation. The reforms further emphasised the shift in attitude away from people with disabilities being able to work in sheltered workshops. The legislation clearly encouraged people with disabilities to take up work in positions in the general community where that was possible and proposed measures that would help in this transition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order for the disability reforms to be successful, the attitudes of employers, employees, doctors, health workers, people with disabilities and their parents and carers needed to be changed. They needed to be informed to accept that changes were possible and that support and advice would be available to help in making the transition where that was applicable. The reforms also included changes to support pensions, thereby giving rise to a need to give assurances to parents, carers and people with disabilities that they would still receive their financial assistance under the various programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms cut across the policy and program responsibilities of three different departments: the Department of Social Security, what is now the Department of Human Services and Health and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. These three departments were provided with substantial funding to publicise the changes in disability service, employment opportunities and income support. In 1991 the departments decided to let a $4.95 million consultancy project to market the reforms Australia-wide. I regret to say, on behalf of taxpayers, that it proved to be a gross waste of taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found the disability reform marketing project was fraught with problems from the outset. It seems everything that could go wrong with the consultancy went wrong. It was a great demonstration of Murphy's law. Most importantly, the company contracted to perform the majority of the task, Corporate Impacts Pty Ltd, went into liquidation before the project was finished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's terms of references were to examine and report on, first, the circumstances surrounding the letting of the contracts to market the disability reform package; second, the management of the contracts to market the disability reform package by the management committee and its subcommittees; third, the nature and extent of debts owed to creditors that relate directly or indirectly to contracts to market the disability reform package; fourth, the extent to which the Commonwealth may have been mischarged by companies contracted to market the disability reform package; and fifth, the reasons why advice from two or three departments on the management committee to terminate a contract to market the DRP was not heeded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also to examine and report on the circumstances surrounding the letting of a further contract in April 1993 to a company that was contracted to market the DRP although it must have been suspected that the company was in financial difficulty; the doubts expressed during Senate estimates about the objectivity of the liquidator appointed to a company that was contracted to market the DRP; the extent to which the strategy that was adopted to market the DRP effectively met its objectives; and, finally, the adequacy of current guidelines and practices for the letting and management of contracts in the circumstances of the marketing of the DRP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has considered evidence gathered in the course of public and in camera hearings and from submissions from interested parties. The Senate committee met with representatives of the various departments responsible for the disability reform project and with representatives from Corporate Impacts. Unfortunately, the senate committee could not hear evidence from Mr Michael Ward, who was a co-principal of Corporate Impacts Pty Ltd for much of the project, because we understand that he left the country in late 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A large proportion of the hearings and evidence provided to this committee was in camera. It would have been impossible to have produced a coherent report without reference to it. However, the committee took particular care to use only that information which it considered was not detrimental to individuals, companies or departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the expenditure of public funds by departments is a role which requires prudent and efficient management. The evidence relating in this case to the expenditure of nearly $5 million in public funds by the Departments of Social Security, Employment, Education and Training, and Human Services and Health, and the Office of Government Information and Advertising is of very grave concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has concluded that the selection of Corporate Impacts Pty Ltd emanated from a dubious selection process undertaken by the Office of Government Information and Advertising. The project was not advertised. Rather, OGIA used its own limited database from which to select this company. Corporate Impacts, along with several well known companies, was recommended to the Ministerial Committee on Government Information and Advertising as suitable. Eventually, Corporate Impacts was chosen over the others because of its unique proposal to use network marketing rather than traditional media to get the message about disability reform across. The committee found that the process through which departments recommended Corporate Impacts to ministers for approval was severely flawed and not in keeping with the existing commonwealth procurement guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contract for the marketing of the disability reform package was signed on 29 August 1991. From the evidence provided to the committee, it seems the contract was signed only after a drawn out process of negotiation and then only reluctantly by both parties because its provisions satisfied neither. The committee has concluded that the contract itself was poorly drafted and the negotiations associated with it were misleading and ill-advised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful company, Corporate Impacts Pty Ltd, was a relatively small, underresourced company whose two principals claimed to have experience in network marketing and working with government. It received a payment of $25,000 in public funds from OGIA even before the contract was signed. Apparently the funds were to enable it to carry on preliminary work. Extraordinarily, it also received a payment of $412,500 upon signing the contract&mdash;again apparently to cover work already commenced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee found that the management of the project was particularly ineffective. The departments established an incredibly cumbersome and bureaucratic committee system to administer the project, ignoring a specific ministerial direction to appoint a single project director. The relations between the parties to the project were strained if not openly hostile. The payment and acquittal process adopted was particularly troublesome and the departments continually called for changes in the process and held up payments to the contractor. The departments failed to recognise and act upon the early warning signs of Corporate Impacts' liquidity problems and, as a result, the company went into voluntary liquidation in May 1993, leaving considerable debts unpaid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has been informed that the full list of creditors numbers some 230. A total of $124,855 is listed as owing to partly secured creditors. The remaining creditors are unsecured and are owed debts ranging from $500,000, allegedly owed to Ms Anne Gorman, a former principal of the company, to amounts of $10 and $50. Mr Michael Ward, a former co-principal, is suing Corporate Impacts for $164,403.50 for wrongful dismissal. A company owned by Mr Ward and another former associate of Corporate Impacts, Mr Terry Borella, is also claiming damages from Corporate Impacts of $1,879,150. Many of the unsecured creditors are from small country towns such as Innisfail in North Queensland and Katherine in the Northern Territory. The damage done to the credibility of the disability programs involved in this project would be considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over $600,000 in quantifiable costs was expended by the departments in administering this project&mdash;in other words, over 10 per cent of its value. The committee believes that the disability reform marketing project achieved only very patchy positive outcomes and only in relation to people with disabilities and their carers. The committee doubts if anything was achieved in the wider community at all. With respect to the further contract let to Corporate Impacts by the Environment Protection Agency, the committee considers that the EPA failed in its duty to protect the Commonwealth's interests by not investigating the company's background and financial status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made a number of recommendations in the light of its investigation of these two consultancies. The committee particularly addressed the need for changes to the Commonwealth procurement guidelines to strengthen and clarify them. Further, the committee recommends changes in relation to the drafting of contracts to protect the Commonwealth's interests, and greater responsiveness, cooperation and involvement on the part of the Attorney-General's Department, including an examination of the contractual process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends measures to ensure that companies are accountable for claims made in tendering for projects in relation to their resources, staffing levels and experience. Recommendations are also made that departments train their staff in proper record keeping and the legal ramifications of contracting consultancy services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee recommends that the government response to this report specifically identifies all moneys considered to have been wrongly paid and that ministers of the relevant departments, including the Department of Administrative Services and the Office of Government Information and Advertising, clearly state the extent to which each of these departments failed to meet their responsibilities and the steps undertaken to correct this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the committee wishes to thank those individuals and organisations who made submissions and gave evidence at public hearings. I think this inquiry has thrown up a report that should be mandatory reading for those who wish to engage in the letting of contracts on behalf of the government and the taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report of the Community Affairs References Committee on matters pertaining to the marketing of the disability reform package is testimony to what I can only describe as a disgrace and a debacle, and the use of taxpayers' money with no real or apparent concern from many of the people involved, including the officers and, I have to say, also the ministers. It was a contract that was let, as Senator Herron has said, across three departments&mdash;DEET, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services, as it was then known, and the Department of Social Security&mdash;and, within DAS, the Office of Government Information and Advertising. Therein lies part of the story, which I will explain further down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 I expressed concern in Senate estimates hearings about the letting of the contract and also the progress of it. In 1991, 1992 and 1993 I asked question after question, and there were ministers sitting at the table when I asked those questions. Senator Richardson and Senator McMullan, who was not a minister at the time but who was there representing the minister as a parliamentary secretary, heard my questions. Minister after minister heard my questions and not one minister, it appears, inquired into the progress of that tender and the contract. We saw $5 million plus of taxpayers' money wasted down the gurgler. The goal that that contract was supposed to achieve&mdash;that is, the marketing of the disability reform package&mdash;was not achieved and that money did not go to do the job that it was supposed to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That $4.95 million contract was let to a company called Corporate Impacts to market the disability reform package in August 1991. Both of the principals of that company had worked in the Public Service. We read about one of them in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> in 1983, where it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a new private specialist consultancy service has been established to interpret the Australian Labor Party and its policies to local and international business.</PARA>
<PARA>Ms Gorman, who had set herself up as a company, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We want to act as a bridge between business and government, rather than as a lobbyist.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ward, who was one of the principals working in that company, had also worked in the Public Service and they purported to know how the Public Service worked. In fact, Ms Gorman wrote articles telling people how to negotiate with the government. We saw an absolute disaster when she actually set about doing it herself for a contract that I believe, and I think the committee believes, was far too large for the resources that that company had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departments involved in this project were DAS, OGIA, DEET, the Department of Human Services and Health and the Department of Social Security. It is estimated that these departments spent an additional $600,000 administering the project. So we not only have $4.95 million and a couple of other million, $1.5 million or $2 million, going to other companies that were also involved in the project, but we also have $600,000 of administrative costs on behalf of these departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see how many meetings the departments had. In May to June of 1992, I think the departments had eight meetings discussing the project. I have to say that the people on the committee, who had to painstakingly go through the many pages of estimates and the many pages of evidence that we were given, deserve credit for producing a document on which we could all agree, which outlined step-by-step this debacle. What we uncovered at each stage was just gross mismanagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, I questioned the circumstances surrounding the letting of the contract. As Senator Herron said, the project was not advertised&mdash;as honourable senators would expect under the Commonwealth's own procurement guidelines. A contract for $4.95 million should have been. Originally, the names of five prominent advertising agencies were put before the ministerial committee on government information and advertising, and the ministerial committee thought an alternative approach, other than the traditional advertising one, should be considered. I think Senator McMullan apparently said that what the committee wanted was `a new, fresh point of reference'&mdash;whatever that was supposed to mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">OGIA did not attempt to advertise the new approach or seek major experienced marketing firms&mdash;I think what the ministerial committee was complaining about was that it had approached advertising companies. So an officer of OGIA interrogated OGIA's database, which was totally inadequate&mdash;1,500 names of potential contractors&mdash;and came up with three names, two of which were too small and were not considered and one name which was recommended to the ministerial committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a couple of years ago now. I have files that stretch right across my office in Melbourne on this issue. One of my staff members rang the agencies and asked them whether they had been adequately informed about the shift from a traditional advertising approach to this network marketing or marketing approach or new reference point or whatever language we like to use. They said no, they had not. One of them told me that had it known there was a change in emphasis it would have withdrawn its tender, because that was not its style or its modus operandi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It transpired, virtually, that it was almost impossible for Corporate Impacts not to get the contract because all the others put in an advertising approach. In fact, when I looked at the letter that was sent to the advertising agencies and then at the contract, I found that it really was not clear that anything other than an advertising approach was wanted. The advertising agencies were asked for television shots. They were asked for radio blurbs that they might use&mdash;I have forgotten the terminology that one might use for this&mdash;but it was very much an advertising approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it transpired that Corporate Impacts was most probably the only company that was going to get this job, did OGIA bother to check up on the company? No. It made a few cursory phone calls around to other government agencies for which Corporate Impacts had undertaken some contracts&mdash;I think one of the contracts was for $150,000. The committee was told that if Corporate Impacts did a contract for $150,000 and it was okay, the company would be able to do one for $4.95 million. What baloney! What a disaster! If a company can undertake and achieve something on a $150,000 contract, is it therefore capable of doing one for $4.95 million?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then went to the ASC and asked it for the last return that Corporate Impacts had lodged prior to the letting of the contract. What do we find? We find that Corporate Impacts has more debts than it has assets. When I sought advice from an accountant, who happened to be my father&mdash;our resources are a bit limited in this game&mdash;he said to me, `If I were a bank manager, I would not lend them money.' We are giving them a contract for $4.95 million of taxpayers' money. The company was not in a position to undertake the contract. Nobody in any of the departments nor any minister felt a responsibility for the fact that this company was given a contract when it was not capable of actually undertaking it. No checks were made. A Dun and Bradstreet check was not done. It was an absolute disgrace. At no time did OGIA really attempt to investigate the bona fides of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I questioned officers at length in estimates and during the inquiry to determine why no investigation was undertaken and who accepted responsibility. Guess what? The officers gave me no reasons and the responsibility was really nobody's because there was a management committee with a chairman. I stand to be corrected, but I think one officer said to me at one point, `Well, I was a chairman, but I didn't have voting rights' or `I wasn't in a position to vote.' We had a chairman who did not really know what his role was. We had members from the three managing departments and those staff changed. Really, nobody was responsible. The blame could not be sheeted home to anybody and that is a great criticism of this whole matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departments responsible for the contract set up a committee that I described at one point in estimates as a camel. It was a bureaucratic nightmare. There were changes in staff membership and a lack of clarity about authority and lines of responsibilities. In fact, the committee was like an amoeba: it changed. At one point it involved people on Corporate Impacts and then it decided that was not very good and it would have meetings without Corporate Impacts. So it was very difficult for us to really define what the management committee was.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a project manager was supposed to be appointed and the ministerial advisory committee said that a project manager should be appointed. We never got a decent answer as to why a project manager was not appointed. Nobody could answer that. The buck did not stop there either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that absolutely astounded me was, as I discovered in estimates, that the Commonwealth had paid Corporate Impacts $25,000 prior to the contract even being signed. I believe this to be totally inappropriate. So Corporate Impacts had $25,000. I asked what would happen if the contract had not been signed. One officer told me, `Well, senator, we would have had to take measures to get the money back.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it had been that officer's $25,000 worth of superannuation, I wonder whether he would have been so generous with it. If he were building a house, would he have decided to give the builder $25,000 before the contract was signed because the builder needed to buy a bit of equipment? The answer is no. But he did it with the taxpayers' money. With the taxpayers' money, $25,000 was paid before the contract was signed. I had some stairs built at the back of my house. I would not have done that, but it is my money. What every officer of the Commonwealth and every member of this parliament ought to know is that the money that they spend is not their money. It is the money of the citizens of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I raised this matter in the estimates in 1991, 1992 and 1993 and there was no real action on the part of the departments involved or the ministers responsible for these departments until Corporate Impacts announced its voluntary liquidation. I asked questions in estimates ad nauseam about what I thought were extraordinarily high head hour charges being made by the principals of the company. We were told that if it is a very short contract, often there are very high head hours in advertising and marketing but that usually a company, if it has a contract over a longer period, will offer a discount for head hours because it is not starting on a new contract or a new job and for all sorts of other reasons. But there was no attempt, it appears, to negotiate down those head hours. I believe the departments could have negotiated a lower fee for a contract of this length and size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The departments of Human Services and Health and Social Security sought to terminate the contract as early as 1991. I was advised in estimates that during the period May to June there were innumerable meetings&mdash;from memory I think about eight, but I cannot be certain of that&mdash;over a period of about five weeks, which discussed the termination of the contract. It transpired that DEET was opposed to such action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I watched the people answering the questions during the estimates process, I felt that they did not look comfortable. When people are skating on the circumference of the truth and trying not to tell people exactly what they want to know, one can often tell that that is the case. I was very interested to know why DEET as a department wanted to keep the contract going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I asked why the contract was not terminated and when two of the three departments&mdash;including the Department of Social Security, which was paying the most money&mdash;wanted to terminate it, I was told, `Oh, Senator, we needed a consensus'. Imagine what would happen if I, as a director of a company, were to go the shareholders and say, `We have made a $5 million bungle. We realised fairly early down the track that it was a bit of a disaster, but there were three people on the committee and another one who did not know whether or not he had a vote. We could not get a consensus between the three that were supposed to vote, and only two said that we should terminate it, so we did not do so.' We all know what the shareholders would say: `It's time you found another job. We don't need you as a director of our company.' I am sure that Senator Gibson, with his business experience, would agree with me that that is exactly what the shareholders would say. The view was, `We haven't a consensus, so we will go ambling down the track with this contract that appears to be a failure. We will keep spending taxpayers' money in this way because we have not got consensus.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell senators why there was not consensus. It was at this point of time that a Mr Sid Hickman came into it. I suggested at one point, when I was becoming a little weary of the whole thing, that we could write a soapie called `The Contract'&mdash;for a whole lot of other reasons that I will not bring up in the chamber at present. Mr Sid Hickman appeared on the scene who, it transpires, had been employed by Corporate Impacts. He appears to have lobbied, I do not know who, but officers said it was not the officers. I presume it could have been Minister Beazley, who was then the minister for education. But for some unknown reason DEET was not going along with the termination of the contract. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that Mr Hickman used to work for Mr Beazley, then he worked for Dr Carmen Lawrence, and after that for Corporate Impacts. I do not know what else he did in between but he eventually went back to Mr Beazley. I think it is inappropriate that DEET would not agree to the termination of the contract. I do not believe the evidence given by the department in the estimates hearings warranted the strength of its response in saying that the contract should not be terminated. The other two departments really had no other option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning to the end, the letting of this contract was a disgrace and a debacle. Satisfactory answers have not been given to explain, for example, that while the contract stipulated that Corporate Impacts be paid on a monthly basis&mdash;that is $200,000 per month&mdash;all except $62,000 of the $4.95 million designated for the contract had been paid to Corporate Impacts by February 1993, even though the contract was not to end until July 1993. What they intended to do from February to July is beyond my comprehension. So all but $62,000 of the contract was paid out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the project relations between the departments and Corporate Impacts apparently became quite bad. It was decided to water down the minutes of the meetings to make them records of decisions. That is what was being done by this camel of a committee; it was its attempt to improve things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Corporate Impacts also had poor accounting procedures and acquittals and that became a major source of contention with the project during the two years 1991-93. The fault most probably lies in both camps, with the departments not knowing what they wanted or needed, and the company being under-resourced to carry out the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was astonishing that such relations and such poor acquittal procedures emanated from Corporate Impacts when both its principals, Ms Anne Gorman and Mr Michael Ward&mdash;and the committee was unhappy that Mr Ward was not available to answer questions that the committee wished to put to him&mdash;claimed to have extensive experience in working with government. The committee felt so strongly about this that it has recommended that consultants who cannot deliver the product or who provide false and misleading information about their skills be prevented from tendering for any Commonwealth work for five years. It is astonishing that Mr Ward is not around to face the music, having left the country in late 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another part of the whole saga is that Mr Ward is suing Corporate Impacts for $164,403.50 for wrongful dismissal. Another of his companies, of which Mr Terry Borella appears to be a co-director and was so far as the ASC was concerned until a couple of weeks ago, Yardmont Pty Ltd, is suing Corporate Impacts to the tune of $1,879,150. Ms Gorman is seeking $500,000 from her own company; the tax man wants $64,000 in unpaid group tax. Former staff are owed $52,814 in superannuation, and there is a claim in for $18,276 in other expenses. There is unlikely to be much left. Also the office told us that there were `deliverables' that had not been delivered to the Commonwealth. Unsecured creditors across Australia, some of whom gave evidence to the committee in a public hearing, are likely to receive nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of them are very small groups representing people with disabilities. Some people told us how their group's creditability in the community had taken a battering because they had put on a function and were not paid. Other people were asked to provide catering, printing and other services and were left with the bill. It is hardly a good way to advertise a disability reform package, especially when departments were paying Corporate Impacts in advance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One should ask: where did the money go and did anybody benefit from a windfall? I will tell honourable senators who did not benefit, and that was people with disabilities and taxpayers. They are the two lots of people that we should be most concerned about in this chamber. After all, the project was supposed to centre on people with disabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee was informed that over $600,000 was spent on quantifiable administration costs by departments for the package. Also, one has to budget in the cost to the Senate of the inquiry&mdash;namely, the costs of staff, the travel, and the time we as senators have spent and the staff time that has been expended on this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the formal post project evaluations of the package found that most people found out about the reforms from the traditional departmental networks. The target groups were doctors, employers, people with disabilities, carers who were to be told about the government's program in increasing the employment of people with disabilities in open employment, or increasing the opportunities so to do. They did not find out as a result of the expenditure of $4.95 million of taxpayers' money. Instead, they found out from the traditional networks of departments through the disabilities sector. They were the people who alerted me to the fact that there was a problem. They kept on saying, `Money is being given out and we in the disability sector are not hearing about it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the ministers of relevant departments, including DAS and OGIA, clearly state the extent to which each of their departments failed to meet their responsibilities and the specific steps they intend to take to correct this. As Senator Herron said, this report should be a prescribed text book for all students in public policy. The Senate estimates hearings should be prescribed reading too because they tell the story behind this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to read to the Senate a quote that Ms Anne Gorman, the author of a report on management consultants entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The secret army</EMPHASIS>, made in about September 1989. There is irony in it:</PARA>

<PARA>She was talking about consultancies. Is that not ironic? One pays out all this money and there is nothing to show for it. We have paid out $4.95 million and there is nothing to show for it. Perhaps it shows that this is a debacle and a disgrace and that people with disabilities have been left carrying the can.

<PARA>These amendments are directed towards the issue of video game rentals. We are moving to delete new subsection 31(4), which exempts video game cartridges from the exclusive rental right provisions. Unlike the case of CDs, where there was some doubt whether they were valid under the provisions of GATT&mdash;although we feel that the government should have taken the course of action to challenge the provisions and accept the amendments that the Democrats moved&mdash;this one is a much clearer case. It is very obvious that they are valid under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Video game cartridges are not copyable. There is a South African court ruling that they are in the nature of cinematographic works. Non-copyable cinematographic works are specifically excluded from the exclusive rental rights provisions of the TRIPS agreement. In addition, both the United States and Canada have legislation which excludes video game cartridges from the exclusive rental rights provisions of copyright law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we are moving to introduce a system whereby video game cartridge rental operators will be forced to pay a one-off up-front royalty fee for the right to rent out the cartridge. By moving for the deletion of proposed new subsection 31(4)&mdash;this is in clause 4(b) of the current bill&mdash;we effectively exclude non-copyable computer programs, including video game cartridges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New subsection 31(3) exempts from the exclusive rental right `a machine or device in which a computer program is embodied if the program is not able to be copied in the course of the ordinary use of the machine or device'. This is obviously aimed at situations like computer programs that control car engines. Obviously we do not want to have to get the permission of the copyright owner for the program in order to rent a car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New subsection 31(4) then makes it clear that 31(3) is not intended to apply to devices that are usually used to store computer programs such as floppy discs, cartridges, CD-ROMs, integrated circuits and so on. By deleting subsection 31(4), programs stored on these devices are excluded from the exclusive rental rights so long as they are not copyable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rest of the amendment describes a mechanism based on a compulsory 10 per cent up-front premium paid by rental operators when they buy the video cartridge. In return, they get a sticker for the video cartridge which states that it is authorised for rental use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that the minister will be able to respond to the questions that are raised by these amendments, because I feel the government would have a hard time to justify opposing an amendment that does a number of things. First of all, it ensures a reward to copyright holders. This is an issue that we are very concerned about. In the CD issue the government ensured that but it lost the other two, because our amendments will also provide consumer access to a rental market. In the case of CDs, the government lost that. Thirdly, it will provide protection for the interest of legitimate existing businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the provisions are legal under TRIPS, so why on earth would the government oppose these amendments? Why would the government not accept them? It is very clear, it seems to me, that we have taken every precaution to ensure that we cannot be attacked by those who think that GATT must be observed to the nth degree. The other substantive reasons stand on their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me run again through the reasons why it is TRIPS-consistent. TRIPS exempts non-copyable cinematographic work from the exclusive rental right. Video game cartridges are non-copyable. Video games have been ruled by South African courts to be in the nature of cinematographic work. The United States and Canada both currently exempt video game cartridges from such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we argue that video games can be exempted and obviously should be exempted from the exclusive right. There are something like 200,000-plus consumers involved in video game rentals. Many of these video games are educational. Video games cost 20 to 30 times as much to buy as to rent. The market is dominated by two main players, Sega and Nintendo, who would have the market power to end the video game rental market at the stroke of a pen, and I am sure they will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the argument for the government's support on this is overwhelming. But let me not forget the coalition parties. We have an issue here where it is TRIPS-consistent, where video games are educational, where the cost to buy video games is beyond the reach of many people that would like to enjoy them or have derived from them some educational benefit. The copyright holders are being compensated. So why on earth would the coalition parties not support the amendment? I commend my amendments 3 and 4 to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because I gather that, in terms of the agreement that people have reached for this bill, we have only some 25 minutes to go. My advice in respect of Senator Spindler's amendments is as follows. In respect of No. 3, concerning the deletion of the provisions of the new section 31(4), it must be remembered that 31(4) is to be a limitation on clause 31(3). Those two subsections, I am informed, have to be read together. Read together, they provide a specific instance of the more general exemption provided in 31(5), that is, that the rental right does not apply where the computer program is not the essential object of the rental. I am told that to leave in 31(3) without that 31(4) qualification would be inconsistent with the TRIPS requirement in article 11. My further advice&mdash;I am sure Senator Spindler might disagree with this&mdash;is that that is not possible under the agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of No. 4, I am informed that the effect of his amendment would be to reduce the exclusive right to a compulsory licence. We have to keep in mind there that the right to be granted is very much an exclusive right. We, as I think Senator Spindler acknowledged, argued during the negotiations for some sort of equitable remuneration scheme, but we did not succeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that, if we are implementing the TRIPS agreement, it is not possible to have such a scheme as an alternative to the exclusive right. I am also told that the exemption in the USA&mdash;a country which permits this sort of thing&mdash;is about to be reviewed. The advice in respect of both of these matters is inconsistent with the TRIPS agreement. I can say to Senator Spindler that the government can undertake to keep both of these matters under close scrutiny and review. Of course, honourable senators will have the capacity to raise them at a later stage once this matter evolves. That is the advice I have to offer to Senator Spindler. </PARA>

Does the government think that people should be forced to pay hundreds of dollars for a video game&mdash;whether they are recreational or educational&mdash;rather than be allowed to rent it?

Australia has gone further than those nations by going for an exclusive right which would usurp the rental rights of companies such as CD libraries. Our government is happy to decimate our rental records industries. In Perth we have a number of rental record and CD libraries, some that have been set up under the new enterprise scheme and others just by individual entrepreneurial initiative. But they will cease to exist after this legislation is passed. </PARA>

It should be understood by this chamber that we are talking about the ordinary people of Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is where we will not come to an agreement. I think Senator Harradine recognises that.

<PARA>Since the Senate could not see its way to allowing the rental industry to exist in Australia, there is something we should do as a minimum for those who have invested their money and efforts in this industry. The current legislation makes these people exempt in respect of their existing stock. Proposed subsection (6)(a) ensures that they cannot buy new rental stock, so they are already in trouble; (6)(b) ensures that no new business can be started, even with exempt records; (6)(c) seeks to ensure that the owners of existing businesses cannot sell or transfer them. This last measure seems unreasonably hard on a business person we have just driven out of business. There is some possibility that such renters could continue in business as renters if they confined their stock to old, classic stock. But even if they did that and scraped by, or managed to reduce their loss, this would effectively prohibit the selling of an existing business, even though that business was effectively being crippled. The Greens proposed amendment would reverse that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of timing, it is our understanding that there is a one-year transition period on intellectual property. The passage of this bill should constitute an indication of intent, and one year certainly should provide adequate time to put something in place. In any case, the way we have set this proposed amendment, there is no condition on passage of the bill, nor does it require the government to determine the mechanism for allowing rental. It could be by way of voluntary regulation by industry, as long as it meets the criterion of establishing a reasonable regime for rental outlets. This amendment would simply make rental agencies exempt unless some type of regime, voluntary or legislated, is established. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment may prove redundant if the existing provisions of the act are interpreted in certain ways, but I cannot see from the way the bill is drafted how or where such simple things are exempt. Section 135 appears draconian, allowing copyright holders to make some kind of ambit claim and expecting customs officers to go through people's bags and pockets to check that they do not have any copyright goods for which they do not have licences.

<PARA>This amendment is designed to give some recourse to the actual artists&mdash;the musicians, programmers and creators&mdash;in situations where massive profits are made by record companies, software companies, film companies, and so on, without their passing on the benefits to those artists to any substantial extent. The amendment would create a provision through which the artists could challenge the companies that dominate production and marketing. The plaintive letters from ARIA and other bodies are concerned particularly with these issues. If we make the ability of the corporations and companies who co-own the intellectual property stronger without increasing the ability of the creators of that property, the outcome is obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is full of stories of people who have been paid a minor fee for work from which a company has made millions. This is not fair and it is certainly not the intention of copyright to allow companies to exploit artists. The amendment would create a provision which would allow a challenge to be mounted against a big company when that company uses its dominance and monopoly power to effectively charge massive profits and set prices at levels not related to the actual cost of production and marketing. Anyone who has ever looked at pirated goods in Asia would know that if those people can charge the prices that they do, it is certainly the case that the cost to big companies of production, distribution and marketing does not explain the prices we see in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation can only be described as the making of super profits by these big companies through monopoly power. We are trying to create some redress for the situation, and we are doing it in light of the intention to extend copyright powers in various ways. It is important that we act to ensure that copyright is more than a licence for big corporations to print money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a conversation I had yesterday with a journalist who said, `What are you talking about? In terms of copyright there will not be any real changes for the rights of those people who create work.' I link that in my mind to the fact that we have had innumerable debates in this chamber about the rights of sovereignty and the ability of the Commonwealth government, as established under High Court rulings, to make decisions in regard to treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said to a person the other day that the government certainly has these powers but that does not mean that we, as the parliament, cannot be allowed to look at these interests of sovereignty. It was explained that there has never been an instance where the most powerful in an operation, especially in the case of government, gives up that power. Therefore, it can well be argued that if in this case we give the corporations and co-owners of intellectual property greater power, there is no doubt in the world that they will not use that power against the creators of that intellectual property. Those people who think they are going to get more benefits from this have another think coming. At some time in the future they will come to us and ask for protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sad about the situation. But I would like to give this final opportunity to the government to think carefully about the implications of creating greater corporate power at the expense of the people&mdash;the musicians, programmers, creators, artists and writers&mdash;who actually create the goods that are of value, and do something to make sure that they get some benefit from their work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are lending very strong support to this amendment. Not so very long ago the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made a statement expressing strong support for people engaged in cultural activities in Australia. The message that that gave was certainly one that the arts and people engaged in them are of great importance to the further development of Australia as a nation and the development of our national identity.</PARA></TALK.START>

I cannot think of an amendment that would be more suited to sending a message to people engaged in these activities that there is some concern to ensure that they are not exploited by people who have greater market power than they have. This amendment would provide some shifting in that balance and I call on the minister to respond positively to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just briefly again, my advice is that the provisions which are encompassed by new clause 9A seem to propose the inalienability of rights of the original creator of the work but that the assignment of copyright is fundamental to its character as intellectual property. I think people would understand that. The other problem with this proposal is that it does not distinguish between creators of works and performers. These are, after all, categories presently used in the act and recognised internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am further advised that it is probably contrary to international conventions to allow a person other than the copyright owner, such as, of course, the creator who has assigned his or her copyright, to have such an action as proposed, as it interferes with the exclusive rights of a matter not contemplated as being permitted. In essence, the advice I have is that the concepts that are introduced through this particular amendment are somewhat radical and do turn some aspects of copyright law on its head. It may be appropriate for these concepts to be pursued through the already announced review of the Copyright Act by the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr). That is the advice that I have, and I offer it to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak very briefly to the issue of making payments available to the defence forces, which, some senators will remember, was debated here some time ago. At that time the Democrats supported the government position, which was that certain fringe benefits should be counted as income in terms of qualification for payments. The Democrats supported that position, particularly because we did not believe that any categories of employees should be exempted&mdash;that all should be caught up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now discover that the government, in fact, is exempting one category of employee; that is, employees of the Defence Force. Therefore, we believe that the principle on which we supported the government has been broken. I would indicate to the government that at some later stage the Democrats would want to grant the exemption, in this case being granted to the Defence Force, to other categories of employees because I believe the principle still remains. If some categories of employees are to be granted exemption from that test, others should also be given the same exemption. So I indicate that at a later stage the Democrats will want to talk to the government about that and perhaps move along that line. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But for those numbered 16 to 19 inclusive, the amendments moved by the government have no real substantive effects and are largely consequential upon the introduction of various other pieces of legislation also arising from the budget and the white paper. Amendments 16 to 19 modify part of the activity test applicable to jobsearch and newstart allowance recipients in a positive way. Accordingly, the coalition will not oppose this package of amendments, nor will the coalition oppose the four government amendments to this bill which were circulated last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have anticipated this very moment for some time, as I am sure the advisers have also. Those amendments, which were circulated last week in this chamber, concern loan and housing loan fringe benefits where these are provided to employees of the Defence Force and have the effect of exempting such employees from some of the general provisions that would otherwise apply to such benefits. The housing fringe benefit provisions regarding rental payments made by the employer will, however, continue to apply to the Defence Force employees. </PARA>

<PARA>The government's bill provides that a person will only have to serve one liquid assets waiting period in any 12-month period. As I said, the Democrats welcome this. But as the assets of a couple are addressed jointly, we believe it needs to be extended. So the amendments I am moving simply provide that where a person or their partner has served the liquid assets waiting period within the last 12 months that person will not be required to serve another similar waiting period. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.Schedule 3, page 12, item 3, proposed paragraph 1069-D2(ba), omit the paragraph.</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment concerns the entitlement of families to additional family payment whilst they are travelling overseas. As was covered in the debate on the bill, the government intends that a family continue to receive additional family payment when they travel overseas if, and only if, the child remains in Australia. I think there are two points to make about this. Firstly, it hardly seems a worthy objective in this, the International Year of the Family, to be penalising families who wish to remain together as they travel as, of course, most families will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, what we are talking about here are families whose incomes are so low that they qualify for additional family payment. Obviously, these families are not the sort who take skiing trips to the French alps each year. If these families are able to afford an overseas trip, it is no doubt because they have made considerable sacrifices in other areas to save the money. This could be the case, for example, where a child is chosen to represent a school sporting team that is travelling overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government appears to say that it is okay for high income parents to continue to receive their basic family payment while they ski down the French slopes with their kids. The Democrats do not object to that. But the government then turns around and says to low income families that if they take their kids overseas or if their child should want to travel overseas with a school group, for example, they will not qualify for their full family payments. I know the government recognises this gross inconsistency, and I suspect that the only reason it is not rectifying this problem is a budgetary one. The Democrats believe this issue must be addressed, so I have introduced this amendment which will allow low income families to continue to receive their additional family payment where their child travels overseas.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not accept this amendment from Senator Woodley and the Democrats. The arguments are principally, as we have said on a number of occasions, that the AFP is essentially to assist families to avoid poverty. It is targeted at low income families and paid to families in Australia and not families outside Australia. So while there has been some change in this payment, particularly for sole parents so that there is a shift and a recognition at that level, there is not an intention or a preparedness by government to move to what Senator Woodley is proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>

I recognise the point Senator Woodley makes, but the government is not prepared to be persuaded that payments to families outside Australia are justifiable at this time. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments relate to the way in which a family's eligibility for family payments is determined. Under the current system the family payment income test is based on taxable income for the previous year. I understand that this system is used primarily because of its administrative simplicity and its ease of understanding. It means that people can assess whether or not they are likely to be eligible simply by reference to their last tax assessment notice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, a couple of circumstances in which a person can ask the department to have another look at their financial situation. One of those situations is where the family's income is likely to change by more than 25 per cent since last year. This could happen where, for example, a woman gives up her work to have a child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me&mdash;and I have received representations on this&mdash;is that a family could have a substantial drop in income, say, 20 per cent, taking them below the income test threshold, but still remain ineligible for the family payment. They accept the administrative benefits of the department setting a certain percentage drop in income, but it seems to me that 25 per cent may be just too high a level. These amendments will lower that 25 per cent to 15 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, if a family's income drops by 15 per cent or more, taking it under the family payment threshold, it will become eligible for a payment. I know that Senator Newman has raised this issue in the Senate previously and I pay tribute to her for doing so. I hope that my amendments will have the support of both opposition and government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the obvious injustice that is inherent in the current legislation&mdash;that is the phrase that should have been added by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley)&mdash;the committee has before it a matter that has been raised by Senator Woodley. It is clear that the way in which the current income test operates denies to persons who, at the particular time, on any measure ought to be able to receive family payment and yet they are denied such payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one talks about universal payments and income testing, one should bear in mind that such a system has been operating in Australia for a considerable time. The family payment is really a recognition of the fact that a family with children is a more expensive operation than a family without children. It goes some way to recognising that it is unfair to tax the necessities of life in respect of a particular child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of this payment goes back many years. Previously a tax allowance was provided for families with children in respect of each child. This then turned into a tax rebate. We would not be talking about this item today if it were still a tax rebate. But in fact the rebate was cashed up into a family allowance. I agreed with that at the time when it happened in 1976. The social security shadow minister at the time also agreed&mdash;and of course at the time Labor was in opposition. The then Labor shadow minister expressed concern as to cashing up this payment into family allowance, which is now family payments. Concern was expressed that this would be eroded, and in fact that is what has happened. The position has been eroded and billions of dollars have been taken out of the purses of mothers by successive governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now face a situation where, because of the income test, there is an anomaly. One could have a family suffering a substantial drop in income. This could take such a family below the income test threshold, yet the family would still remain ineligible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will refer to them briefly. Tables Nos 1, 3 and 4 show the effect of the white paper arrangements that are contained in this bill. We can see from them that single people with low private incomes can be up to $10.50 per week worse off while couples can be up to $17.50 per week worse off. Tables Nos 2, 5 and 6 set out the result of my amendments being accepted. They clearly show that we can maintain the incentive for people to take on more work or take on low paid full-time work without so harshly hitting those lower down the income scale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People on lower incomes will still be slightly worse off than under the existing arrangements, but not nearly as badly as they would be under the income test put forward in the white paper and contained in this legislation. We have to remember that generally people are not able to pick and choose how much part-time work they take on. The argument in the white paper that those disadvantaged by the income test changes can simply increase their working hours is totally unrealistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EM says that the income test changes, together with individual entitlement to benefits for each member of a couple, will save the government nearly $100 million per year. Most of these savings will be due to changes in behaviour; that is, people will take on more work and, therefore, receive lower social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment I am proposing is modest. If anything, it will increase the motivation for people to take on more work. I have been encouraged in my efforts on this issue by the fact that the opposition has recognised the harshness to low income earners and has spoken out about this on a number of occasions. So I simply say to the opposition, `If you are genuine in your concern for these unemployed people, you will support this amendment.' I say to the government, `This amendment maintains all the positive aspects of the changes you are proposing but eases the detrimental effect that those changes will have on the lowest paid unemployed people.'</PARA>

<PARA>While the Democrats welcome the new widow allowance, we believe that there is a group of women&mdash;a small group, but a significant group nonetheless&mdash;who have been unfairly left out of eligibility for the allowance. This group includes those older single women who have been caring for another person&mdash;other than a spouse&mdash;for many years and have been receiving a carers pension. My concern is what happens to these women when the person they are caring for dies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current arrangements, these women would be forced into the job queues and have to confront the hoops and hurdles attached to the jobsearch allowance. The Democrats see this as inequitable and believe that these women need to be given some additional support from our social security system. Let me reiterate my point: we are talking about women who are 50 years or over who have no recent work force experience, due to the fact that they have been caring for another person for a number of years, sometimes for up to 30 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the widow allowance was first announced, I have received a couple of letters from women in precisely these types of circumstances.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that these women should also be eligible for the allowance, for the same reason that the government used when introducing both the widow allowance and the revised non-activity tested partner allowance: that is, because of commitments outside the traditional work force, these women may not have the skills required to adequately participate in the current job market. My amendments will allow women who are 50 years or older who have been on a carers pension and who have no recent work force experience to claim the new widow allowance should the person they are caring for die. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats' amendments Nos 10 to 12 would extend availability of the widow allowance to women previously on a carers pension after the person cared for dies. We believe that this would be a tortuous extension of the widow allowance, and the coalition does not support it as the way to help carers. The coalition enjoys a very good relationship with the Carers Association and listens very carefully to what it has to say. It is an organisation which represents about 1.5 million carers, making its contribution Australia wide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, one of the concerns we also have with these amendments is that a significant proportion of carers in this country are men. Some estimates put the figure at around 40 per cent. We believe that these amendments could effectively discriminate against that group whilst not addressing the issues pertinent to the majority of women carers. Accordingly, we oppose the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government also opposes these amendments. I want to reiterate first of all the last point that Senator Patterson raised. On the evidence provided to me, it is assessed that men actually constitute about 60 per cent of carer pensioners. Of course, it would be very inequitable to all of those men if these amendments were passed. Men who are aged 50 years or over would be in a similarly disadvantaged position following the death of the person they had cared for if they had been out of the work force for an extended period because of their caring responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also be inappropriate to women. Senator Woodley gave an example of a married person who was caring for elderly relatives, such as parents. In that case, it would be inappropriate to place such a woman who had never been widowed, divorced or separated onto a widow allowance. In fact, some carer pensioners who cease to care may still be partnered, adding a significant further complication. Extending the widow allowance in this way would introduce inconsistencies that may require further fundamental changes to the nature of the payment. For these reasons, we oppose the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was expecting Senator Crowley to respond to Senator Woodley, but there has been no response. I think what Senator Woodley said was quite reasonable. There are anomalies in the current system. It has been pointed out. Senator Woodley is trying to address the particular problem that has been raised. We all know about it, and he is trying to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What bothers me about this place is that the government's responses very often do not address the problem. The government satisfies itself that amendments which try to address the problem might have some difficulties or might cause a few problems. They might, but they will overcome a heck of a lot more. If the government, with its army of civil servants, is able to mention a couple of problems that might emerge as a result of the passage of these amendments, why has it not come up with a proposition that will overcome those minor difficulties? That is what we need to look at from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not the font of all wisdom when it comes to legislating to overcome problems. Very often, the government does not say, `We are not going to deal with this problem.' It does not deny that there is a problem, but it does not say, `We are not going to deal with this problem.' It says, `There is going to be a problem here and perhaps one there,' or `The bill is not properly drafted,' or `It might result in a minor problem here or there.'</PARA>

<PARA>As in previous bills that have been brought to this place that are part of the social security package, these bills have what the Greens view as a most inappropriate usage of prison penalties. The two amendments that the Greens present are for prison penalties to be replaced with fines in the form of penalty units. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we have done this is that, firstly, we believe it is not appropriate to have prison penalties within the Social Security Act. The Crimes Act provides for penalties when offences of a sufficient order involve some kind of fraud or misappropriation of money. These are clearly not applicable in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments refer to two proposed sections of the bill. One is proposed section 951(6) on page 28, which says that prison penalties apply for the failure to comply with a notice requiring a person to provide the Department of Social Security a statement concerning matters relating to the benefit. The second proposed section is 408JC(6) on page 138, where there is a gender specific penalty because it relates to the widow allowance. Apparently the prison penalties there are prescribed for the same reason as in the other case&mdash;the failure to provide a statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that exposes how ridiculous these provisions are and we urge the chamber to support these proposed amendments. There is no justification for using prison penalties in this bill. There is no justification for using the deterrence argument. It is quite obvious that people will not see this as an appropriate way of enforcing their compliance with statements relating to their benefits. We have to assume that people who are filling in these details have made a mistake. If we do not, we are assuming that they are guilty and not even allowing them a case by inserting these provisions as a deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I urge my colleagues in the chamber to support these amendments. I will continue to address these inappropriate penalties whenever they are included in these bills until, at some point, we all see the light and refuse to do it. If any honourable senators are thinking that fines for social security misdemeanours of this kind are utterly inappropriate because the people may already be suffering, so be it. Let that be the message. If fines are inappropriate, surely prison penalties are even worse. I urge honourable senators to support my amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know it is the end of the session but usually when there are amendments it is a courtesy that those amendments are circulated outside the chamber to the various parties so that we all have time to look at them. In this case, this is the first time I have seen the amendments. I do not know whether there was any attempt to circulate them. I have seen independent senators go ape when amendments have been dropped on them without notice. I am not going ape, but I am expressing my dissatisfaction and concern that I have not had time to look at these amendments. With the disability wage supplement bill, the Greens attempted to make similar amendments and, from memory, the coalition opposed them. Senator Chamarette's current amendments are substituting a fine penalty for a gaol penalty, which is a maximum of six months, for the offence of failing to comply with a notice issued by the department and requiring the person to provide a statement about matters that might affect payment of parenting allowance to that person. The amendments do the same in the context of the widow allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I said on the earlier occasion&mdash;I do not want to be held to it&mdash;that the clause allows for a fine and/or a gaol sentence to be imposed. The argument we made then was that there was the option of either a fine and/or a gaol sentence. On that occasion, the disability wage supplement bill, we opposed the Greens' amendments. I refer anybody who wants a fuller explanation of why the coalition will be opposing these amendments to that debate. I ask that the Greens, if it is at all possible, circulate their amendments beforehand in order to give us time to consider them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about penalties, I would like to raise one other point. It is usual for the coalition to put a note in a penalty amendment so that anybody reading the legislation will know where to go to check what the penalty entails. I do not know whether that is covered here because these are amendments to a social security bill. If it is not, I ask the government either to fix that situation or to undertake that next time the penalty will be accompanied by a note so that people reading the legislation will know where to go to find out what the penalty units entail and how much they will be up for if they incur one of these penalties. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to indicate that the Australian Democrats will be supporting these amendments. I am amazed that we cannot see the commonsense in them. Every article on and investigation or research into this matter shows how inappropriate it is to gaol people for these kinds of offences. I take it&mdash;Senator Chamarette might like to give me this assurance later&mdash;that we are not talking about major fraud, which is covered under other sections of legislation and under other sections of the criminal code. We are talking about misdemeanours. We are talking about sending people to gaol, even when they may have inadvertently committed a misdemeanour. It is just totally inappropriate even to be considering gaoling people for those kinds of offences. I really cannot understand that the opposition and the government cannot see the sense in the amendments. It just bothers me.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to Senator Patterson's query. My understanding is that these amendments were circulated in the chamber on 30 November. I think it is part of our democratic right in the process of discussion that, even if we think of an amendment at the point where it is relevant to the debate, we should be able to bring it in. So I do not agree with her; I made an endeavour to circulate these amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that this is an issue that will recur whenever there is an inappropriate use of prison penalties. We have to bear in mind that women are going to prison for social security fraud in inordinate and over-represented proportions. That is not due to these measures, which are so minor as not necessarily to lead to that, but the kind of punitive attitude that underlies the approach to social security legislation reflects the unwillingness of the major parties in this chamber to accept the situations of genuine concern raised by Senator Woodley in the Democrats' amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very rich for Senator Patterson to suggest that, by leaving the situation as it is&mdash;with six months gaol or a fine&mdash;we are actually benefiting the possible recipients of these penalties because we are giving them a choice. I do not know whether Senator Patterson has seen <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sophie's Choice</EMPHASIS>, but that is remarkably what this is like. However, that is not the point. I do not believe that these penalties should ever be implemented. That is another reason that it would be more sensible not to have them in the legislation and to leave the most serious offences to be appropriately dealt with under the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another argument I thought of while I was listening to Senator Patterson's response, which occurred to me because of the response to an earlier amendment from Senator Woodley. If the cost to the government is the major factor influencing the way people vote on these amendments, I ask honourable senators to please bear in mind that the cost to the state and to the community of having gaol penalties is far greater than the cost that would be incurred if we showed the compassion needed to change this legislation in the ways that have been suggested in the discussion today. </PARA>

At no point did Senator Patterson say that we were being kind to a person who had committed a fraud by giving them choice. The choice lies with the magistrate who deals with the offence.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation refers to a fine or gaol, but the point is this: at the end of the day, the person who deals with the offence will make the decision. Let me make one thing very clear. We had this debate before, in relation to people who commit social security fraud through disability payments, and the argument we heard from the Greens then was, `Isn't it terrible that people in wheelchairs should go to gaol.' If people in wheelchairs commit fraud on the Commonwealth, they should be subject to the same penalties as everybody else.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Chamarette means the Crimes Act. There are various ways in which such matters can be dealt with, depending on whether they are dealt with on indictment or dealt with summarily. But even if matters are dealt with summarily, if people are recalcitrants they should reap the consequences of their actions. This is really quite silly.

We are not lacking in compassion but we believe that there should be appropriate penalties under the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I must turn to the argument that Senator Chamarette made about the cost to the taxpayer, as though cost should be the only determinant of the penalty that is applied. Senator Chamarette said, `We should look at the cost to the taxpayer of putting these people in gaol.' If we follow that argument to its logical conclusion, then provided the cost of the frauds or the mischiefs that have been perpetrated are less than the cost of sending the perpetrators to gaol, we do not send them to gaol. That is the logical consequence of the argument. We see that as silly. Accordingly, Senator Patterson's remarks stand. </PARA>

<PARA>When calculating the rate of the parenting allowance, income of both members of a couple will be taken into account. However, as the home child-care allowance will be merged into the parenting allowance, the person receiving the parenting allowance will retain an amount of $61 per fortnight irrespective of the partner's income&mdash;that is, where the recipient of the parenting allowance has nil income, income of the partner that is in excess of $763.43 per fortnight will reduce the rate of the allowance to $61. The $61 amount represents an estimated maximum rate that will apply in general because of indexation. That is the point that I mentioned originally. In relation to the parenting allowance itself, is it not a fact that both incomes are taken into account? Is that not splitting income? That is all I am asking the minister. </PARA>

The partner's income will start to affect the allowance of the other member of the couple only when the person stops receiving an allowance altogether. At the current rate this occurs when income reaches $466 a fortnight. In other words, the eligibility is assessed on the combined couple or family income, and the partner's income is not affected until all eligibility for payment is lost by the working partner.

We believe that it adds to this legislation the spirit that should prevail; that is, that the unemployed person who is described as `entering into an agreement' should be able to enter into that agreement from a position of reciprocal responsibility at the least. We believe it would be inappropriate to perpetuate the view, which we have already detected within some departments, that the case management activity agreement is a document that can be proposed by the case manager and presented to the subject of that agreement as a fait accompli. Such an attitude is unacceptable. I suggest that it is easy to see how departments would readily acquire a feeling of superiority and that the unemployed person would readily acquire a feeling of inferiority and inability to do anything other than accept what is offered. So in pursuing that, we can readily identify that Senator Margetts's suggested term of `negotiate' is much preferable.</PARA></TALK.START>

The words `enter into' and the terms that surround it are more than sufficient, in the government's mind, to allow that contract to be a fair and reasonable thing; whereas the word `negotiate' allows for the prospect of opting out decisions that may mean the contract is not entered into.

From that standpoint the young person is at a great disadvantage when facing up to a case manager with&mdash;I suggest, from some of the briefing material from the department&mdash;two weeks experience in handling the immense number of cases we are told they are capable of handling. Two weeks would be enough to overwhelm any of the individuals they are managing. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to keep in mind that with the privatisation of this side of the business, with the bonuses on placement and with the heavy number to be managed, we really are putting a great deal of weight on the side of the completion of a quick, sharp, efficient negotiation period&mdash;`Here you are, sonny Jim, sign this and get out of my way.'

But I am still concerned, especially when I look at clauses like clause 44&mdash;and we may talk about this again&mdash;that the case managers will be in a position of power and capable of railroading the unemployed into agreeing to almost anything. So it is the department's role to ensure that does not happen. While clause 39(6) requires the department to have regard to the person's needs before approving an agreement, that still does not adequately take into account whether the agreement has been properly negotiated. </PARA>

If the person has very poor communication skills or very low comprehension skills, then the department would be alerted by this section and would have a very close look at that particular agreement.

<PARA>This amendment really relates to the bill in the same way as did the first amendments which I attempted. It requires that, where a person proposes being involved in voluntary or community based work, the department must look at the benefit of that work to the community.

We should not be in a situation where the absolute desire of case managers to gain benefit for themselves should derogate from young people's opportunities to gain worthwhile experience and to contribute in a worthwhile manner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support the amendment either. I think Senator Troeth has concisely explained why this amendment is unnecessary. We believe that the amendment would be administratively onerous in that it imposes on the case manager the requirement to gauge the merit or benefit to the community of the proposed community based or artistic activity and then balance against the other elements of the job seeker's activity agreement to somehow achieve an equitable mix of obligations and activities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's firm view that the primary focus of any proposed activity, be it voluntary, community based or artistic work, should be its benefit to the job seeker in terms of equipping that person to effectively compete in the job market rather than some intangible benefit that the activity may provide to the community while the person continues on allowance. Again, I endorse the remarks of Senator Troeth. The government in no way undervalues the contribution of voluntary work to the community. But I think, in one sense, we are really comparing apples with pears in respect of the definition of `voluntary work' that is contained in the amendment. </PARA>

From my personal experience of some five years as a youth worker seeking to place people in employment, I found that the most successful precursor to employment is employment in any capacity and that those who are able to be gainfully occupied are those who are most readily employed for money at a future date.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>These amendments seek to recognise the benefit of voluntary community based and artistic work and its intrinsic value. They aim to ensure that, where a person proposes self-employment in the community sector, a slightly less onerous test is applied to approval of such a proposal. For a full commercial and self-employment proposal, the secretary must be satisfied that the venture will be commercially viable within 12 months. We suggest that if the proposal has a community element it will result in some benefit to the community and is likely to be commercially viable in 12 months. I think that is reasonable. </PARA>

Again, it is continuing in the same theme. If I seem less enthusiastic about it, it is because I do not like being hit on the head too many times.

This proposition was received with some degree of interest by the arts world knowing that budding young artists, starving in garrets somewhere&mdash;or wherever they starve&mdash;were likely to be assembling their first exhibition and unlikely to be able to interrupt themselves to comply with the activity test of the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that proposition has not been forwarded to the stage where it is working.

For many years, the Tasmanian champion weightlifter, Ron Laycock&mdash;I am sure you, Mr Temporary Chairman, recognise the name&mdash;was unsuccessful in obtaining continued employment in his home town of Campbelltown because it was not the metropolis which could provide the part-time work which would suit his training schedule.

<PARA>These amendments remove the six-month waiting period for people on an allowance to undertake activities relating to self-employment, group or cooperative enterprises and becoming self-sufficient in that. The Greens believe that these obstacles should not exist for unemployed people to enter into such flexible work arrangements. If we are to have a real understanding about the underlying causes of unemployment, and are now settling for structural unemployment as a nation, we must realise that there are limits to jobs out there. We must also do whatever we can to encourage unemployed people to create their own self-sustaining jobs and work activities, because the market will not be creating jobs for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add at this stage that we feel this is a very important concept. Many of the problems created that result in this level of unemployment for young people are not created at the local level; they are created at the national level and, perhaps even more importantly, at the international level. If people have been listening to the debate on GATT, they will appreciate my concerns about the implications for Australian employment and standards of living. I believe those implications will have to be considered as a result of ever increasing spirals of unemployment and indeed accepted levels of unemployment in our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the causes of unemployment are often at the national or international level, I believe people need to have the ability to find solutions at local level. If this series of legislation militates against young people seeking and finding solutions at the local level, then I am afraid that there is a lot about regional based development and local based development that the government just has not understood. I am afraid the people who will lose out in this bargain will be the young. So much are we concerned about this, that I give notice that we will be calling a division on these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in Sydney the winner of the Doug Moran National Portrait Prize was announced. I pay tribute not only to the artist, Josonia Palaitis, who is now $100,000 richer, but perhaps more importantly to the prize itself. The prize was initiated in 1988. It is a biannual prize initiated first as part of the bicentenary celebrations of that year. Since its inauguration it has had a major impact on the art world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prize was introduced, it is fair to say, at a time when portraiture, particularly in Australia, was languishing; when some of the major portrait prizes were considered by many to have gone somewhat off the rails. There was, for example, some dissatisfaction with some of the judging systems used&mdash;there was certainly some controversy&mdash;and it was felt that the winners were awarded on the basis of being fashionable and trendy rather than necessarily of the very best quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the prize was inaugurated in 1988 there has indeed been a noticeable change, which might be described as moving back towards mainline portraiture. The standard certainly has improved and, indeed, the importance of this particular prize has increased manyfold since its introduction. I think this is a reflection in many ways on the foresight of Doug and Greta Moran, who are the founders of the prize. I am sure that Doug will forgive me if I say that, although both of these two fine people have an interest in arts, Greta is the one who has the greater talent. She is about to open her own exhibition in the Parker Galleries in a day or two, she is an exhibiting member of the Royal Arts Society of New South Wales and is highly regarded and, indeed, has truly exceptional talents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The prize itself was really a family enterprise. It was a family working together that brought the prize into reality. It is reputedly the richest prize for portraiture in the world with the first prize being $100,000 and $1,000 going to each of the 30 finalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The popularity was indicated by the fact that this year there were almost 500 entries. Indeed, the overall standard was amazingly high. I viewed the second 30&mdash;those who did not achieve a final&mdash;and the standard in those 30 was incredibly high as well. Part of the attraction of the prize has been that the judging has been beyond criticism. It has been completely impartial. The selection of the 30 finalists this year, for example, was undertaken by two famous Australian art world characters: John MacPhee, who is the curator of the National Gallery of Victoria; and Ron Radford, who is the director of the Art Gallery of South Australia. These men are two of the most respected members of the Australian art community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the actual judges of the ultimate winner are a list of who's who from the art world worldwide. They include people such as Alan Fern, who is a director of the National Portrait Gallery in the Smithsonian Institute in Washington; Michael Noakes, a renowned portrait painter of the royal family in the UK; Professor Albinovich, the Lenin prize winner from the former USSR; Professor Bruno Foucart from the Sorbonne; and the last prize was judged by Felipe Lombard, who is a director of the world famous Prado museum in Madrid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the judge was Professor Nicola Spinosa, a very famous curator of art from Naples. One of the leading judges is the director of the Capo di Monte Gallery and is also the minister for art and culture in Naples. This impartiality in judging alone sets the prize apart. The fact that the prize also tours to a number of areas in New South Wales for almost two years creates enormous interest not only in the major capital cities but in many of the regional centres which it visits. It captures the imagination of artists from both professional and amateur ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doug and Greta and their family should be given great credit for making such a major impact on the art world. I think we should all be grateful for the impact this has made upon the standard of portraiture in Australia. It is a legacy to future generations. It does, of course, leave behind a representation of the changing face of Australia over the last six years but obviously in future years a longer term legacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Doug and Greta were also proponents of a national portrait gallery. This has now eventuated, perhaps not in the form which they envisaged but certainly their support was part of the whole process. The home of the art prize is the gallery in Murwillumbah, which Greta and Doug Moran and their family are in the process of reorganising, with the help of a former member of this parliament, Doug Anthony, who, as I understand it, donated the land where the new gallery will be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year the winner of the prize, who follows in a distinguished line of previous winners, has painted a portrait of John Mills. John Mills is a well-known Australian illustrator who died at the end of 1993 at the age of 86. The portrait was painted by his daughter Josonia Palaitis, who had her training in Sydney. She studied at the national art school. She was awarded a diploma of art in 1972 and, subsequently, a degree of art at the Sydney Art Institute. She has painted many portraits of famous people, including a member of this parliament, John Howard; John Dowd from the state parliament; Justice Michael Kirby; musicians Adrian Dangerfield and James Morrison; and one of the members of the press gallery in this place, Paul Lyneham. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The portrait is indeed a stunning work. I saw this when the portraits were being exhibited at the Old Parliament House a few weeks ago. It gives an insight into John Mills. Let me say simply that, although I never met John Mills, because of this portrait, I feel I know him. I feel that I have almost seen within his soul, and surely that is one of the tests of a great portrait. I offer my congratulations to Josonia, and I especially commend the whole of the Moran family for their hard work and devotion to this great enterprise. It is one which has enriched the art world&mdash;which has enriched the portrait art world, in particular&mdash;and which has benefited the whole of the Australian community around this great country of ours. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my making a few brief remarks about the book is that, in this period when Australians are becoming more and more conscious about history, it makes a special contribution to a greater understanding of Australian history, particularly as it relates to those terrible and tragic events of the First World War. The honorary publisher of the book is a Mr Allan Blankfield. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regimental Council of the Royal Victoria Regiment was determined to send a pilgrimage party to France, to commemorate, on Anzac Day this year 1993, the 75th Anniversary of the decisive Australian victory of the Battle of Villers-Bretonneux.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two 94 year old `Digger' veterans, thirty-four reservist soldiers and thirty-four other dedicated Australians participated in this self-funded trip to England and France, to witness the presentation of new Colours to the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, by His Royal Highness the Duke of Kent and to participate in the French commemorative celebrations.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the major contributors to the book was Mr Robin Corfield, who not only painstakingly researched and wrote most of the military history but also assisted in the presentation and coordination of this book. In one of the contributions that he makes he writes about those terrible events:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Coming such a short time after Federation and the establishment of the Commonwealth of Australia, this conflict marked the new nation deeply and permanently. Of the 330,000 Australians who volunteered and went abroad some 60,000 never returned. Of these 46,000 were lost in France and Flanders. Less than 30,000 of these have marked graves, the rest are names on the Memorials to the Missing. This was a loss that robbed Australia of more than she could afford.</PARA>
<PARA>Some 10,000 copies of the book have been printed and will be distributed to schools, particularly in Victoria, and to schools and other institutions in the Somme region of France. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One side of the book's pages is in English; the other side has a French translation. It is a wonderfully presented book. Not only does it convey an excellent feeling of the history of that period, but it also conveys very many interesting anecdotes about the soldiers, from the private to the general, who fought in that conflict and provides many fascinating facts about the battles that were fought, the uniforms that were worn and, perhaps in some ways, the private feelings of many of those soldiers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The text of the book is replete with wonderful photos, both tragic and heroic. It contains scenes and plans of the battles and, as I said, contains many quite fascinating facts about those events. One matter which came to my attention was the wonderful postcards that were sent home by the diggers of the First World War. It is interesting that on a number of those postcards the Australian flag was shown being very proudly waved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It occurred to me as I read through this book how little I knew about those events. I have always taken an interest in the history of this country but, if I reflect on the education that I received in my secondary schooling, I think very little was taught in schools in the 1960s about these events. I hope that that is not the case today. This sort of book will provide young students in our educational institutions, and perhaps many of the students of my period who went through schools in the 1950s and 1960s, with a better feeling for the history of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I commend this book to you and to honourable senators. I hope that the print run in the future will be more than 10,000 and that it will be possible for copies of this book to be distributed far and wide throughout this country. Because of the French theme in the book and the fact that much of the text is also translated into French, hopefully the book will be widely distributed in that country and, again, lead to closer contacts and understanding between Australia and France, particularly in that region of France where so many Australian soldiers served. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with pleasure that I bring this book to the attention of the Senate. I hope that many of my colleagues will have time to read it. I want to conclude by recalling one of the many fascinating anecdotes which appear in the book and quote an interesting story from Major General Elliott on the famous Australian slouch hat. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this war, in the beginning we were prepared to acquiesce silently in certain assumptions that were made as to our want of discipline and training. We even acquiesced again silently&mdash;though with grief&mdash;to the order that we should on the embarkation to Gallipoli discard our Australian hats in favour of the round caps of the British Infantry, for it was said "the Turks will know from your hats that you are irregular Australian Troops, and will therefore fight harder than if they thought they were confronted by the men of the British army."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We lived to hear it seriously proposed by a British officer, high on the general staff that, "Australian hats should be issued to a large proportion of the British army in France, so that the enemy might be stricken by the thought that they had Australian troops along a large portion of his front."</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4031" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In addition to the Auditor-General's review, the EMDG Scheme has also recently been subject to a thorough evaluation of its effectiveness. The result of this evaluation was the report `Helping to Meet the Export Challenge' which was released on 27 July 1994. A copy has been sent to Senator Knowles.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is perhaps the most extensive evaluation of the EMDG Scheme to date and sets new standards in demonstrating the effectiveness of Government programs. Much of the research was undertaken by independent consultants from the Economic Studies and Strategies Unit of Price Waterhouse, and by Professor Bewley, Head of the School of Economics and Professor of Econometrics at the University of New South Wales. Professor Bewley demonstrated, beyond doubt, the additional results this scheme is achieving in encouraging and realising exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The research concluded, among other things, that the EMDG Scheme has directly encouraged firms to increase their spending on export marketing promotion in anticipation of receipt of a grant, resulting in more exports. In the case of mature exporters, the EMDG Scheme has generated increased exports in the order of 15-25 times the value of these marketing expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing number of firms claiming under the EMDG Scheme. In the 1991/92 claim year 2,473 exporters who claimed under the program generated exports of $3.6 billion. The following year, 1992/93, 3,251 claimants had export sales of $5.2 billion. It is estimated that around 3,700 exporters will lodge claims for expenditure incurred last financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Austrade has largely agreed with the view expressed by the Auditor-General that improvements could be made to the performance expectations and measures for the EMDG Scheme. Austrade and the ANAO note that the Scheme has many interest groups with varying expectations of its purpose and performance. Clearly these groups, and the Scheme, would benefit from greater focus of the performance measures.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall performance of the Scheme is addressed comprehensively by the Evaluation mentioned above by Price Waterhouse and Professor Ron Bewley. Austrade advises that it anticipates the performance measures used in this report will continue to be publicly reported periodically. The ANAO did not have time to fully consider this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improvements in other management areas are currently being implemented. However, given the number and scope of recommendations made by the Auditor-General concerning data collection and suggested performance indicators, Austrade indicated in its responses to the ANAO recommendations that it would employ an expert consultant in this field to assist in the development of key performance indicators. This process is currently under way and will be complete in February or March 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Austrade regards accountability to Parliament as fundamental to its operation and considers that this process raises the confidence of the business sector generally in the Scheme. As Austrade pointed out in the Auditor-General's report, the EMDG Scheme has been the subject of twelve reviews and reports in the last ten years, all of which are public documents. Austrade's experience is that individual exporters regard each examination of EMDG as reducing the certainty of the Scheme and consequently affects their confidence to increase export marketing and promotional activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade is concerned to ensure that it effectively meets Parliament's need for information but that major evaluation and review is carried out at reasonable intervals. This will ensure that potential claimants can confidently plan additional export promotion activity on the expectation of receiving assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade operates under strict principles of commercial confidentiality which are regulated by Section 94 of the Australian Trade Commission Act 1985. Under that section, Austrade is barred from releasing information held on individual claimants' other than their name and the amount of the grant paid.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade is concerned that the process of reporting to Parliament not result in the release of either commercial-in-confidence information on claimants which would contravene this section or information that may jeopardise individual claimants' entitlements to EMDG assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade expects that a sensible approach to Parliamentary reporting with realistic expectations from stakeholders and a commitment to the commercial integrity of the Scheme will retain the confidence of the Parliament, exporters and potential applicants to the Scheme.</PARA>
