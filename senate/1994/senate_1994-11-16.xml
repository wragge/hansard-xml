<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the government has announced that the sale of the Commonwealth's remaining 75 per cent equity in Qantas Airways Ltd will take place in the first half of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Qantas Sale Act 1992, which established the legislative and administrative framework for the sale, received royal assent on 21 December 1992 and was subsequently amended in 1993 to extend the date of automatic repeal of any unproclaimed portions of the act until 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then, there has been a number of developments which require the government's attention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Stock Exchange's new electronic share transfer system, the Clearing House Electronic Subregister System (CHESS), became operational in September 1994. As a condition of listing on the Stock Exchange, Qantas will be required to be eligible to participate in CHESS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sale Act imposes a limit of 35 per cent on the level of foreign ownership and currently provides that Qantas' articles of association must contain certain provisions enforcing that requirement. In particular, the act confers on directors the power to refuse to register a transfer of shares which could result in the foreign ownership limit being breached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because these powers are inconsistent with the CHESS rules which facilitate unrestricted electronic transfer and settlement in shares, it is proposed that the act no longer require the articles to impose restrictions on the transfer of shares to give effect to the foreign ownership limit. There are currently share disenfranchisement and divestment provisions in Qantas' articles which will continue to fulfil the legislative requirement that Qantas monitor and enforce the foreign ownership restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sale Act contains a number of provisions dealing with employee entitlements. Minor amendments will be made to the long service leave provisions to bring them into line with those in other asset sale legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sale Act effectively imposes a deadline of 30 June 1995 for completion of the public share offer, as any provisions of the act which have not commenced by this date would lapse. The government has not yet settled on a date for the public share offer but wishes to leave open the option of conducting it after the conclusion of the May budget. In that event, the sale timetable will be very tight and it may prove difficult to complete all necessary administrative arrangements by 30 June. To ensure that the government has sufficient flexibility with regard to all its options, the bill provides that the legislative sunset clause be extended by two months to 31 August 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Air Navigation Act 1920 imposes controls over foreign shareholdings in Australian international airlines. Because Qantas is subject to its own controls under the Sale Act, it was not intended that the Air Navigation Act measures should also apply to Qantas. However, as the wording of the Air Navigation Act is ambiguous, it will be amended to confirm that this measure does not apply to Qantas.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 30 September 1993 the Senate referred the matter of the validation of care aggregated module and standard aggregated module funding of nursing homes to the committee. The committee tabled a preliminary report on 25 November 1993. In this report the committee decided to maintain a watching brief in relation to the reference and report to the Senate accordingly. The committee presented two further reports to the Senate&mdash;a short report on 24 March 1994 and a progress report on 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's final report tabled today concentrates on two main issues, namely, the process of validation and issues relating to the boundaries of CAM-SAM services. The committee notes that the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian National Audit Office are also undertaking inquiries on validation and several studies have considered options for reform in the nursing home area in recent years. The committee understands that the audit office's report on aspects of validation will be released in December 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee's inquiry, concerns were expressed by nursing home industry organisations and a number of individual nursing homes at a number of features of the validation process, including the timeliness of validations, the consistency of decision making by validators and the impact of validations on the continued financial viability of nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of particular concern to many in the industry were the delays in the validation process, that is, the period of time between a cost being incurred and validation of that cost. The committee received considerable comment about the often long delays in validating 1986-87 data. The committee notes that the department did not finalise validation of this data until June 1994. Concerns were also raised over the effect that this delay had on the finances of many nursing homes. In respect of the validation of 1986-87 data, the committee concluded that the department performed very poorly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that these validations should have been completed by the department over a much shorter time frame than in fact occurred. The committee considers that the department should have recognised the need for additional resources to be devoted to the validation exercise and should have responded in a more timely manner. The department is now faced with the task of validating a large number of outstanding payments to nursing homes that must be completed within three years. The committee is concerned at the level of outstanding validations and the capacity of the department to fulfil the legislative requirement to complete validations of post-1 July 1993 benefits within three years. The committee has recommended that the Department of Human Services and Health provide a detailed schedule to the committee outlining its proposed program for completing these outstanding validations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also looked at the impact of negative loadings or recoveries by the department of any overpayments on the financial viability of nursing homes and concluded that, at least in the short term, these loadings may have some adverse impact on the financial viability of some homes. The evidence suggested that validation loadings are not solely responsible for nursing home bankruptcies, with other factors, including the financial management practices of some nursing home proprietors, playing a role in these bankruptcies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also addressed the need for reform in the overall funding arrangements for nursing homes. The committee concluded that the funding system could be substantially improved by moving the border between acquittable and non-acquittable funding from the current CAM-SAM boundary. The committee considers that the introduction of this system of funding would facilitate greater staff flexibility in nursing homes while still retaining proper standards of care for nursing home residents. The committee is of the view that more fundamental change to the current funding system is required than a mere `clarification' by the department of CAM-SAM boundary issues, and therefore considers that the government should introduce a system broadly based on option 2 of the Gregory report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Structure of Nursing Home Funding Arrangements: Stage 1</EMPHASIS>. This proposal would involve a system of acquitting labour costs and providing a non-acquittable grant for non-labour costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also made a number of other important recommendations to improve the overall effectiveness of the validation program. The committee found that there had been cases of inconsistencies in decisions made by validation teams in different states. Where inconsistencies in decisions have been made, the committee believes that the department should take appropriate steps to address the problem, especially through its training program for validators. The committee also considers that validators should be required to have accountancy qualifications or other appropriate training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the committee also concluded that consistency could be facilitated through better communication with the industry in relation to departmental policy. The committee recommended that the department should make available to the industry a document that would provide guidance to the industry on the validation process and that this document should form the basis for validations for the year in which it is issued. The committee also believes that the document should be widely disseminated throughout the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concluded that there should be better dissemination of information generally about the program by the department, to both proprietors and directors of nursing. The committee also believes that there needs to be improved consultation with the industry, especially in the formulation of departmental circulars, which are an important means of advising the industry of administrative or policy changes concerning the program. The committee, in particular, recommended that the department issue the NH20 form, which is required to be completed annually by nursing home proprietors and is the form by which proprietors account for their use of nursing and personal care funding, prior to the start of each financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the recommendations that it has made will substantially improve the validation process and make the process more transparent and accountable. In particular, it considers that the reforms that it has proposed in the area of nursing home funding arrangements will address many of the concerns of the industry expressed during the inquiry while maintaining the high standards of care for nursing home residents. Finally, the committee wishes to thank those individuals and organisations who made submissions and gave evidence at public hearings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As one of the committee members responsible for this report, I would like to draw to the attention of the house the fact that there is a dissenting report and that four of us disagreed specifically with the recommendation in relation to favouring Gregory option No. 2. Those of us who did so were concerned about the impact that option No. 2 potentially has on the standards of care in nursing homes. Before I get to that, on the issue of consistency and inconsistency it is important to note that in paragraph 3.5 of the report we say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ombudsman advised the Committee that its investigations have not indicated `serious inconsistency' in the decisions made in different States. The Ombudsman noted that some inconsistencies may occur because there are differences in the nursing home industry in the various States.</PARA>
<PARA>I think, given the changes that have taken place in the legislation in the Victorian area in the last week or so, we are likely to see even greater differences within the industry between states. We looked at Gregory options Nos. 2 and 3 very seriously. It is worth noting what was said in the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Gregory report noted that under Option 2B there was a potential for some reduction in the standards of resident care. It was noted that, as in Option 2A, a proprietor would have the opportunity to divert funds provided for nursing and personal care staff to employ more administrative staff. Under this option, there is no financial incentive for efficiency in most areas where the proprietor has any control. The effect would be that the funding provided for care could be `effectively eroded', leading to reduced care, unless the Government provided additional funding.(152) The report also noted that because of this, more reliance would need to be placed on the standards monitoring system to ensure quality of care, that is, more intensive standards monitoring overall would be required.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, would require extra government expenditure. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are limitations to the extent to which standards monitoring can perform this function. The Gregory report noted that the standards monitoring program was designed in the expectation that nursing and personal care funding would be acquitted&mdash;`it was not designed to give emphasis to quality of nursing practice or adequacy of nursing coverage. It was designed to give most emphasis to the areas in which nursing homes were most deficient . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that if we blur the boundaries under CAM, the care aggregated module, which includes nursing care and personal care, and the boundaries under SAM, the standard aggregated module, which talks about the uniform amount that is required each day for a resident to meet the costs of food, electricity and building maintenance, we will make it more difficult for the monitoring of standards. We will require more in-depth standards monitoring. We will require more people to be involved in the process to see that this actually happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the provision of aged care&mdash;care to the frail aged, disabled and the elderly&mdash;the most important thing, the paramount thing, is the standard of care. I for one could not be party to any recommendation that runs the risk of having an impact upon the standard of care in nursing homes. Those of us who have been around the industry for many years would remember what the standard of care in nursing homes was like 20 years ago. It was appalling. It left more than a lot to be desired. The treatment was not good. I would have to say that some in my profession of nursing did not fulfil their duties correctly. We have seen a magnificent change in that, and the standard is now very high. It is one about which we can be proud. But I am not prepared to be part of anything that runs the risk of reducing that standard of care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to touch on the likely impacts on the nursing home industry of the Health Act (Amendment) Bill 1994, which was enacted last week in Victoria. This bill has effectively removed all safeguards which protect the quality of care of elderly residents in nursing homes. What the legislation is reported to be doing is removing the regulation that requires qualified nurses to be employed in nursing homes. It also, I understand, removes current statutory requirements including residents' rights to high quality health care, residents' rights to choose their own doctor, residents' rights to be treated with dignity and respect, and residents' rights to sufficient levels of nutrition, clothing and shelter. These are all issues relating to the standard of care that is given in nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the legislation will allow any facility to advertise as a nursing home, remove the requirement for nursing homes to be registered in Victoria and remove the provision of confidentiality of residents' records. When we tie those changes to the relaxation of the CAM-SAM boundaries, the potential for the reduction in care that is provided to the residents I think is quite significant. To me, it is a reduction that is not tenable and not one that we should be accepting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recommend that people read very carefully the dissenting report that was signed by four members of the committee. We should be very careful to ensure that anything that is done in the area of nursing home care&mdash;the provision of care and assistance to the frail, elderly and disabled&mdash;does not at any stage reduce the standards of care to the people who are living in those institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The background to this report from the Community Affairs References Committee is the difficulties faced by the nursing home industry in regard to the CAM-SAM boundary. The CAM&mdash;the care aggregated module&mdash;basically refers to nursing and therapy staff wages relating to nursing care and personal care; whilst SAM provides a non-acquittable uniform amount to meet things such as salaries of staff who are not involved directly in personal care, and other things such as electricity. There is also OCRE, which is not particularly relevant to the current report. That deals with cost reimbursement for superannuation and such like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem has been that with the current system the non-acquittable SAM and the acquittable CAM systems mean that if SAM costs can be passed onto CAM there are more profits to the proprietor. Therefore, of course, there are boundaries between CAM and SAM at present which clearly need to be defined to make it possible for a nursing home operator to organise the staff appropriately. If the boundaries are going to be defined, they have to be defined in such a way that the people operating nursing homes can understand them; indeed, in such a way that they are actually communicating to the nursing home proprietors. It is clear that that was not done in a way which was satisfactory and appropriate to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the boundaries were not clearly defined, how could people running nursing homes comply with boundaries that they could not see? There are a number of problems here, but I will come back to that point because it is of relevance to the issue that Senator West has just raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch upon the question of timeliness because the validation for 1986-87 was not even started until 1990-91 and was not complete at the time this reference was made to the committee. The committee's conclusion that in this regard the department performed very poorly is entirely justified. There were no manuals to aid the nursing homes in terms of the validation procedure. Essentially, they had very little idea of how the validation procedures were going to work when they first started. They mainly gained their knowledge by word of mouth from other nursing home operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that a manual should be available to encourage and to allow people to meet the requirements of the validation process. This will simplify the validation process, and therefore make it less costly to the taxpayer. One of the committee's recommendations is that we should make sure that a manual is available&mdash;with confidential information removed, of course. On that basis, when the validation has been carried out the government can then apply negative loadings to nursing homes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of interest that some 75  per cent of nursing homes validated had negative loadings applied to them. It is pretty difficult to accept that 75 per cent of nursing homes are crooked in some way. The only sensible conclusion to draw is that the bureaucracy involved, the lack of definition, the lack of clarification, and the lack of information and communication passed on to the nursing home proprietors were in large part responsible for the fact that 75 per cent of nursing homes did not meet the validation standards. The fact that they were not aware of the validation standards underpins the whole problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were inconsistencies between states and between teams. It is not clear to the committee exactly how significant those inconsistencies were. Part of those inconsistencies could have been due to the different ways of operating nursing homes in different states and the different regulations involved. But it seemed that there were inconsistencies which could have been diminished, if not removed, by more appropriate training and by enrolling validators with better and higher qualifications. That is a recommendation of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis on which information is required by the department is a form called NH20. One would think that if one was going to ask the nursing home for information one would tell the nursing home in advance what information it should have. The department's manner in this regard was to say, `No, we will actually tell you what information we want to collect six months after the end of the year in which you are collecting it.' Clearly, by anybody's standards, that was unacceptable. A very strong recommendation of the committee was that the NH20 form should be available to nursing homes in advance of the year for which it was to be applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the problem with validation, some nursing homes with negative loadings were sold to owners who were unable to ascertain whether in fact there was a negative loading involved. That problem has been dealt with in respect of nursing homes being sold now, but there was a period when there was no way in which the new purchaser of the nursing home could be aware of the problems facing that nursing home. That was clearly unacceptable. The ombudsman has suggested, and the committee agrees with the suggestion, that appropriate compensation should be considered, according to the merits of the individual cases in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come to one of the main issues, which is this CAM-SAM boundary. The first thing we have to say is that the boundaries are artificial; they are not related to care, as such. For example, bed making is part of personal care, but food serving may or may not be part of personal care. There is a very rigid boundary between what may be CAM or what may be SAM, for example, in regard to food serving. In a particular nursing home, an individual might take the food from the kitchenette into the dining room. At this stage, that is a SAM duty. As soon as that person gets into the dining room, it becomes a CAM duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the person doing that particular procedure has at some stage to turn around and say, `I am no longer SAM; I am now CAM.' That sort of nonsense is bad enough in a large nursing home, but for a small nursing home, where the staff are essentially multiskilled, it makes a nonsense and a mockery of the whole situation. It is not possible to define those sorts of procedures adequately and in a way which is sensible and which does not involve the proprietors in undue and inappropriate bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation of the committee, therefore, is that we adopt in broad terms the recommendation from the government's own report&mdash;the Gregory report&mdash;option two. Option two essentially abolishes the CAM-SAM boundary, saying that, directly or indirectly, most of the work done in the nursing home, except for some essential administration tasks, is related to the care of the patient. Gregory option two recommends that the labour costs be acquitted in general and some minor exceptions made to that, and other expenses are left in a separate category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: does this affect care? That is something which Senator West and I share a view on. We would not support any changes which in any way threaten to reduce the quality of care offered to residents in nursing homes. We believe there is no reason whatsoever why there should be any reduction in care. The most important maintainer of care in nursing homes is the standard monitoring teams assessments. The standard monitoring teams assess a number of criteria and make a report on those issues. It is a very effective way of maintaining standards in nursing homes, which, Senator West quite rightly points out, have improved enormously over the 20 years. To suggest that we would be going back 20 years, as Senator West implied, by making a change to CAM-SAM is a nonsense. It is not relevant. Nobody is suggesting going back to the old-fashioned system that we had 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying, however, is that simply by removing an artificial boundary as to what may or may not be personal care&mdash;a boundary determined by bureaucrats and not really relevant to the actual care given to the patients&mdash;we will make sure that the bureaucracy is removed and there are enormous savings in validations. It was mentioned by Senator West that there would be extra costs in expanding standard monitoring teams, but she forgot to mention that there will be significant savings by reducing the size and the work of the  validation teams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this way, we can introduce flexibility into nursing homes. This is vital for proprietors to be able to organise their staff appropriately, according to the individual work place and according to whether the nursing home is large or small, or has particular issues in regard to the types of residents it has. It is absolutely crucial that we allow this to proceed. We believe this will enhance the level of care offered; it will enhance the efficiency of the nursing homes; it will reduce the bureaucracy which they have to face; and in the end it will improve the standard of care given to residents in those nursing homes, which is of vital importance to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the Gregory report got it right in this regard. I might mention in passing that there is a strong body of view that the Gregory report also got some other things right&mdash;such as ensuring that there is an appropriate remuneration on a per capita basis. I certainly hope that the government will follow the recommendations of the Gregory report and introduce the increase in funding which that report recommended as a way of ensuring that the quality of care, which is already excellent, is maintained over the next few years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I regret that it was not a majority report, that we did have a dissenting report on one issue. In the main, as I closely watched that committee because I was not on it&mdash;although I moved the motion, I was not on the committee until the very end&mdash;I believe that it was a very cooperative committee which came up with a lot of reasonable and appropriate recommendations in its report. I would ask the government and the department to look very closely at it to ensure that, as far as possible, those recommendations are followed because, really, the main game and the main aim is to ensure that frail, older people in Australia are cared for to the best of our corporate ability&mdash;that is, the ability of the government, the coalition, this parliament, the department and those people working in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very complex to ensure that the funding is used appropriately and not misappropriated. We all understand that, and none of us would condone any nursing home or nursing home proprietor who misappropriates taxpayers' money which is legitimately directed towards the care of the frail and elderly in our community. However, we have to ensure that bureaucratic regulations, the shifting of goal posts and the untimeliness of carrying out validations does not interfere with the care of those older people. That is the balance we have to achieve to ensure that that money is spent appropriately and that accountability for that money does not mean that we impinge on or take away from the care of older people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Constantly, as one moves around nursing homes, one hears&mdash;and I visit nursing homes with great frequency, two and three in a non-sitting week&mdash;the concern of proprietors about the time that is taken away from caring for their residents and the time that they have to give to filling out papers to comply with rules, regulations, inspections and whatever else might go on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that many things are necessary to ensure accountability but we have to make sure that the balance is right. Some of the demands that are made on nursing homes are much more stringent than those made by the Australian Taxation Office in assessing whether we, as a community, have claims that are tax deductible. This is actually the same thing&mdash;the tax office is trying to appropriately assess tax deductible items. In the same way, the department is trying to ensure that nursing homes spend money on the things on which they say they have spent it, whether it be nursing care, kitchen staff or cleaning staff&mdash;and that balance has to be achieved.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said, it must be achieved in a way that ensures that we focus on allowing most of the time of the staff to be given to residents rather than to meeting bureaucratic procedures. </PARA>

I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the reports.</PARA>
<PARA>The first report which I have tabled involves recommendation for the development of the 2nd Field Hospital at Enoggera, Queensland at an estimated cost of $29.2 million. This hospital will replace present inadequate facilities at 1st Military Hospital at Yeronga, 2nd Field Hospital at Kelvin Grove and the Enoggera Medical Centre. When inspecting the current facilities the committee was impressed by the dedication of the staff at Yeronga and Kelvin Grove. These personnel are presently working in old timber, metal and asbestos-clad buildings which provide inadequate working conditions and lead to operational inefficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A need therefore exists to replace these substandard facilities with a modern hospital capable of providing medical and dental services for personnel of the Australian Defence Force. This will be achieved by building a modern purpose-built hospital at Enoggera. The new facilities will include accommodation for an operational army hospital with a 50-bed capacity. The proposal will also include the provision of logistic, administrative, training and living-in accommodation. The proposed hospital will be in close proximity to the units which it will support, as well as being in a location convenient for visiting civilian medical specialists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second report which I have tabled recommends construction of a housing development at Bligh Park, New South Wales, for defence personnel at an estimated cost of $8.5m. Some 450 service families are presently living in substandard accommodation in the Richmond-Windsor area&mdash;the majority being at Hobartville. The Defence Housing Authority proposes to provide suitable accommodation for some of these families by acquiring between 50 and 65 housing lots in a new stage of a residential subdivision&mdash;Precinct 29 at Bligh Park, New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bligh Park Estate will eventually comprise about 2,225 dwellings. The Defence Housing Authority currently has 92 properties on the estate for service families. DHA intends to acquire these additional residential allotments and construct houses on them in a planned extension to the estate. The site is well located for housing for service families because of its proximity to RAAF Base Richmond and existing and proposed schools, shopping and recreational facilities which have been established over the past 10 years. The proposal will provide defence personnel and their families with good quality housing and services consistent with community standards. I commend the reports to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the third report which the committee has presented during this parliament. Honourable senators will recall that in June 1994 I presented a report on women's representation in parliament, and an interim report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial reporting by political parties</EMPHASIS> concerning election funding and disclosure. The government has acted on our recommendations and has introduced legislation which is currently before the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has now reported on each election conducted by the Australian Electoral Commission since the AEC's establishment in 1984. This process has proved to be an effective means of informing the government and the AEC of the perceived need for legislative or administrative change to the electoral system based on the evidence of electors,  parliamentarians, political parties and informed observers of the political scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, this report records the findings of the committee on the criticisms and proposals for change that have been submitted to the inquiry based on the experience of the 1993 federal election. The report recommends refinements to many areas of the electoral system. Most of these proposals have the support of the whole committee. However, there are differences of opinion on some matters of policy. In these cases members have elected to exercise their right to add dissent to the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is able to make a positive report on the operation of the electoral system and its administration by the AEC. The AEC provided an improved level of service at the 1993 election at a lower cost in real terms to that in 1990. The use of revised polling place strategies and the adoption for the House of Representatives scrutiny of the two candidate preferred count virtually eliminated problems experienced at the 1990 election with queuing at polling places and slow results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result of the House of Representatives election was predicted at a very early stage on election night. In our report, we have recommended further improvements to the conduct of the two candidate preferred count. For the Senate scrutiny, we have recommended that the Commonwealth Electoral Act be amended to allow known preferences on the group voting tickets to be taken into consideration. This should speed up the final determination of Senate results considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A contentious issue examined during the inquiry was the potential for electoral fraud. Having examined the evidence, a majority of the committee agrees with the AEC that fraud was not a significant occurrence during the last election and did not influence any result. Therefore, we do not consider that changes to procedures intended to reduce the opportunity for fraud&mdash;such as requiring proof of identity and closing electoral rolls as soon as an election is called&mdash;are required. We believe that electoral integrity requires that electors be given every opportunity to exercise their franchise, and we support absolutely the AEC's policy of encouraging maximum possible participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee, however, agreed that the integrity of the electoral rolls is of central importance to the functioning and acceptability of the electoral outcome. We would like to see a move away from the present arrangements which rely on a blitz on enrolments through habitation review just prior to an election. A better system would be one based on continuous roll review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the committee's recommendations are designed to increase participation by electors in rural and remote communities, including Aboriginal communities. For example, we recommend improvements to the process for removing names from the electoral rolls following objection action, and we recommend that interstate absent voting be allowed in electoral divisions bordering state boundaries. Also, some postal voters in remote areas are regularly disenfranchised because infrequent mail delivery means they cannot return their ballot papers in the time allowed by postal voting. We, therefore, recommend that general postal voters living more than 100 kilometres from a polling booth be allowed to receive ballot papers as soon as the election is called without having to first fill in and return a postal vote application form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges the importance of electoral education. We recommend a public education campaign to improve electors' understanding of how preferential voting works. Submissions were made to the committee recommending the insertion of so-called `truth in advertising' provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Government members of the committee continue to believe that such legislation would be unenforceable and ineffective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the committee rejects calls for the use of how-to-vote cards to be banned. However, we have recommended that the AEC investigate means of displaying how-to-vote information inside polling booths, as is done for some state elections. The committee has recommended that the minimum election period be reduced from 33 to 28 days, a reform that will undoubtedly be welcomed by the public and will potentially lead to a reduction in the overall cost of elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lastly, the committee recommends that prisoners under sentence for an offence punishable by five years or more imprisonment no longer be deprived of the vote. A majority of the committee believes that this reform, if enacted, will serve the aim of rehabilitating prisoners by encouraging them to observe one of their most important civil obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank my fellow committee members for their support during the inquiry. I believe our endeavours will result in a system for the next federal election even more efficient and inclusive than that used so successfully in 1993. I thank the committee secretary, Mr Donald Nairn; the research officer, Mr Russel Chafer; the administrative assistant, Mrs Helen Fyfe; and other staff who served the committee during the course of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank all those people who made submissions to the inquiry and appeared as witnesses, in particular, the officers of the Australian Electoral Commission. We particularly thank Mr Brian Cox, who has recently announced his retirement, for his distinguished service as the Commonwealth's most senior electoral officer and for the support he has given to the committee during his period in office.

After all, we are talking about a review of an election held 20 months ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members of this committee agreed with the government on many of the issues identified in the report. The report proposes many sensible changes which we hope the government will accept. However, the coalition members have prepared a minority report for presentation to the parliament because we believe that, on several critical issues, the Labor Party and the Labor members of the committee have turned a blind eye to many of the problems in the electoral system that are evident to us and which this government is choosing to ignore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are most concerned about the integrity of the electoral system. The fact that more submissions were received on this issue than any other and have aroused a lot of controversy and problems in the hearings makes it clear that there is a growing lack of confidence in the Australian electorate with the integrity of the electoral system. Our argument is that the electoral system is wide open to abuse and potential fraud. It is not a question of whether the system is being abused but whether it is open to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that there is no real evidence of abuse. One of the problems is that it is so open that it is extremely difficult to prove whether it is being abused. Our argument is that the Electoral Commission is incapable of satisfying us that it is not being abused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are extremely concerned over how easy it is to enrol. All that is required of people is that they roll up with a card signed by another elector and they are on the roll. It is also extremely easy to vote&mdash;so easy that, if people wish to do so by fraudulent means, there is virtually nothing in the system to prevent them from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is clearly a problem with multiple voting. According to the commission's figures, there were 6,000 cases of multiple voting completely unaccounted for and unexplained. Since the government won the last federal election only by about 12,000 or 13,000 votes, 6,000 cases of multiple voting is an extremely serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also problems in relation to people voting in false names&mdash;there is no way of telling whether that is going on&mdash;and with people being able to enrol when they are not eligible to enrol. No-one can prove that that is not occurring either. The government members are simply not prepared to do anything about this system, presumably because they believe that having a system wide open to abuse suits their electoral purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their minority report, the coalition members have proposed a number of measures to counter problems in a system that, we believe, is losing respect within the Australian electorate and is open to abuse. We have called for a system requiring proof of identity for enrolment. To most Australians it is unbelievable that there is no system of requiring proof of identity for enrolment. People have to prove who they are for almost everything else in society, so for one of the most important things&mdash;the right to vote&mdash;people should have to prove who they are for everybody else to have confidence in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the Electoral Commission should be asked to trial a system of voter cards&mdash;that is, when people go to vote they have to hand over a voter card. That has been trialled in the state of Victoria and, according to reports we have received, works extremely well. It is used in many other jurisdictions and should at least be trialled in Australia for potential implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least the government has made one concession&mdash;and we agree with it&mdash;that there should be continuous roll reviews. These one-off, haphazard, ad hoc roll reviews done in the run-up to elections are simply not good enough. They should be continuous. We are pleased to see that the government members have proposed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that to minimise the extent to which there may be multiple voting, subdivisional voting should be reintroduced. It is quite extraordinary that people can vote at any booth in an electorate on election day. We think that subdivisional voting should be reintroduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant proposal, in my view, made by the coalition members is the proposal in this report, in the context of the integrity of the electoral system, to abolish compulsory voting. As the Senate knows, I am something of an advocate of non-compulsory voting for a whole range of reasons, both philosophical and practical. But it was readily apparent to the coalition members of this committee that our system of compulsory voting is one of the most significant contributors to the maintenance of an electoral system wide open to abuse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government members and the Electoral Commission both argue that, because we force citizens to enrol and vote, we must make it as easy as possible for them to enrol and to ultimately vote. The two are intrinsically linked. There is an umbilical cord between compulsory voting and the system which, in our view, is wide open to abuse and which has lost the confidence of the Australian people. For that reason alone, compulsory voting should be ended. It should also be ended for all the other reasons which I have long expounded on. It is undemocratic, it should end, and I am delighted that my coalition colleagues on this committee have joined me in calling for an end to compulsory voting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report of the coalition members also strongly opposes the government members' recommendation that all prisoners be allowed to vote. I think the government members might rue the day that they ever proposed something like this. I think the government, in its wisdom, will reject this proposition that all prisoners should now be able to retain the right to vote. That will be offensive to the great majority of Australians, who believe that, if people commit an offence, they should be denied certain basic freedoms. One of those is the right to vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current law provides that, if someone has been convicted of an offence punishable by a term of five years imprisonment, he or she is denied the right to vote. We understand there are difficulties with that, and perhaps the law should just provide that, if a person has been sentenced to a term of, let us say, three, four or five years, that person is denied the right to vote. But to solve the problem by tossing out the baby with the bath water, as the government members suggest, is absolutely ridiculous and, I think, offensive to most Australians, who believe that law and order is a major problem and to make this great concession to prisoners to give them back a right to vote is completely wrong. I urge the government to reject that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also oppose the quite blatantly cynical proposition by the government members that the length of an election campaign should be reduced from 33 days to 28 days. The Electoral Commission itself has great reservations about that proposition. It is clearly designed to suit an incumbent government. That is why the government has proposed it. It is simply not practical to have a federal election campaign run from start to finish in 28 days. Thirty-three days causes great difficulties for parties and the Electoral Commission. Twenty-eight days would be quite untenable, and again we urge the government to reject it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members have also called for prohibition of misleading and untrue advertising. We believe that the provision on this that was in the act in 1984 should be reinstituted. We are brought to that conclusion by the campaign which the ALP conducted in 1993, when it broke all the conventions in relation to political advertising and used its trade union resources to run election advertisements which blatantly lied about coalition policy. We have a provision like this in the South Australian electoral act. It works; it works well. It does restrict the extent to which blatantly untrue political advertising occurs. It is unbelievable that a government which actually tried to ban political advertising now will have no part of regulating the extent to which untrue advertising is put to air. I am glad the Democrats have joined with us in calling for a prohibition of misleading and untrue advertising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also, in the spirit of free speech, called for repeal of the provision in the act which makes it an offence to advocate informal voting. This government's record in relation to free speech is abominable, as we have seen in the racial vilification bill, and the existence of this particular provision, which means that people commit an offence if they say to someone that they should vote informally, is quite offensive and should go. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SOCIAL SECURITY (PARENTING ALLOWANCE AND OTHER MEASURES)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill continues the major reform of Australia's income support system for unemployed people arising from the Government's White Paper, Working Nation. The measures provide increased incentives under the income test for unemployed people to take up low paid work. They also include the introduction of parenting allowance. The Bill also continues the strategy of phasing out payments based on a dependent relationship between people in the social security system, with individuals needing to establish a personal entitlement to a social security payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1995 there will be an important new non-activity tested, independent payment for families. This new payment, to be known as parenting allowance, will be available to the partners of income support recipients who have dependent children under 16. It will also be available to the partners of low income earners, and to partners who have low personal income, who have dependent children under 16. It will incorporate, and go beyond, the home child care allowance currently being paid to Australian families. It will, however, preserve the major elements of the home child care allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum rate of parenting allowance will be the same as the rate paid to each member of a pensioner or allowance couple (currently $268.20 a fortnight). Generally, parenting allowance will be income and assets tested. Income of both members of a couple will be taken into account. However, as home child care allowance will be merged into parenting allowance, an amount of parenting allowance of up to $61 a fortnight (a basic parenting allowance component) will be available regardless of income received by the recipient's partner. The amount of up to $61 represents an estimated maximum rate of the home child care allowance that will apply from 1 January 1995. This amount may be reduced only by personal income of a parenting allowance recipient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the maximum parenting allowance rate ($268.20 a fortnight) and the maximum rate of basic component ($61 a fortnight) will be indexed twice a year in March and September. Although parenting allowance will generally be taxable, any amount paid up to $61 a fortnight will be free of tax. Generally, only people receiving parenting allowance at a higher rate than the $61 basic parenting allowance component will automatically be entitled to additional family payment and health care card concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parenting allowance has been carefully designed to improve full-time work incentives for unemployed couples with children. It will also make sure that low income couples with children will continue to be financially better off with one partner in full-time work rather than both being on income support. A further feature of the new allowance is that low income families will have a greater degree of choice about whether one partner will stay at home and care for their children, a choice generally available up to now only to those on higher incomes.   At the same time, the entitlement of most higher income families to the basic parenting allowance component that was formerly home child care allowance will be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Around 260,000 families will receive more than $61 a fortnight. Overall, some 117,000 families are expected to gain around $59 a week from parenting allowance. Announced and introduced into Parliament in the International Year of the Family, the parenting allowance initiative will give the partner caring for the children an independent source of income, recognising financially the valuable work of the carer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill makes strategic changes to the income test for unemployed people to make sure that they will always be financially better of by increasing their work earnings. Under the current arrangements, every dollar of income earned above a modest amount causes the loss of a dollar of income support. This seriously diminishes the incentives for people to increase their earnings since they will generally be no better off overall unless the increase in their income is so substantial that they have no further need for income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 July 1995, all unemployed people will be able to earn $60 a fortnight before losing any income support. They will lose 50 cents for each dollar of extra income between $60 and $140 a fortnight and 70 cents for each dollar beyond that point. The new rule will apply to single unemployed persons and to couples unless one member of the couple is a pensioner. The new rule will generally replace the joint income test that has tended to discourage both partners from seeking work. The income of one member of a couple will start to affect the other partner's allowance only when the first partner loses entitlement to a social security benefit altogether. Based on current rates, the first partner will be able to earn $466 a fortnight before the other partner's payment will start to reduce. The reduction will then be 70 cents for each dollar of earnings. The existing joint income rules will continue to apply where one member of a couple is a pensioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill continues the elimination of social security payments based on dependence on another person that started with the withdrawal of the partner add-on rate component earlier this year. Payments are being redirected to individuals based on need in their own right. It also recognises the desirability for equity between social security clients, some of whom have to undertake activity testing to qualify for income support and some of whom do not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wife pension is currently available to a woman whose partner is receiving either age or disability support pension, disability wage supplement or rehabilitation allowance in certain circumstances. Mature age partner allowance is available to the partner of a mature age allowance recipient. Special needs wife pension is paid to a woman whose partner is receiving either special needs age or special needs disability support pension. All three payments are available without activity testing. There will be no new grants of any of these payments on or after 1 July 1995. However, people who claim and qualify for one of the payments on or before 30 June 1995 will have their entitlement "saved".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people affected by this proposal will qualify for another form of income support. Those with dependent children under 16 may claim the new parenting allowance. The full range of principal income support payments such as job search allowance or the various pensions will be available. Carer pension may be paid to those caring for an aged or disabled person. Partners aged 40 or more without recent labour force experience may claim the non-activity tested partner allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Partner allowance itself is being refined in line with other changes made by this Bill. People currently on partner allowance who have dependent children under 16 are expected to move to the new parenting allowance. Partner allowance will continue to be available to the partners of recipients of job search, newstart or sickness allowance or special benefit; it will also become available to the partners of recipients of age or disability support pension, rehabilitation or mature age allowance or disability wage supplement. However, it will be restricted to partners who are aged 40 or more with no recent workforce experience and no dependent children under 16. Current clients who do not fall into this category will need to claim income support in their own right, with most expected to move to job search allowance. If the client has been registered with the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) for the 12 months prior to 1 July 1995, newstart allowance will be available. Clients at risk of long term unemployment will be taken to have the same history of CES registration as their job search or newstart allowance partners so that they will have access to the same programs and job compacts as their partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also provides that a parenting allowance and a partner allowance will generally remain payable to a qualified person even if the person's partner is subject to a non-payment period and even if the partner's payment ceases, subject to meeting the income and assets tests. In a further amendment, parenting and partner allowance recipients will be entitled to health care cards in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new widow allowance is being introduced by this Bill. Since July 1987, there have been no new grants of widow B pension to women under age 50 at that date or to those under age 45 if they had previously been sole parent pensioners. This has been part of a strategy to remove from the social security program gender specific and non-activity tested payments for people of workforce age. Many women who would have qualified for widow B pension previously have moved onto other payments such as job search allowance and have had to undertake the usual job search activities to be able to get income support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, many of these women grew up in an era when it was not expected that they would ever work outside the home after marriage and have no recent workforce experience with which to confront the harsh realities of the job market. The new widow allowance is being introduced to ease the transition between the current provisions and the eventual phase out of the types of payment mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1 January 1995, widow allowance will be available to women who are widowed, divorced or separated, who become so after turning 50 and who have no recent workforce experience. The new allowance will be paid at the same rate and under the same income and assets tests as job search and newstart allowances but it will not be activity tested. Widow allowance will carry an entitlement to a health care card. Women receiving another payment immediately before 1 January 1995 may transfer to widow allowance without having to satisfy the recent workforce experience requirement. Women who have turned 60 and who have been beneficiaries for 12 months or more will be entitled to a pensioner concession card. There will be no new grants of widow allowance on or after 1 July 2005, except to women born before 1 July 1955. To avoid confusion, the current widowed person allowance will now be called bereavement allowance but will not otherwise be changed. The other measures in this Bill relate to advance pharmaceutical allowance and education entry payment. Advance pharmaceutical allowance was introduced in 1990, originally to operate until the end of 1991. The success of the scheme has resulted in its extension year by year. It is now to be extended indefinitely by the removal by this Bill of the "sunset" clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Education entry payment is currently available to recipients of certain social security payments to ease the costs associated with taking up study which may in turn improve the person's chances of finding work. The $200 payment is now being extended to recipients of partner allowance, wife pension and mature age partner allowance and to recipients of the new parenting and widow allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SUPPORTED ACCOMMODATION ASSISTANCE AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Senators, in the first of these bills, we have before us today a very important piece of legislation&mdash;the Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is important because it addresses a key objective of this Government's Social Justice Strategy and one of the most challenging issues in Australian social policy today&mdash;homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill signals a major step forward in the way we respond to homelessness in Australia and will set a new benchmark in the provision of services to help homeless men, women and young people overcome the cycle of disadvantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the first time a Labor Government has acted to revolutionise assistance to homeless people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill before us today is very much a legacy of the reforms that were begun by the Labor Government in 1974 with the passage of the Homeless Persons Assistance Act. This was the first piece of Commonwealth legislation which provided government assistance through community-based organisations to homeless people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Homelessness did not suddenly emerge in the 1970s&mdash;the first female immigrant's home was established in Sydney by Caroline Chisholm in 1841 and the Sydney City Mission began operating refuges for the homeless in 1861.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What was important about the Homeless Persons Assistance Act was that it was the first time that the Federal Government had recognised that it was the responsibility of national Government to provide assistance to homeless people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other important aspect of the legislation was that it dealt with homelessness as an issue of social policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the two decades following that ground breaking piece of legislation, Federal Labor Governments have shown leadership by playing a central and active role in responding to homelessness in Australia as a key objective of the national social policy agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1985, the Federal Labor Government created the first Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) by amalgamating the Homeless Persons Assistance Program, the Women's Emergency Services Program and the Youth Services Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP agreements were signed with all States and Territories. In 1989, a second round of agreements were signed with the States and Territories. Under these agreements SAAP grew to some 1600 services, consolidating a network of social infrastructure in regions across Australia which provided accommodation and support for homeless men, women and young people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is due to the contribution made by these services in this decade that Australian cities and towns do not present the same scenes of street living and begging as New York and London.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994, we have the opportunity to take the reform process in Australia one step further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation before Parliament today lays a new foundation for the third round of supported accommodation agreements to be signed between the Federal Government and State and Territory Governments by 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill sets a new framework for the provision of SAAP services. The focus is on assisting homeless people to achieve the maximum possible degree of independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to move SAAP from a program of last resort&mdash;a `safety net' for people who are homeless&mdash;to one which is active in helping them to change their lives. It seeks to change SAAP from a program which provides care to a program which provides care and opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past, we have not been active enough in taking this approach. We have allowed homeless people to remain marginalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Services have been built in the industrial parts of town&mdash;beside factories rather than in communities. We have paid great attention to providing beds for the night often at the expense of other services including labour market assistance, health and rehabilitation, childcare and long-term housing solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community has often accepted a lower standard of service for homeless people. This has perpetuated the myth that homelessness is threatening to the community&mdash;the images of sub-standard accommodation and associated violence and crime creating a stigma.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result has been that people who become homeless are vulnerable to entering a cycle of dependence that becomes a lifestyle&mdash;and very difficult to break out of.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP clients are among the most marginalised and powerless members of our community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On any given night up to 11,500 people are assisted by SAAP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">7500 of them are adults and 4000 are accompanying children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of these 7500, 56 per cent are male and 44 per cent female.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of women (52 per cent) are aged between 20 and 40 years of age.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Men tend to be older&mdash;10 per cent of men in SAAP are aged over 60, compared to 3 per cent of women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important statistic is that indigenous Australians account for 15 per cent of SAAP clients. They account for 1.6 per cent of the Australian population.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP is generally divided into four sectors. Youth accommodation accounts for 29 per cent of services; services for single men 26 per cent; services for women escaping domestic violence 12 per cent and services for families 12 per cent. People with children using SAAP account for 25 per cent of all clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People using SAAP are poor&mdash;87 per cent are reliant on Commonwealth Government benefits and a further 5 per cent have no income at all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this data illustrates, people who are homeless are extremely disadvantaged in Australian society and this bill establishes SAAP's place as central to achieving positive outcomes for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is based upon the principle that all Australians, regardless of their economic, social or housing status, have basic rights and responsibilities and that people who are homeless have the same entitlement to these rights and responsibilities as any other group in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Labor Government is concerned with building an Australia which is fair, which offers all its citizens opportunities to prosper, to enjoy fulfilling lives, to participate in their communities&mdash;in short, to exercise the rights of citizens and to fulfil the responsibilities which go with those rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have acted to protect the rights of all Australians by recognising international standards for the protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms. The Government has ratified human rights treaties in relation to civil, political, economic, social and cultural rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to eliminating racial discrimination and discrimination against women.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And we have enacted legislation which outlaws discrimination of the basis of gender and disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of these initiatives are designed to build social cohesion in Australia and a society which offers equal opportunities to all citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Supported Accommodation Assistance Bill recognises that we will not make advances in the area of homelessness without a recognition of the rights of homeless people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to a home is one of the most fundamental requisites for securing a decent quality of life. The bill seeks to make the rights of people who are homeless to housing and to the other essential elements of a decent quality of life central to the services provided for them and to the opportunities they are offered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It outlines the principles that underpin the provision of services to homeless people&mdash;respect for human dignity, respect for cultural background and beliefs and protection of universal human rights. These rights are to be advanced in conjunction with the responsibilities expected of clients while using SAAP services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also recognises the importance of housing to quality of life in the definition of `homeless' which is provided. This is the first time such a comprehensive definition has been included in Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Previous definitions have constrained `homeless' to traditional interpretations of total absence of shelter&mdash;literally living on the streets, sleeping in parks, derelict buildings or railway stations for want of anywhere else to go.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of `homeless' in this bill recognises homelessness as being more complex than the absolute absence of shelter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition provides that a person is homeless if he or she has inadequate access to safe and secure shelter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of inadequate access to safe and secure shelter encompasses health and safety issues, the physical environment and the economic and social supports a home would normally offer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An example of a situation which this definition intends to cover is the case of a woman and her children being subjected to continued violence in the family home. Because the woman's health is at risk, the home is rendered unsafe and the woman would be considered to have `inadequate access to safe and secure shelter' and to be at imminent risk of homelessness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill recognises that SAAP does not operate in isolation. It takes account of the factors which lead to crisis, both economic and social, and which influence the outcomes of our attempts to redress crisis and assist people who are homeless to regain independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These influences are complex and varied and extend beyond access to housing, that is to thinking a person's crisis is solved through merely providing a roof over their head. The issues relate to health, to employment, to security of income, to the person's capacity to build and maintain personal relationships, to violence and to the legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill sets objectives for SAAP which link the provision of shelter with all of these other services. It provides for a system in which case managers work with individuals to put together a package of assistance to suit their needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be that an older single man who has been homeless for some time and who is eligible for the Job Compact is provided with labour market assistance at the same time as SAAP provides his accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A woman escaping domestic violence will be provided with accommodation for herself and for her children and at the same time provided with childcare and related support so that she can start to look for employment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A homeless family will be provided with counselling at the same time as the SAAP case manager organises rent assistance and social security to find the family a suitable house for private rental.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill asserts the right of homeless people to the full range of government services and community resources and to participate fully in their communities&mdash;the same universal human rights other members of the community take for granted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It provides the framework and impetus for more innovative and integrated responses to the issues which face homeless people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is about maximising people's chances to participate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government provided an additional $19 million in the last Federal Budget to deliver this new approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community will be closely involved with the implementation of this new approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the reform process, a Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Homelessness will be established. It will provide people who are homeless and the wider community with the opportunity to be directly involved in the new SAAP program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Committee overcomes the current fragmented approach to community participation in SAAP. It will provide national leadership in both advocacy and policy development for people who are homeless.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But if people who are homeless are to take their rightful place in the community we must increase understanding in the community of homelessness. The Department of Housing and Regional Development will be undertaking a targeted public awareness campaign during the 1995 United Nations International Year of Tolerance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major messages of this initiative will be that homelessness is not the result of individual failing, but the effect of a complex range of social and economic influences and that homelessness is not a permanent condition. With the right support and assistance, most people who are homeless can regain independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This campaign will also bring to the public's notice the detrimental effects of attitudes which exclude homeless people from communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP is to continue at least until 30 June 1999, with the Commonwealth and the States and Territories maintaining their relative contributions over this time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1994-95, we are contributing $104.9 million towards SAAP, while the States' combined contribution is $80 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Government has approved additional funds to foster the reforms to SAAP I have outlined above. In 1994-95, $3.9 million in additional Commonwealth funding is committed for this purpose, rising to $4.5 million in 1995-96 through to 1997-98.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also includes provisions to ensure that members of the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Homelessness receive  adequate remuneration for their expertise and for their time and efforts in participating on such a committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Remuneration costs for committee members together with running costs for the operation of the committee are not anticipated to exceed $60,000 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second bill, the Supported Accommodation Assistance Amendment Bill, amends the Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1989 to prevent the Commonwealth entering into an agreement, or authorising payments, under that Act after the date on which the first State or Territory enters into an agreement under the new Supported Accommodation Assistance Act 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of services that the community provides to people who are homeless is a test of our collective commitment to social justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Combating homelessness is a national policy goal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It requires a strong national effort to achieve results, leadership by the Federal Government and the collective commitment of the States and Territories and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government will provide the leadership required to make this a truly national step forward&mdash;with each State and Territory with us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this bill, this Government has taken the opportunity to move SAAP forward to become not only a responsive and suitable service to meet the immediate needs of people who are homeless, but for many of them, the point in their lives when they were offered the opportunity to move forward towards greater independence and control over their own lives.</PARA>

Senator Harradine wanted to speak on that matter, on which we otherwise had had full debate. There was a variety of views in relation to the three parts of the amendment. The government, the Democrats and the Greens had indicated that they would give support in relation to subsection (7). There generally seemed to be consensus. There was an amendment moved to delete (8) and (9). Senator Harradine had not spoken on that matter but wished to do so. I therefore ask that that amendment be deferred because he is not in the chamber. It might be timely to move to coalition amendment No. 10, which was deferred for redrafting.

I think everybody is in agreement that part (7) should operate&mdash;that is, there should be a tabling of the documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is whether the strategy is to be a disallowable instrument. Arguments have been advanced that this would go against the thrust of what the opposition, the Greens and I have intended, and that is to ensure that as much autonomy as is possible within our democratic system is to be given to the corporation in the exercise of its land acquisition and land management functions. That has been one of the basic premises upon which the amendments have been advanced and supported by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, this appears to take a step back from that, but I do not see that situation at all, because this parliament is a parliament not only for white Australians but for indigenous Australians as well. That is the important point. I believe we would be failing in our duty to Aboriginal peoples if we were not to ensure that part (8) is incorporated. The reason I say that is that in any executive government appointed body there will inevitably be an influence exercised by the person who appoints that particular body. When I say `inevitably', that is probably taking it too far. There is a very real likelihood that that could occur, either directly or indirectly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of that could be that a number of Aboriginal persons would be seriously disaffected by the national strategy that is being developed, notwithstanding the fact that we have moved amendments, which have been adopted, that the national strategy has to emerge out of regional strategies. Nonetheless, I believe that Aboriginal Australians are as entitled to have the national parliament consider seriously the question of the national strategy as any other Australian is entitled to in the normal course of events so as to question the power and the possible influence of the executive government and perhaps an undue influence on strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Native Title Act there are disallowable instruments&mdash;there is a heap of disallowable regulations, at least. I will not go into them, but most of them deal directly with determinations made by the minister. The same is the case in three other Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander related pieces of legislation. There are disallowable instruments in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Reserves and Communities Self-management) Act 1978, as well as the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, most of those relate to ministerial decisions. However, I will give an example of some that do not. Under the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act both houses may restore to office a regional councillor suspended from office by ATSIC. I did not hear the argument advanced during debate on that legislation that that should not be a disallowable instrument on the basis that it is interfering with the autonomy of ATSIC which, after all, is an elected body, not an appointed body&mdash;or it will be. Under that act, both houses may restore to office a chairperson or deputy chairperson of a regional council suspended from office by the minister. That is a direct matter. People might say, `Unanimously we agree that a direct executive government decision such as that ought not to escape the overview of the parliament.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot say that what the opposition is proposing in this amendment offends in the way that it has suggested. In fact, that particular provision would seem to be even more of an interference than the one that is currently being proposed. I remind the committee that we are only suggesting that it be a disallowable instrument; we are not suggesting that we are going to be altering or amending the national strategy. The strategy would have to have rather extraordinary failings if a matter were such that it would be disallowed by either house of parliament. We would have to have an enormous upsurge of discontent amongst those affected, or likely to be affected, by the national strategy before we could get the numbers in either house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am going to put one view which I think is very important in our quest to achieve what Senator Harradine has been arguing for&mdash;that is, that the strategy not only be tabled but also be disallowable. A thought which has just occurred to me should, I hope, appeal to the Greens because of the importance they particularly have placed on the national strategies reflecting the regional strategies&mdash;that is, a grassroots-up approach to creating the national strategy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already been through the arguments about ensuring that, if the national strategy takes place, after all the consultation the Senate has now mandated is required under the law, the ILC board could still do the consultation but could still have a strategy that does not reflect that consultation. There is a requirement because of the J series of amendments that the national strategy reflect the regional strategy. But the reality of it is that if the national strategy does not reflect the regional strategies&mdash;as Senator Harradine has articulately put it&mdash;Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would have no ultimate redress or leverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy will be tabled here. Senator Chamarette and Senator Campbell may not like the national strategy, nor might every Aboriginal person in Australia. But it would not matter how much they jumped up and down about it or how often they wrote letters to us saying, `This national strategy has betrayed everything the board said that it would be,' because, unless it is disallowable, they would have no leverage. That is an ultimately sensible argument as to why that leverage should be put in place by supporting amendment 20 to subsection (8). Ultimately, the national strategy may not honestly represent the regional strategies. It may not reflect those and it may not derive from those, even though we require that it should. Ultimately, no-one has any say as to whether it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Harradine says, it would be a most unlikely thing for the parliament to disallow. But the reality is that Aboriginal people would have this power in their hands if the strategy put forward by their leaders did not reflect those regional strategies. I urge the committee to strongly consider that argument, which, in a very real way, makes the case for putting the power in the hands of those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens have given their reasons twice, so I will not repeat them. But I will respond to Senator Harradine and to Senator Campbell. I was particularly moved by Senator Harradine's comments, and there is a validity to the argument presented. Nevertheless, there are two reasons why the Greens will not be supporting this. One reason is that the parliamentary system is essentially an imperfect system. It is even more so in terms of representing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that, because it is up to the whim of representation in the parliament and the numbers and unrelated to content, the way in which a disallowance motion will be eventually decided will have more to do with the numbers in the parliament and the capacity to disrupt than the actual wishes of the Aboriginal people regarding the content to which they object. I have great sympathy with the need of Aboriginal people to have a capacity to challenge the national strategy. There is extreme importance in the argument that Senator Campbell raised: what if the national strategy does not reflect the regional strategies as required by our amendments? What redress or leverage do Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My response is that I do not feel that making it a disallowable instrument is the ideal way to give them leverage because I think it gives too much leverage to make them a political football&mdash;and we know, we have had those concerns raised. I do think they have one mechanism&mdash;and that is what reassures me&mdash;and that is, it can go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; it does run to the way in which the minister undertakes office. If there are problems with that then I believe that the content can be challenged. As I am much more concerned about the content being challenged by the Aboriginal people who have the concerns, I would prefer that method of redress and leverage rather than support what I think is a perfectly reasonable suggestion of the tabled document becoming a disallowable instrument. </PARA>

We all in here know a great deal about the politics of disallowance. Having added cumulative layers of process here, it is neither right nor appropriate for us to give parliament the opportunity to disallow in this case because to do so will cause huge and unacceptable delays that would undermine the whole purpose that we have spent a lot of time putting in place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am considering withdrawing these amendments, but I want to put on the record why they were drafted in the first place and then get a response from the government on this matter. We had a lot of discussion on Monday about whether or not the fund should be in the public account and what effect that would have on the deficit. The Democrats had considered that, but I guess our paramount concern was that the land fund should be self-sustaining, as the government promised that it would be. That required the fund eventually being able to achieve investment returns in each year higher than dispersals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Senate finance and public administration hearing, we heard evidence from investment advisers J. P. Morgan which I think casts some doubt on whether this self-sustainability could be achieved under the government's plan of investing in a fairly narrow range of cash instruments. J. P. Morgan&mdash;and I concede this is just one form of external advice&mdash;argued that diversifying the portfolio would allow a higher level of return for any given level of risk. They argued that on diversified investment of a securitised fund it could be as much as $300 million or 20 per cent larger in 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was important for us to consider that option. On that basis we drafted amendments to achieve that. Our amendments had three key parts. Firstly, the investment of the land fund was to be done by professional investment managers with more input from the business and Aboriginal communities through a committee of advisers. Secondly, the land fund was to have wider investment powers similar to those of trustees in general law. Thirdly, the guaranteed appropriations to the land fund were to be securitised, allowing for an immediate issue of land fund bonds and investment of the full amount of the land fund. Apart from J. P. Morgan, various other private sector advisers told us that this model was workable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, through the Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, raised with us its serious concerns about this proposal. Its central concern was with the proposal to securitise the funds appropriations into an issue of index bonds. Representatives of Treasury argued that recent issues of index bonds had not marketed very well and that there were very grave doubts about whether a market float of specific land fund bonds would raise an appropriate return. They talked about a very recent experience with index bonds and the way in which that placed grave doubt on the realisable value of the fund, which would in turn reduce the base from which returns on a diversified portfolio would run. So that is their first concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing they said to us was that they were concerned about allowing for diversified investments. They argued that while cash instruments have performed poorly in the last year over time, a four per cent real return needed to sustain the fund was quite feasible. They also pointed out that existing audit legislation, despite what we said on Tuesday about other models, in fact allows the finance minister to invest in a diversified portfolio, although this is a power which is seldom used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Minister for Finance and Treasury officials argued that they were sufficiently confident of achieving a four per cent return. We said, `Well, we don't want to just rely on your confidence. We'd like to actually make sure it happens.' When I move to 193AA and my amendment (8)(a), I will tell honourable senators why we will accept the so-called top up proposal in preference to pursuing this fairly complicated structure to achieve a more diversified portfolio.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very clear recognition&mdash;by experts in Aboriginal affairs as well as by the man in the street&mdash;that we spend a lot of money, not only on Aboriginal affairs but on all sorts of other programs to assist disadvantaged Australians. In fact, billions of dollars are spent to assist disadvantaged people. But there is also a clear recognition&mdash;this can be heard standing at the bar, at a barbecue or just about anywhere&mdash;that there is a lot of inefficiency in the bureaucracy and in the delivery of that well-intentioned assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably unfairly, a lot of people perceive that in the area of Aboriginal affairs there is a lack of efficiency in the delivery of assistance. As I said earlier, people see the billions of dollars that Senator Collins talked about going to Aboriginal people but, after years and years of programs implemented by well-intentioned governments of both political persuasions, the plight of Aboriginal people does not seem to have improved very much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a genuine attempt to assist disadvantaged Aboriginals, particularly those who have been disadvantaged as a result of their dispossession. But we also have&mdash;and the federal government has made no attempt to hide this fact&mdash;the effective establishment of two land funds. One is already provided for with ATSIC. On page 12 of the current additional estimates statement of the Department of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs there is stated the specific objective `to promote economic independence and support the social and cultural development of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples through the land acquisition and management and the business funding scheme programs'. So that is already in place; there is already an administration within ATSIC that is doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it now stands, the government's bill creates a new administration with new administrative expenses and new overheads such that there will be two parallel administrations over what the government calls a transitional period. But in seeking to establish a function like that, we really should be trying to avoid duplication. We have already heard in this debate that there is significant duplication between state and federal initiatives in the area of Aboriginal affairs, including land functions. Here the government is clearly saying that it will be setting up two operations which will run parallel for a period of three years&mdash;that is, up until 1997. That means we will have two administrations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of the coalition's amendments is to ensure that the money that is already going into the land acquisition functions of ATSIC is not directed back to the ILC, syphoned through and then back to ATSIC again, but that all of it goes into the ILC, and that the administration of the ILC is efficient and therefore maximise the money that can be applied to land acquisition and management for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The amendments ensure that that money is not chewed up in a dual administration of what is quintessentially an identical administrative function. That is the nub of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it is quite outrageous to suggest that we seek to assist Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in acquiring land when what we are effectively doing is ensuring that the people who get the real assistance and the real benefit are the administrators here in Canberra. That is something that riles all sorts of people. As I said earlier in the week, it riles the redneck people who like to kick the anti-Aboriginal can because they just talk about the Aboriginal industry and the Aboriginal bureaucracy and use this sort of foolishness as an excuse to kick that often racist can. But it could also be very upsetting to those of us who do have a genuine concern at trying to see Aboriginal disadvantage overcome. I do not think any of us would like to see more bureaucracy and more administrative expense in these sorts of programs than is absolutely necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be further amendments dealing with this problem. Senator Chamarette is proposing&mdash;I do not know whether the amendment has been circulated yet; it may be in the stack of paper on my desk&mdash;to deal the administration expense side of things further down the track today. The effect of the coalition amendments is to ensure that all of the money flows into the ILC, that the administration is efficient and that we do not have this duplication for what the government calls a transitional period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that a transition period is simply not necessary on any basis. The government has not put in any of the hearings on the bill or any arguments publicly or privately that there is some sensible, practical, administrative reason why we should have these two funds. I have used in the arguments in the minority report the establishment of the Australian Securities Commission as an example of a massively more complicated Commonwealth body that effectively was up and running within a few months with virtually no transitional period. It had to amalgamate the companies officers in six different states and the territories. It had to move from the state administration of companies law to the federal administration of companies law, where it was dealing with something like 900,000 clients, 900,000 corporations, and that transition was effectively achieved under the chairmanship of Mr Hartnell within a period of a few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is no administrative practical reason why we need to have this three-year handover. What it is really inviting to happen is that there will a dual administration, much more expense allocated to administration than is required and, therefore, ipso facto, a diminishing of the amount of Commonwealth resource that is go to the clear objective of the land fund, and that is to assist Aboriginal people. That is the intent of our series of amendments and I commend them to the chamber. </PARA>

What I have heard is that it was initially a deal with the Northern Territory government essentially against the interests of the Aboriginal people by preventing them from using any of the ILC funds under the land rights legislation in the Northern Territory. There was then a double deal&mdash;or a counter deal&mdash;with the Aboriginal people that said, `It's all right; half will still be going to ATSIC', and then presumably to the Northern Territory people who would be disadvantaged by the first deal in order to gain access under the Land Rights Northern Territory Act.'</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is interesting that when we get an agreement with the Greens it is referred to as an agreement; when we get an agreement with anyone else it is called a deal. I suppose it is just a question of where we sit in the arrangement. It is an absolute fact that these are transitional arrangements, unabashedly so, and they are part of an agreement that was reached after a lot of negotiation with representatives of Aboriginal organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that the Greens have a view that the existing provisions of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act that conversions of pastoral land in the Northern Territory should be able to continue past 1997&mdash;which is a provision of the act which has existed for some 18 years&mdash;should not be there. I respectfully disagree with that view. As the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentary Record</EMPHASIS> will indicate, I have respectfully disagreed with that view for over a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those were transitional arrangements also that were brought in originally in the Northern Territory Land Rights Act. Frankly, I think the period that was allowed to 1997 for those conversions to take place&mdash;which can mean, effectively, that pastoral property can be taken out of production if that is the end result after conversion&mdash;was a fair go. I certainly do not support any suggestion that that should be removed. I might add that the land councils that operate very professionally in the Northern Territory do not exactly faint at the prospect either. In fact, it is something that they have been working with now for almost 20 years and are well and truly capable of handling when the time comes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC has built up a substantial degree of expertise in land acquisition for Aboriginal people in Australia. Applications have already been received and processed for the 1994-95 year and all the funds have been allocated. The continuation of ATSIC's land acquisition until 1996-97 will ensure a smooth transition. During this period ATSIC will have time to finalise and put to rest all of its final purchases and land management arrangements that are already in place. We have had extensive discussions with Aboriginal groups, and I can assure Senator Chamarette that we have no doubt at all that ATSIC and the ILC will work with total cooperation during this period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just mention in passing that ATSIC operates and has operated&mdash;and inherited from previous administrations&mdash;a concessional home loan scheme for Aboriginal people. That scheme in various forms has been operating certainly most of my life, to the best of my knowledge. The reason I mention in passing ATSIC's long experience and expertise in doing these things&mdash;I just make that point&mdash;is that that is very similar in nature to the proposal which by way of amendment has been brought into the ILC arrangements in respect of purchasing individual property. Let us put it right on the line: this means houses for Aboriginal people to have individual title to and do what they will with.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental difference is that the ATSIC scheme, which has operated for a very long time and which is a concessional scheme, provides a loan which does have to be repaid, not unreasonably, by the Aboriginal purchaser, who does get the advantage of getting concessional rates as a recognition of the economic difficulties that most Aboriginal people in Australia have. It may well be that Senator Ellison and Senator Campbell are not even aware of the details of that scheme, which has a quite complex stepped arrangement for concessional loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to Senator Chamarette that I have a strong view that that has been a very appropriate and welcome form of assistance for helping Aboriginal people acquire housing in their own right, to do what they will with. It has worked very well indeed. It is an appropriate way of doing it, as against the totally inappropriately way of doing it&mdash;again, to my total astonishment, with the support of the coalition&mdash;that has been put in this bill. It is precisely a transitional arrangement. That explanation has been given by the government. It came out of intense negotiations with all parties concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with many agreements, not everybody is entirely happy with the arrangement. One group that has expressed some dissatisfaction is the Northern Territory government. I have to say that there is some validity&mdash;and I have said this publicly for more than 10 years now&mdash;in the Northern Territory government's quite legitimate concern as managers of pastoral land in the Northern Territory that for an indefinite period of time there is a possibility of not just land acquisition but that with conversion the land can be put to another use. It would not worry me if every pastoral property in the territory and in the Kimberleys was being run and operated by Aboriginal pastoralists, as many are. The problem is that there would be no requirement that it continue as an operating pastoral concern. Those concerns by the Northern Territory government are legitimate. However, I do not believe its criticism of these arrangements is legitimate at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette referred to this matter; that is the reason I mentioned it. She refers to double deals being done. That is utter nonsense. What the Northern Territory government was legitimately concerned about was that under the existing arrangements, if an additional and substantial sum of money was provided, effectively doubling the land acquisition capacity of Aboriginal people, this would lead&mdash;particularly in depressed times when land prices on pastoral properties are down and when there is no question that there are pastoralists who would be attracted by offers to exit their properties&mdash;to some sort of huge land acquisition in the Northern Territory, with the consequent conversion meaning that significant parts of the Northern Territory pastoral industry would disappear. That is an entirely unwarranted concern, in my view; and I have said so many times. It is an exaggerated view of what would be likely to happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns Senator Chamarette raised on behalf of the Northern Territory government that some double deal was done related to the agreement the government then sensibly reached that new money would not be used for that purpose but that ATSIC could continue until the cut-off date of 1997 to use its acquisition powers to continue, as it has been for years, to acquire&mdash;when it takes the decision in terms of its priorities&mdash;pastoral properties in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only fear that would then be raised, and I am prepared to bet large sums of money that this is not going to happen, is that the $21 million of ATSIC funds would be used&mdash;this is what Marshall Perron was referring to in terms of his reference to double dealing; and it is a nonsense scenario&mdash;exclusively or largely over the next three years to purchase land in the Northern Territory to the exclusion of everywhere else in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Chamarette is extremely familiar with Aboriginal organisations, with Aboriginal politics and with the fact that they play it as hard as or harder than everyone else. She would also be familiar with the fact that there are three Northern Territory commissioners out of the 20 on ATSIC. As I say, I am prepared to bet Senator Chamarette a huge sum of money&mdash;any sum she would like to name&mdash;that the prospect of ATSIC's land acquisition funds exclusively being devoted to land purchases in the Northern Territory is a highly unlikely scenario indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I confidently predict will happen is that the pattern of purchases by ATSIC over the next three years in the Northern Territory will continue very largely as it has since ATSIC was set up, because the same balance of power exists on the commission. There are the same broad range of interests across Australia and the same priorities will continue to apply to that $21 million fund for the transitional period that it continues to operate. That is the explanation. I do not believe that Senator Chamarette's reference to or her concerns about this double deal are valid for the reasons that I have just given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the transitional arrangements are concerned, I believe they have considerable merit in allowing ATSIC, after a long period of being in the land acquisition business, to gradually wind down its operations over that period while at the same time allowing the ILC to establish its expertise. The government is absolutely assured by ATSIC that there will be no difficulty at all with these transitional arrangements being handled professionally, competently and cooperatively by the Aboriginal organisations concerned. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 41 of the ATSIC annual report, under `Land Acquisition,' three of the most important issues for the management of this program in 1993-94 were listed. The first one was:</PARA>

However, I respectfully suggest to all senators that the third issue&mdash;that is, `developing protocols for ATSIC's interaction with the proposed ILC'&mdash;supports our argument enormously. Instead of having people in the land acquisition section of ATSIC developing protocols for ATSIC's interaction with the ILC, those people should be integrating with the ILC right now&mdash;not wasting time developing protocols. They should be developing an integrated organisation called the ILC with the sole objective of delivering assistance to the Aboriginals whom we are seeking to assist with this legislation. They should be seeking to assist the Aboriginals to acquire land and work out appropriate ways of managing that land and assisting those people&mdash;not sitting inside some ivory tower in Canberra and developing protocols to see how the two organisations are going to get on together between now and 1997. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an absolutely classic example of duplication, government waste and inefficiency. Who are the people who miss out under this?&mdash;Torres Strait Islander and Aboriginal people who want redress and assistance because of their dispossession and their disadvantage. There is no practical reason that this minister or Senator Kernot has given as to why we should have this stupid three year transitional period where we will have administrative expenses doubled at the cost of the people that Senator Kernot seeks to represent here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is quite right; there is a balance between the states about where ATSIC spends its money. The minister may be aware that in the last year this report covers the expenditure was of the order of $2.2 million in the Northern Territory. What was the running cost of the whole program in this last financial year? The running cost of the ATSIC land acquisition program was just under $3 million. All of the money spent on purchasing pastoral properties in the Northern Territory in the last financial year was less than what was spent on administration here in Canberra. So more money went into paying bureaucrats in Canberra to administer the program than for all the pastoral leases purchased in the whole of the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we going to do here? We are going to set up a new administration and spend another $3 million to administer land acquisitions. So we will have two lots of administrative expenses instead of one. Again, we could take all of the purchases in the Northern Territory for the last year and pump them into more bureaucracy in Canberra, because the government wants to have two funds instead of one. Senator Chamarette hit the nail absolutely right on the head. Whether it is called an agreement or a deal makes no difference, because it is the consideration involved. The consideration here was that Mr Keating tried to get Marshall Perron to support the concept of the land fund. Marshall Perron said, `I'll support it as long as you don't spend all the money buying pastoral leases in the Northern Territory.' That is where proposed section 191U came from.

The date of the sunset provision is to ensure that the government can get around that promise. It reminds me of the promise Mr Keating made to the premiers in June last year.

We have not given any commitments that we are going to abrogate that legislated commitment. Aboriginal people will have the opportunity to continue to acquire and convert land, as the land rights act says they can, until 1997. There was no commitment given, despite the protestations of Chief Minister Perron. Chief Minister Perron wanted more than we were prepared to give. That is a fact. In fact, what he got was a positive response from this government and the arrangement that was then publicly announced. He is now complaining about that because he wanted that legislative commitment to be abrogated.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of all of those reasons, the Northern Territory government not only has nothing to fear from these arrangements but knows perfectly well that the arrangements that have been operating for years will simply continue until the cut-off date, which has been in the legislation for almost 10 years, is exercised in 1997. That did not come as a shocking surprise to the government, despite Senator Campbell's protestations. As a result also of the long-time involvement of ATSIC in land acquisition, it is pleased&mdash;and I might add that everyone else I have talked to is pleased&mdash;that a transitional arrangement will be set in place that will allow it to gradually get out of that business and the ILC to gradually come into it.

The Greens (WA) are concerned that the fund will not be sufficient to meet the land ownership needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and that it will not be self-sustaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two other funds have already been mentioned and I would like to look at those. The first is the ATSIC fund. There is provision in the ATSIC Act for funding to be provided to Aboriginal corporations and communities to assist with land management as well as land acquisition. As we have already pointed out, demand for land management funds under the act outstrips the moneys available. ATSIC already spends some $9 million on funding land management, having decided that it could not meet the demand last year of $13 million. Clearly, the $21 million ATSIC land fund could never meet the acquisition and management requests made of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, this legislation would enable ATSIC to provide land management funding for any Aboriginal held land, not simply land acquired under the fund, so demands on the fund could be unlimited. The ILC's land management function is defined at section 191E and it also relates to any indigenous held land, not only land purchased under the powers granted by this bill. So we are duplicating the amount of money available in the ATSIC land fund at the moment while extending to an almost infinite degree the scope of purposes for which that money is meant to provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know from the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account report on the trust created under the 1976 Northern Territory land rights act that demand for funds generally exceeds funds available by a ratio of at least five to one. It is inconceivable that the $45 million per year that would eventually flow to the ILC after the three-year transitional arrangement period could in any way meet the demands placed on it for land management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we review some of the benefits of the Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account to land acquisition and management, we learn that 1993-94 was a lean year for those seeking grants, with only $16 million being approved. In 1990-91, as a result of the review of the long-term strategy of the trust account, it was possible to set aside $22 million as an investment reserve while approving grants of $20 million, of which $16 million was earmarked for land acquisition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see that in one year the Northern Territory Aboriginal Benefit Trust Account has allocated virtually the same amount that this government is allocating by way of additional funding through the ILC. I think that comparison is quite appropriate. It also points out the difficulties with the amount. If the ABTA could approve $16 million in one year for land acquisition for the benefit of Northern Territory Aboriginal groups, how far will $45 million annually go?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those two funds&mdash;the ATSIC fund and the ABTA fund&mdash;illustrate the paucity of the allocation of $45 million, which is, as we know, only $24 million more than what is currently available through the ATSIC fund. I think I have earlier mentioned the New South Wales land fund. In the end, that will be of almost as much benefit to the people of New South Wales as the fund being set up under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) believe that the fund is extremely unlikely&mdash;I think I should speak of it in stronger terms, but I will not&mdash;to provide any degree of historical justice for the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who will not gain anything from the recognition of native title because their native title has already been extinguished. So our Greens (WA) amendment A1 proposes that the House of Representatives amend the bill so that one per cent of total Commonwealth government revenues be placed in the land fund per annum for 10 years. This would see the government contribution exceed $11 billion at the end of 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to ask, and we would like to reply, why one per cent? The first reason for that is because it is a substantial sum, which could, we believe, satisfactorily address the land needs of Australia's indigenous people. One per cent of total revenue would see a government contribute about $1.12 billion per annum, a genuine billion dollar fund, not a spurious one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it was in 1890, when the British handed self-government to Western Australia, that there was a clause placed in the Western Australian constitution to ensure that the new government of Western Australia fulfilled its obligations to protect Aboriginal people. Under that clause, one per cent of total government revenue had to be spent on WA indigenous people. The clause disappeared in 1904 without that money being spent, and early this year a group of Aboriginal people began a challenge on this issue in the High Court. Section 70 of the Western Australian constitution provided that a sum of 5,000 would be set aside each year from the consolidated  revenue fund for the welfare of the Aboriginal people of the state. I will give honourable senators the quotes because it shows that even in 1889 there was a sense of justice regarding the provision for the indigenous people of this country. The section states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provided always, that if and when the gross revenue of the Colony shall exceed 500,000 pounds in any financial year, an amount equal to ONE PERCENT on such gross revenue shall, for the purposes of this section, be substitute for the said 5,000 pounds in and for the financial year next ensuing.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that the imperial parliament was not prepared to leave the well-being of the Aboriginal people to the whim of the colonial government and sought to make this permanent provision. How wise of it. Sadly, the colonial government sought to amend this section of the constitution almost as soon as signed copies were delivered from London. It was long accepted that at some point in the history of the state the attempt to amend the section was successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This notion is currently under dispute in the courts, but a decision is a long way off. In arguing for one per cent of federal government revenues to be set aside for the land fund, the Greens (WA) are using the imperial parliament's imposition on the WA colonial government as a precedent. We use it as a model. We have a rationale for our amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What, may I ask, is the government's rationale? I suggest that how much it can afford might have been a more important imperative for this government. What will not affect the budget deficit in even the slightest way may have been another rationale. What will sound good is more intriguing. How did it ever fit on $1 billion, of which nothing but $450 million would ever reach Aboriginal people? A billion dollar fund sounds really good. In a letter to me dated 17 October 1994, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the Land Fund was agreed to at that time.</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring here to the time when the native title rights were recognised by the High Court and then introduced into Commonwealth legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is now establishing a unique set of arrangements including a commitment to future appropriations for 9 years and a permanently sustainable fund to meet the land needs of those who will not benefit from the Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>In that letter he does mention the aims of the fund but he does not indicate how on earth he thinks his allocation of $45 million a year is ever going to meet that, so I would like to quote from his letter to me dated 11 October in which he sees that I have difficulty understanding the central importance of this paltry and disgraceful fund put in place by this legislation. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is why the Land Fund is central to the Government's social justice measures.</PARA>
<PARA>He has already said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was extremely disappointed to hear of your concerns in relation to the Land Fund Bill, particularly as we are both committed to pursuing justice for Australia's indigenous peoples.</PARA>
<PARA>He then goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the major financial component of social justice measures arising from the Mabo decision, and is aimed primarily at providing land for the majority of indigenous people unable to benefit from the native title legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to comment on my concerns:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that you have recently indicated a view that the money allocated is not enough. However in your submission in the Budget context, the Greens advocated an allocation of $1 billion over three years. In terms of quantum, the Government has more than met that requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>Now we have the answer to the third rationale I suggested that was a little more subtle. Why did the government choose $1 million? I think it chose it so that the Greens would in some way be pushed to support it, because it bore a very vague and superficial resemblance to our budget suggestion for Aboriginal people, which was $1 billion over three years. What we meant was that they would actually receive that amount of money, and we suggest-</PARA>
<PARA>ed, so that it did not blow out the budget deficit and did not cause any problems, that it could be given on the basis of a third each year for three years. We were not assuming it would stop there. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that the Bill meets the aspirations of the great majority of indigenous people in relation to land.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why in our budget submission we asked for only $1 billion over three years. When we saw that all that the government was prepared to allow was $450 million over 10 years, but that it was calling it a billion dollar fund, we thought we should challenge the government and produce the rationale to make it a genuine billion dollar fund, that is, $1 billion each year. The Prime Minister agrees. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It can of course be argued that no amount of money could be enough. However, given the need to be economically responsible&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that supports rationale No. 1&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government has decided on the amount specified in the Bill, an amount seen as satisfactory by the majority of indigenous representatives consulted.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Prime Minister: how many of those indigenous representatives consulted agree with it now when they realise that that billion dollar fund was a sleight of hand and it meant that they would be receiving $24 million a year more than they presently receive? I am extremely disappointed that the government, with all its high-sounding rhetoric, is unable to really respond to the needs of Aboriginal people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Campbell. We can see from the diagram I have had incorporated the dismal proportion of one year's allocation to the land fund. If we want to compare it with the 10-year amount that is going to remain in the government trust fund, we can simply look at the costs of Parliament House, which will give the 10-year equivalent. If we look at the annual defence budget we can see that what we are suggesting in the Greens amendment as an appropriate 10-year amount to be given for this land fund is the same as one year's defence expenditure. The allocation of $450 million in draw downs that Aboriginal people will receive under this legislation, providing administration and land management costs do not eat into it totally, will be approximately half of what we are quite prepared to pay for each Collins class submarine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the point has not been lost on my colleagues. What we are offering in terms of the money that the Prime Minister promised will redress the dispossession of Aboriginal people over 200 years and meet the aspirations and hopes of the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who do not stand to gain anything under native title is appalling. It is appalling that the government is stating that there is any capacity in this fund to do anything but continue the squabbling over tea, flour and sugar which we gave to the Aboriginal people of this land. We have given them nothing over this 200 years that we have oppressed them in their own country. That comparison, I believe, is sufficiently vivid. I would like to close with my response to the Prime Minister's urging me to support his land fund. In my reply of 11 October to the Prime Minister I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the bill Australia's indigenous people will only get $24 million more a year than they already receive through ATSIC.</PARA>
<PARA>They will get that indefinitely. It will never increase beyond that amount&mdash;but it will be diminished. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This money not only has to be used to acquire land but also to manage large areas of indigenous-held land across Australia. $3 million of it is also expected to be spent on running the bureaucracy. It is totally inappropriate to call it a `billion dollar fund' when the fund will simply be a paper exercise between ATSIC and the Department of Finance and the bulk of the money never leaves the public account. The total payments out of the fund over 10 years will not exceed $450 million and of that only $210 million can be regarded as additional to the current position.</PARA>
<PARA>I said to the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Government's commitment to redressing indigenous disadvantage is seriously in doubt if the Land Fund is to serve as the central indication of your resolve. The Government's proposal can do little to provide&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and here I am quoting his words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`land for the majority of indigenous people unable to benefit from the native title legislation'.</PARA>
<PARA>I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Aboriginal people can hold out little hope for the rest of the social justice package if this is, as you say&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and I again quote the Prime Minister's words&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`the major financial component of social justice measures arising from the Mabo decision'.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all I wish to say about the size of the fund. I will just speak briefly to amendment A2, which relates to the fact that the sum of money is so little, is in the public account and is totally tied away from the hands of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment A2 seeks the relaxation of what investments the ILC can invest money in to any trustee investment in a state, territory or the Commonwealth. It still allows for only very secure investments. The clause also ensures that 75 per cent of the money provided each year under amendment A1 will be invested; that is, we are proposing that, if the government genuinely gives a billion dollars in its fund to Aboriginal people, we are happy for that billion dollars to be in the public account. What we are asking for is a draw down of 25 per cent of that amount, which would be approximately $250 million, providing the remainder is invested and available for investment in secure investments that retain that quantity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just presented the case for the Greens' amendments. We are not anticipating any support in the chamber for our amendments, but I cannot stress more strongly that, if we support this bill with this amount of money, we are writing out the capacity for justice to be restored to the indigenous people of this land. We are writing it out not just for 10 years but forever. People will be denied acquisition moneys from this fund because, as I said in relation to the previous motion I put, the management component will eat into it in a very small amount of time. It really is denying justice to so many people in our country who have been dispossessed. We believe there is no way, unless the government is able to address this point, that anybody who cares about justice for Aboriginal people can support this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a case of lies, damned lies and Green statistics. This amendment is my proof for the assertion I made the other day that the Western Australian Greens are only visiting this planet. I have no doubt that the Greens would see the sense of this amendment, but I would like to point out the huge hole in Senator Chamarette's graph. It is a great big hole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the graph does not include the $1.5 billion recurrent per annum which is allocated by this government on behalf of the taxpayers of Australia, who provided it in the first place. It does not include that at all. But that is not the biggest hole in this graph. I will tell the chamber what the biggest hole is. The money that we are appropriating for the purchase of land is exclusively for the benefit of the Aboriginal people of Australia; that is, one per cent to 1 1/2 per cent, depending on the statistics we accept&mdash;I think that was the last figure I saw&mdash;of our total population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allocation for the defence of this nation, the allocation that Senator Chamarette has given such emphasis to in this graph, is a defence allocation that is made on behalf of us all; that is, all Australians&mdash;Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal. The foreign aid budget that Senator Chamarette has referred to in this graph is for foreign aid provided for the assistance of people overseas on behalf of us all. The Collins class submarine&mdash;so named, I might add, because of its shape&mdash;is provided, again, for the defence of us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big hole in Senator Chamarette's graph is that it totally ignores the fact that this fund is for the exclusive benefit of one small part of the Australian community, the Australian Aboriginal people. If we drew up a graph&mdash;and she might do us the courtesy of getting her Green statisticians to draw up one for us; it would be an interesting looking graph&mdash;which factored in the $1.5 billion of recurrent expenditure which is paid out by this government, happily, for the benefit of Aboriginal people, and we then converted this graph to a per capita graph, which is the only accurate way that we could portray this as a graph that indicates relative expenditure, it would be a very interesting looking graph indeed and one that would be substantially different from the one that Senator Chamarette has incorporated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad that Senator Chamarette has incorporated this graph because it indicates probably more effectively than anything I have heard in this debate so far&mdash;and I have followed it carefully from the time it started&mdash;just exactly where the Greens come from on this issue. Senator Chamarette gave three reasons why she picked on one per cent. I have dealt with the graph, but she gave two other reasons which the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> will indicate. First, it is quite a substantial amount&mdash;we cannot argue with that; and second, King George thought it was a good idea at the time. I do not think that either of the reasons Senator Chamarette put forward before she produced her graph is relevant to sensible debate or sensible economic management of this country, which we have a responsibility to carry out on behalf of all Australians. As I say, the graph is fundamentally flawed in its premise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette's figures are correct in terms of how much money would be available. The one per cent of Commonwealth revenues that this amendment calls for would provide a fund of $15 billion by the time the fund was completed. The figures that Senator Chamarette has given in terms of the draw down are correct. That would provide annual disbursements for the acquisition of land for the sole benefit of the Aboriginal people of Australia of around $450 million. Having been around the traps for a fair while and having seen how moneys are expended in Aboriginal communities, it would be an interesting exercise to see the ILC, or any other corporation, effectively, responsibly and beneficially spend $450 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a crazy amendment. I could not use words strong enough to describe how crazy it is. I emphasise this because I have been referred to statements made by the Greens that on an issue like this they are prepared to vote this bill down if they do not get it up. That is how fundamentally flawed our approach is as far as the Greens are concerned. The amount of money is so bad that the Greens would rather see no fund at all&mdash;these are the statements that have been made from time to time&mdash;than not see $450 million per year for land acquisition for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell the chamber of a couple of things would happen. First of all, there would be an extraordinary impact on the marketplace. When it is known that there is $450 to spend, I imagine prices would go through the roof in areas where Aboriginal people express an interest in property. It would be like that movie&mdash;I cannot remember the title&mdash;where the star has to spend $1 million a day for a month to inherit the rest. That is the kind of craziness that Senator Chamarette is contemplating. I am amazed that she has not sat down and thought that through. How could any Aboriginal organisation, with the best advisers in the world, responsibly acquire land at the rate of $450 million each and every year for the benefit of Aboriginal people? It is just a crazy proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would totally blow out the government's deficit reduction strategy. If it was taken out of the public account&mdash;the other proposition that is being supported as part of the Green's package&mdash;it would add about $1.5 billion a year to the deficit each and every year. In my view, it would simply be totally impractical to even think that the corporation could responsibly spend the sums that Senator Chamarette is talking about&mdash;$270 million if it was to remain in the public account, and $1.5 billion if it was taken out of the public account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another important issue that has to be put on the record; I have alluded to it once, but I will say it far more emphatically in the light of this amendment. The government has carefully considered the amount of money concerned. Senator Chamarette has provided her reasons as to why she determined that it should be one per cent: it is a substantial amount, King George thought it was a good idea, and this graph demonstrates why it should be paid out. The government's consideration was on a slightly different basis, and that was an amount which would substantially increase the current allocations, but at the same time could be contained within the government's responsible fiscal program&mdash;that is, managing a budget on behalf of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another factor, and I referred to it earlier in this debate. At the end of the day, we want this program to be supported by most Australians. That is vitally important, as part of the reconciliation process. I hope the Greens give that as much credence as we do. My view&mdash;and it is a strong view&mdash;is that this land fund will succeed in doing that. I have put that view in cabinet and outside of cabinet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feedback I have got in the discussions I have had with, for example, peak pastoral organisations in Australia, indicate that if it is responsibly managed there is a general willingness around the place to support these proposals. Obviously, a lot of the constituent members are not very happy about it, but most of the peak leadership I have spoken to in Australia are prepared to give this a real good go in a totally positive way. I have had meetings with senior representatives of some of the major pastoral groups in Australia that have offered their assistance in making at least the pastoral side of these acquisitions a success. They have provided suggestions to me, which I have happily accepted and will continue to work on, about how various business arrangements could be entered into which will ensure that not only the land is secured for Aboriginal people but also an income is successfully secured for them and that jobs are provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been heartened by that response. I could not think of anything more determined or more designed to blow that process out of the water than this amendment. I have no difficulty in saying that I am utterly confident that the amounts of money involved here would be comprehensively rejected by the majority of Australian people and be completely contrary to the aims of the government&mdash;that is, to provide a substantive amount of money that will provide a significant boost to the land acquisition programs that are currently in place; to be supported by the majority of Australians; to assist not only in the provision of justice for Aboriginal people but also in the reconciliation process; and, the bottom line being, to fit that within a responsible fiscal framework of management of the Australian budget on behalf of all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree almost entirely with what the minister has said in respect of this fund. The crucial point he makes is that we certainly need to have a broad consensus on these matters if we are going to achieve the sort of reconciliation we all want and overcome the disadvantages suffered by many Aboriginal people. The minister made good points about the effect on the property market. He made a good point about the backlash that this sort of funding proposal would create. We only need to see what happens when funny money enters a property market. Look at what happened during the asset price inflation of the late 1980s in the Australian capital city property markets, with hundreds of millions of dollars of funny money entering the property markets&mdash;and the Australian property market is still recovering from that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to Senator Chamarette in all earnestness and seriousness that the effect of the proposal&mdash;as far as funding goes, even though it is extremely well intentioned&mdash;would create a massive distortion in the property markets. We  are dealing with the pastoral property market, the agricultural property market or the property market in the capital cities or regional towns. We cannot pump hundreds of millions of dollars a year into those property markets without having a significant effect on them. The longer term social consequence would be to create a backlash and we would not carry the community with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC has been running a land acquisition function for a long time. There are examples of where ATSIC has bought properties. Strelley is the obvious example which comes to mind. We have seen reports on channel 7 and channel 10 of people going up to Strelley and looking at this disastrous mess. This sort of thing allows people who are opposed to the assistance of Aboriginals to say, `This is what stuffs up.' Senator Chamarette does not want that to happen; neither does Senator Collins nor I. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue&mdash;and I obviously cannot conclude this in 30 seconds, because it comes to one of the crucial points in this bill&mdash;is the point that Senator Collins made about the expertise and the achievement of the objectives for the fund. It would be impossible to find the administration required to invest hundreds of millions of dollars a year for the benefit of Aboriginal people; it could not be done practically. The Greens' objective is admirable. Senator Collins talks about only visiting this planet. We are all only visiting this planet.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="N26">Senator ABETZ</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Elements within the media in my home state of Tasmania have been attacking the state Liberal government for its initiative to construct a road linking Zeehan, a mining town on the west coast, with Smithton, a regional centre on the north-west coast of Tasmania. This link road will provide an important boost to the economies of the west coast and north-west coast of Tasmania. More importantly, it will provide a boost to the families and small businesses of those centres.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The west coast of Tasmania has been a vital part of Tasmania's infrastructure and economy. For in excess of a century it has been reliant on mining and fishing. In recent times, the tourist potential of the west coast has been recognised and appropriate developments are being undertaken. Indeed, some of my colleagues in this place had the benefit of visiting the north-west coast and west coast regions of Tasmania as part of a state wide tour of Liberal senators organised by my friend and colleague Senator Paul Calvert. I must say that Senator Calvert's organisational skills in organising that tour were nothing short of brilliant. Part of Senator Calvert's tour was a visit to the west coast. We accessed the west coast from Burnie through Ridgley after visiting North Forest's world class forestry research station. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This visit was no different to what a lot of tourists do: they proceed as far as Burnie and then they go to the west coast through Ridgley. Indeed, the national highway in Tasmania ends at Burnie. It is my view that it ought to be extended to the Circular Head region and the town of Smithton. The Circular Head area is a very productive area in Tasmania, specialising in the agricultural and forest industries. Unfortunately, its tourist potential has been stifled by the absence of a road linking it with the west coast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development of the link road between Circular Head and the west coast will provide a much needed boost to the families and businesses in both of those areas and, in particular, it will provide the opportunity for the development of tourist based establishments, thus providing a greater range and more employment opportunities to those Tasmanian communities. I noted with interest, when I mentioned this road earlier in my speech, that Senator Sherry sought to interject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at history. In 1983, the federal leader of the opposition, Mr Hawke, included this very road in a package of promises to justify stopping the damming of the Franklin River. It was clearly recognised over a decade ago by Senator Sherry's own party that such a road would be an important tourist link. Indeed, the Labor Party's failed candidate for Braddon in the 1983 election, Mr Lance Fee, said that the road would `mean a boost for tourism, both in Circular Head and on the west coast.' It also has the bipartisan support of the state Labor Party, so it is very interesting to listen to the comments of Senator Sherry. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expressions of support have come from a wide range of tourism operators and consultants, including some from the mainland. There is no doubt that this road will have great economic benefits for Circular Head and the west coast, and for Tasmania in general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This link road is an important initiative. It is exactly the type of infrastructure development in which government ought to be involved: providing those developments which are beyond the reach of private enterprise, to allow for an environment in which family businesses and jobs can prosper. The project has the support of both mainstream parties in Tasmania. It is only the Greens, representing less than 10 per cent of the population, who are opposed to the project. If one were to read the print media stories and commentaries from certain Tasmanian journalists, one would think the project had no support at all. My state of Tasmania has suffered sufficiently without elements in the media trying to scuttle every proposal to make Tasmania's economy that little bit more dynamic and self-sustaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now seek to turn to another matter which is of considerable concern in Tasmania. It is the proposal being peddled by the group know as Pedder 2000. Those who are suffering from drought around Australia know what a precious resource water is. Those who live in mainland states and suffer air pollution from the burning of fossil fuels for energy should know that the water generated power in Tasmania is providing a world standard for power generation. For Pedder 2000 to propose the draining of a huge and substantial water resource in times of severe drought and ever increasing concern over global warming shows a callous disregard for our nation's real requirements. The environment industry, funded by Labor to the tune of millions of dollars, has done enough harm to Tasmania. Over 35 per cent of our land mass has been locked away. The environment industry, not satisfied with slowing down Tasmania's progress, is now wanting to turn the clock back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lake Pedder has become an icon to the environment industry. It has some emotional `feel-good' qualities about it. As a teenager I walked in to see Lake Pedder before it was flooded. It took a day to walk in and a day to walk out through mud and button grass plains. The group I walked with was able to leave our car at the side of a road constructed by the Hydro-Electric Commission. Nowadays, the tourism potential is much greater, with fully made roads, a chalet, fishing, boating, walks and a host of activities. Whilst the environment industry promises thousands of tourists and economic benefits if Lake Pedder were to be drained, we in Tasmania have heard that promise before. We were told that if a certain section of the Franklin River were not dammed we would have a mass of tourists come and visit. Where are those tourists? I know one thing: they surely are not visiting the Franklin River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us never forget that the main advocate for turning the clock back on Pedder is none other than Bob Brown. The Bob Brown who tells the world that it is impossible for a clear-felled forest ever to regenerate itself is the same Bob Brown who tells the world that even after 20 years of being submerged under water, the land will regenerate itself in a matter of a few years. What is the special quality of drowning land under water for 20 years which allows for quicker regeneration than clear-felling a forest? Methinks there are no such special qualities. Rather, people in the environment industry are engaged in `doing a Richo' and telling untruths when and if it suits their cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there may be warm and fuzzy feelings to be had by draining Lake Pedder, the consequences of such an action need to be understood by the residents of all the other states of Australia. It is important to remember that about one-half of Australia's emissions of carbon dioxide, the major greenhouse gas, are produced by the energy sector, making mainland electricity authorities leading producers of greenhouse gases. Energy far outweighs the combined total of all other sources, such as industrial processes, agriculture, land use change, forestry and waste, as sources of greenhouse emissions. Tasmania, on the other hand, has the only fully integrated, all-hydro system in Australia, producing clean, renewable energy from our abundant natural fuel source, water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lake Pedder is a crucial storage for Tasmania. It is one of only three major storages which protect the state when low rainfall or drought reduces rainfall from the normal run of river components of our hydro system. Not only is it an outstanding scenic attraction in one of the most beautiful parts of Australia's most beautiful state, it is also a key contributor to the Tasmanian economy. Lake Pedder holds 242 square kilometres of water at normal full level, 308 metres above sea level. This is about a third of a billion cubic metres of water. Gordon and Lake Pedder storages combined constitute 31 per cent of the total system energy storage in Tasmania. Lake Pedder itself provides 40 per cent of the average flow to the Gordon Power Station, representing about 65 megawatt average output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since commissioning in 1978, the Gordon development has generated more than 18 million megawatt hours, worth about $850 million at current oil prices. Of this total, Lake Pedder has contributed 7.2 million megawatt of electricity worth $340 million. Without the new Lake Pedder, there would be a serious risk of quite high levels of rationing under continued dry conditions. As most of Australia now knows, prolonged droughts are unfortunately a reality. To drain away such a valuable asset would be grossly short-sighted and negligent if not criminal. If replaced by fossil fuel power, there would be an addition to carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere of about 0.5 million tonnes per annum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given those facts, it is surprising that Bob Brown and the Pedder 2000 lobby are incapable of a bit of global thinking. That is something that they always ask us to do&mdash;to think globally and act locally. That is exactly what we in Tasmania have done. What would be better for Australia and indeed the world? Is it to maintain the clean, green, renewable energy source or to deplete the source and add a further 0.5 million tonnes of greenhouse emissions into the air each year? My children and future generations would never forgive us if we allowed the environment industry and its cohorts to destroy this environmentally friendly asset because of some tortured ideological hang-up about Lake Pedder in the minds of a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the environment industry and those who are so anxious to see the draining of Lake Pedder that, rather than trying to destroy such a wonderful resource, they concentrate on the real and pressing environmental issues of the day: trying to find other energy sources which are capable of renewal which do not create the greenhouse emissions. I suggest that they concentrate their activities on the mainland rather than picking out the state of Tasmania all the time for their green-related agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Tasmania, and indeed Australia, have a wonderful resource in Lake Pedder. It ought to be protected because it combines all those qualities that we are continually told that we ought to achieve. It has the qualities of a tourist attraction, allowing people to gain access to wilderness areas and to enjoy the different rock formations, the different forest types, the different plains and to see the formation of the hills. At the same time, the new Lake Pedder development provides a much needed energy resource to the people of Australia without adding in any shape or form to the greenhouse gases which are now causing such a worldwide problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night in Brisbane a program entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Report</EMPHASIS> was screened on Channel 7. The program contained a number of serious allegations, outlining details of how the justice system in Queensland was used to prevent an allegedly corrupt senior police officer from being prosecuted. Indeed, the program alleged not only that the police officer who was the subject of the allegations was not prosecuted, but that the two policemen who tried to lay the charges were themselves subject to court proceedings, disciplinary action and punitive transfers. In short, they had their careers destroyed, while the senior police officer who was the subject of the allegations was able to retire from the police force with full benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program alleged that these events occurred with the knowledge of the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission, senior police and government ministers. It also detailed incidents of state government ministers allegedly misleading parliament. These are very serious matters indeed. I am so disappointed that it appears the CJC has failed to support and protect whistleblowers, with the possibility that it may even have worked together with some police to actively persecute them. I am so disappointed, after so much work by so many people, that there appears to be an overall lack of accountability on the part of the CJC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is naturally of great concern when such allegations are screened by a reputable journalist. I have known the particular journalist, Chris Adams, for many years. He is a person of high integrity. I have confidence in the work that Channel 7 did in putting together this program and I am aware that the program has been in the pipeline for many months because the channel checked, re-checked and re-checked the information which was given. Thus it can be seen why one needs to take seriously the allegations which were made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not intend to revisit the allegations in detail today. People can find these out for themselves if they wish to see the program. My concern is again a lack of government accountability. This caused so much damage in Queensland in previous decades and now it appears to be continuing unabated with the present state government. To some extent the issue is not whether or not these allegations are true, although that is obviously important, but the fact that they have been around for some time and have not been adequately answered or resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have always attached great importance to the issue of accountability. The operations of the state&mdash;government, police, and the courts&mdash;must be open and fair in order for public confidence in the system to be maintained. As a Queenslander, I am well aware of the terrible battering which public faith took during the process of the Fitzgerald inquiry. The Criminal Justice Commission was established out of the Fitzgerald inquiry to ensure accountability. The fact that allegations such as these have been made, which unfortunately touch on the competence and reliability of the CJC itself, is a matter of great concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report by the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing also expressed concern at the number of apparently unresolved whistleblower cases in Queensland. This concern was great enough for there to be a unanimous recommendation for an independent inquiry to be held. The case at the heart of last night's Channel 7 documentary is among those which caused such concern to the Senate committee, a committee containing members of the government, as well as the opposition and Senator Chamarette. Former policeman Gordon Harris has been to see me and I am thoroughly convinced of his integrity. There is no mileage in him continuing the allegations and continuing to seek justice. His life and his career have been ruined and yet he wants to see justice done. I have also put on the record on a number of occasions in the Senate the situation surrounding Kevin Lindeberg. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe accountability in government is fundamental to our democratic system. Everyone in Queensland had hopes that the CJC would be the vehicle for ensuring greater accountability in government in that state. It may be that we have had an unrealistic expectation in hoping that the CJC could achieve this on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As most senators would know, Queensland is the only state without an upper house. I do not think it is too self-congratulatory to suggest that the Senate plays a major role in ensuring at least some degree of accountability on the part of the federal parliament. It seems to me that reinstituting the upper house may be the only way to ensure some degree of accountability in my own state of Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter which is not only of public interest but I would suspect and hope is of considerable personal interest to senators and members of parliament.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This device conforms to CDRH radiation performance standards, 21CFR Chapter 1 Subchapter J.</PARA>
<PARA>It also complies with part 15 of the SCC rules. Intrigued by this, I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Human Services and Health (Senator Crowley), upon notice, on 20 June of this year, whether there was an Australian standard for electromagnetic radiation emissions and, if so, what it is, what it applies to, and how it is measured? Although the answer that I received was lengthy, it was neither comprehensive nor illuminating. In fact, while the information may be accurate&mdash;I have no reason to suspect that it would not be&mdash;it does not help us decipher what is on the side of those machines, nor does it give me the confidence that the machines and those many hundreds of thousands that are similar to them&mdash;the many consumer owned, electric and electronic devices which may be capable of emitting electromagnetic radiation&mdash;are properly tested and monitored. The minister responded in part:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told, however, in the answer that was given by the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important research is underway. The results from several major epidemiological studies are expected during the mid 1990s. A large animal tumour study being conducted through the Royal Adelaide Hospital should be completed during 1995. Magnetic field exposure studies have been conducted by ARL and NE.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not told what the results are, what is expected or what the progress is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that lack of information and because there is some community concern about this matter and there has been for some many years, I was interested when a proposal was put to me to conduct some research into this area. I am pleased today to be able to bring to the Senate comprehensive research which provides all the answers that are missing from the minister's answer. It is 40-odd pages long and is, I believe, of world standard in its depth and quality of research. It is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Non-ionizing electromagnetic fields and human health: are current standards "safe"?</EMPHASIS> It was prepared for me by Mr Don Maisch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to ensure that those who are interested in this topic have up-to-date information. This report is available and I am prepared to share it with any of those who are interested. I suggest that all senators and members who have a laser printer, a photocopier, a fax machine, a computer, a monitor and other devices for potential EMF emission should be interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason they should be interested is as follows. A video produced by the Department of Employment, Education and Training states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many international studies have been unable to demonstrate any link between birth defects or miscarriages and VDUs.</PARA>
<PARA>However, upon looking at some of the studies that do demonstrate that link, I think we should be alarmed. I will quote from some of them. At the beginning of 1982, on behalf of the British Civil Medical Advisory Service, Dr Bernard Lee conducted a study of 803 women at the Department of Employment in Runcorn, Cheshire. These women worked at least 10 hours a week with VDUs in the three months prior to and the three months after conception. The results of these women's pregnancies were compared with those of a small control group of women of the same age who were working in the same office complex but who were not regularly using VDUs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Lee found that over 43 per cent of the pregnancies in women who worked with VDUs ended unsuccessfully. Among VDU operators, of 55 pregnancies there were 14.5 per cent miscarriages, 6.7 per cent stillbirths and 22 per cent malformations. This compared with a 16 per cent adverse pregnancy outcome in the control group of 114 pregnancies. The conclusions say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this does not enable us to state that there is a relationship between VDU operation and these obstetric problems. These figures however indicate that there is more than a 95% chance of there being a connection between VDUs and miscarriage.</PARA>
<PARA>In a further study, Alison McDonald and her colleagues from the Institute of Research in Health and Safety of Workers, in Quebec, reviewed 104,620 pregnant women who were classified into 42 different occupational groups. For non-VDU users, the average rate of miscarriages was 5.7 per cent. The rate of miscarriages for VDU workers ranged from 8.2 to 45 per cent. The length of time each spent in the vicinity of a switched on VDU appeared to be an important factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to continue with a couple more examples. In May 1986, Ulf Bergqvist presented a paper at an international conference on work with VDUs in Sweden. The paper summarised reports from seven different international epidemiological studies on adverse pregnancy outcomes. Collectively, this involved 27,500 VDU workers. The average miscarriage rate of these VDU workers rose to 52 per cent compared with a 10 to 20 per cent miscarriage rate amongst the local population of non-VDU users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a Swedish study, 4,117 female clerks at social security bureaus were split into five groups ranging from those with no VDU exposure to those exposed to VDUs for a maximum of not more than 15 hours per week. This study concentrated on birth deformities in children. It does not include any details on the numbers of women who suffered miscarriages, nor does it include any details of stillbirths. However, group B, which comprised 412 women who used VDUs for not more than two hours a day, had a 100 per cent increase of significant birth malformations over the expected numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than read to the Senate the other results, which are quite detailed and significant figures, I will summarise them. Of the two groups, A and B, which used VDUs for a maximum of two or three hours daily respectively, the actual incidence of deformed babies was four times higher in group A, and 5 1/2 times higher in group B, than that of non-VDU users in the population as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the sort of information that is presented in this research paper. It has a series of recommendations including that we should not be complacent or apathetic about what is a serious risk to the health of ourselves, the people who work for us and the population at large. A very important part of that population is the considerable number&mdash;and it is increasing&mdash;of young Australians who are exposed to potential risks during their schooling because of the increased use of computers at school. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having introduced this to the Senate&mdash;I also invite people to obtain copies of it from my office&mdash;I intend to pursue this matter further. I will make this report available to public sector unions, to the Department of Employment, Education and Training and to the Department of Administrative Services. I think the most useful things that should result are that this research be considered seriously, that it be aligned with the research which the minister has told us about, and that we all re-assess the way in which we allow this machinery to be introduced into our offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, we should take a personal interest in whether there is a set of guidelines on the operation of the machinery we find in our offices. I will take it further than that. I will ask that the minister adopt the recommendations of this report or find reasons and detailed explanations as to why we in Australia should not establish new electromagnetic radiation exposure limits which are relevant to both residential and occupational standards. I will also ask that greater consideration be given to the risk of electromagnetic fields in medical research and patient treatment, and that it be mandatory that all computer monitors sold in Australia have a limit on radiation emission levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The labels that are on the side of the machinery in our offices, while being cryptic in one sense, are useless because we have no point of reference to decrypt whatever message is on the side. If there is an Australian limit, and if there are standards, it should be publicised widely and the meanings of the messages should be interpreted for potential users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important that we also consider another recommendation from this research report: that the monitors that are used in classroom situations should be at a lower level. We should take a precautionary attitude to the exposure of our children and we should pursue that with greater diligence. I think it is justifiable to do that because the long-term exposures are those which are potentially of greater harm and, of course, our children will be exposed to these over a greater period than we will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other recommendation I would have thought would already exist. This is the trouble. We assume things and we are always disappointed when we assume things; they never apply. I assumed that there would be a compulsory labelling scheme if we had standards but that is not so. I think there should be a compulsory scheme for labelling and informing consumers how these machines comply with whatever standards we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect of this piece of work is that, apart from it containing reports of international research, it also goes into a balanced and sensible discussion of the whole issue of how health is related to these potential risks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not in the chamber when the second reading debate went on, so I will make some comments now. It is appropriate in the view of the Democrats that the Commonwealth assist in the investigation of allegations of corruption in the New South Wales Police Service, so the Democrats welcome the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service (Access to Information) Bill. The bill is essentially a means of enabling the royal commission to access certain information held by AUSTRAC and a number of law enforcement agencies. It does this by amending two pieces of legislation: the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 2 has the effect of adding the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service to the FTR Act as a law enforcement agency so that the director of the cash tracing agency, AUSTRAC, may authorise the royal commission to have access to specified FTR information. Clause 6 includes the royal commission as an eligible authority for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. This allows relevant information lawfully collected under the act to be provided to the royal commission. Significantly, the bill does not allow the royal commission itself to seek the issue of warrants under the TI act, or to conduct interceptions itself. This would have required the classification of the royal commission as an `agency' rather than merely as an `eligible authority'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a good argument that the royal commission should have been given the power to conduct its own telecommunications intercepts. Indeed, the royal commissioner, Mr Justice Wood, argued that telephone interception has been made available to other investigative agencies such as the Independent Commission Against Corruption, the Queensland Justice Commission and all police services, and that it should have been extended to his royal commission. Mr Justice Wood also expressed the view that the arrangement whereby the NCA does the phone tapping and passes the information on to the royal commission `is not workable in practice or in principle'. The federal government's failure to take account of these matters raises serious questions about the effectiveness of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats considered introducing amendments to declare the royal commission an agency for the purposes of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. However, it was made clear to us that we would receive little support for this either from the government or from the opposition. We also considered, as an alternative, the possibility of including in the definition of class 2 offences the term `official corruption'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the advice we received, this may have enabled the National Crime Authority to inquire into matters of direct relevance to the royal commission, rather than being restricted to gathering information merely incidental to the work of the royal commission. However, advice from the Attorney-General's office suggested that, in order to gather information directly for the benefit of the royal commission, the National Crime Authority would need a specific reference and no indirect means of accessing information on behalf of the royal commission would suffice. Further, it was made clear to us that any amendments that had the effect of widening the scope of the bill would be rejected and this would hold up the passage of the bill. This would have effectively denied the royal commission access to the information already on the files of the National Crime Authority and other agencies and may have severely hampered the investigations of the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also understand that the New South Wales government has been advised that the Commonwealth government would facilitate and support an appropriate New South Wales government reference to the NCA of the matters in the royal commission terms of reference to enable the royal commission to obtain all the information it needs via NCA intercepts. The ball is therefore very much in the court of the New South Wales government and it is on this basis that the Democrats are agreeing to pass the bill in its present form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must also be admitted that the government's reasons for not wanting to increase the number of organisations that have the power to conduct telephone intercepts to yet another organisation carry considerable weight. The power to intercept telephone calls is arguably one of the most intrusive investigative powers available and it would appear that no royal commission in this country's history has ever been given powers to conduct its own intercepts. The view of the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr), and I understand the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) agrees, is that a precedent should not be established here. As I said, this view carries considerable weight. Yet the point remains that there have been sufficient allegations of corruption in the New South Wales Police Service to warrant the appointment of a royal commission and we must be completely confident that we have given it all the support it deserves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, while the Australian Democrats will not be moving any amendments to the bill, we wish to place on record our support for a review of the measures that this bill provides, at an appropriate time in the life of the royal commission, to ensure that the commission can effectively complete its tasks. As I said, the Australian Democrats support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A press statement issued by the association yesterday said the grant would be aimed at keeping the nation's core breeding stock and herds alive during the drought. The statement was issued following a survey conducted by the NFF that showed massive destocking operations had been under way and that the national core breeding herd of sheep and cattle was under threat. The statement contains absolutely no details of costs or how the scheme would work, apart from the fact that it should be done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question at all that the severe drought in Queensland and northern New South Wales is causing significant hardship for sheep and cattle producers.

I have made the point before that these figures are national figures and this association is talking about what is a national problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures indicate, as ABARE told me, the highly regionalised nature of the current drought in that the most severely impacted areas are in about 40 per cent of the state of Queensland and northern New South Wales. The latest figures that I was provided with by ABARE yesterday show that national cattle numbers&mdash;and these are assuming that the drought continues&mdash;are forecast to decline to 24 million head by March next year from around 24.6 million head in March this year. ABARE expects New South Wales cattle numbers to fall by around 450,000 head between March this year and March next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE forecasts a fall in the total Australian sheep numbers to around 130 million head by March next year, compared with 136 million head at March this year, which reflects reduced lamb markings and higher sheep slaughter.

For example, the current removal of mangroves from areas just adjacent to the proclaimed area and which are damaging the proclaimed area would be unlawful.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the current situation in the Gulf area, as is well known, Iraq has now withdrawn all its troops to their pre-crisis positions, and in that sense the immediate military threat to Kuwait is now over. I note that the United States has announced that it will begin to withdraw some of its forces from Kuwait from the end of this month. However, the US and the United Kingdom have warned Iraq that, should it attempt to reinforce its military capacities below the 32nd parallel, they will consider military action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US has also announced that it will continue to preposition military equipment in Kuwait, particularly `Warthog' anti-tank aircraft. The Australian government, of course, strongly supports UN Security Council Resolution 949 adopted on 15 October in response to the movement of troops by Iraq towards Kuwait. That condemned the recent military deployments, demanded that Iraq not threaten its neighbours or UN operations in Iraq, and demands that Iraq cooperate fully with UNSCOM, the UN Special Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the implications of the recent announcement by the Iraqi Parliament and the Revolutionary Command Council that it formally recognises Kuwait's sovereignty in the internationally demarcated border, our reaction is this: the announcement is certainly a step in the right direction and indicates, I hope, a realisation by Iraq that cooperation with the Security Council rather than threats of military action against Kuwait is the only way to achieve the lifting of sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the announcement is not enough in itself to warrant the lifting of sanctions, as the Security Council itself decided a couple of days ago on 14 November. Iraq still needs to fulfil all remaining aspects of the Security Council resolutions, including the return of missing Kuwaiti prisoners of war and Kuwaiti property stolen during the Gulf War and the payment of reparations for damage caused by the 1990 invasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Iraq must also maintain its cooperation with the UN Special Commission, the body charged with overseeing the identification, destruction and ongoing monitoring of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capacity. The lifting of sanctions has to be dependent on Iraqi compliance with all its obligations under UN Security Council resolutions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not specifically linked to the lifting of sanctions, Iraq must also comply with the UN Security Council resolution 688 of 5 April 1991 which demands that Iraq discontinues its repression of minorities, particularly the Shiites in the south of the country and the Kurds in the north. I repeat that the recognition by the Iraqi government is very welcome, certainly a step in the right direction, and we very much hope that Iraq will take the further remaining steps that are necessary to enable, in effect, its return in full to the international community.</PARA>

With respect to Mr Tarpley, I am informed that he was granted a tourist visa in Washington on 7 November 1994. He arrived in Australia on 11 November. With respect to him, I can say nothing more than that we expect people on tourist visas to undertake activities of a recreational nature. People undertaking political or promotional activities are normally expected to apply for other visas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that all personnel, including Australian nationals and their families, associated with Australian aid projects in East Timor are safe, although a Filipino employed by one of our projects was slightly injured in a disturbance at the Turismo Hotel on Sunday when rioters thought he was Indonesian. Fourteen Australian nationals in all&mdash;consultants and their family members&mdash;are currently living in Dili. They are associated with three projects: the East Timor water supply and sanitation project, the eastern islands veterinary services project and the regional planning project.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian embassy in Jakarta has maintained close and regular contact with the Australian project team leaders in Dili since the civil disturbances commenced on Saturday. Indeed, some of our on-the-spot information concerning the situation in Dili has come from them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision as to whether the aid personnel should stay or leave was left to the judgment of the project leaders, who are really in the best position to assess the risks. That remains the case. As a precautionary measure, though, some Australian project personnel and their families, including some deemed as possibly at risk given the ethnic nature of the violence to date&mdash;as they are either non-Timorese Indonesian or South-East Asian&mdash;elected to leave Dili until the situation improves. Three of them flew with their families to Kupang in West Timor yesterday and are staying with aid personnel there; another has gone with his wife to a conference in Bali.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aid personnel themselves who have gone to Kupang are planning to return to Dili tomorrow, but this, of course, will be subject to the security situation prevailing at the time. Other Australian personnel were either already out of the province or elected to stay. The personnel who remained in Dili have been staying in accommodation assessed as safe, but are taking normal precautions and staying away from potential trouble spots.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated in my answer to Senator Bourne on Monday, the origins of the current disturbances appear to have been predominantly ethnic tensions between East Timorese and Indonesians from other parts of the archipelago. There has been no identifiable anti-Australian feeling manifested in any of the disturbances to date. We will, of course, be continuing to monitor the situation closely and take any necessary steps to ensure the protection of Australian project personnel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should perhaps take a moment to bring the Senate up to date on the current overall situation in East Timor since my answer on Monday because there appear to have been two further significant demonstrations at the East Timor university&mdash;one on Monday and another one yesterday. In the first, up to 600 students clashed with security authorities after the authorities tried to detain some students on the campus. Yesterday, a smaller group of perhaps 300 pro-Fretilin students demonstrated at the university, but it appears that there were no clashes with the security forces on this occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no information which indicates that there were any serious injuries, let alone fatalities, at either of those demonstrations. Again, it must be said that the security forces do appear to have acted with restraint. As for the approximately 80 people arrested at disturbances over the weekend, I understand that the ICRC&mdash;the Red Cross&mdash;sought and was granted immediate access to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation in East Timor still appears to be volatile. We can all only hope that it will soon calm down; that the Indonesian authorities, in the meantime, will continue to show restraint. Similarly, might I add that I hope that no-one, including representatives of the international media allowed to visit the province, will do anything deliberately to provoke any further deterioration in the situation.</PARA>

It is true that my portfolio commissioned a report from Mr Peter Valentine into the issue of the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook Channel. As a result of that report being made available, certain conditions were placed upon the developer and the development, particularly in relation to the dredging of a channel through the seagrass beds, which was in fact in the World Heritage area, as the honourable senator would be aware.

What is more, the percentage CPI price rise forecasts in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> poll, which is one of the points that the interjectors have taken up, show Australia with average or below average inflation levels for 1994 and 1995.

<PARA>Senator Crowley gave me a non-answer to the question I asked about haemophilia. I referred specifically to haemophilia. That was in my question and, if Senator Crowley cares to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, she will see that that is what I asked. I should inform Senator Crowley that Factor VIII, which I referred to, is one of the proteins in the blood which enables blood to clot. People who have absent or reduced amounts of Factor VIII in their blood suffer from haemophilia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This condition results in spontaneous bleeding, often more than once a week, into muscles and joints causing chronic deformity. Haemophiliacs also bleed as a result of injury, surgery, teeth extraction or trauma. Treatment is given in the form of Factor VIII concentrate. Factor VIII is extracted from plasma collected by the Red Cross blood transfusion service either through whole blood donations or through specific plasmapheresis programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the health minister's meeting in June some acknowledgment was given towards recognising problems of recurrent shortages of Factor VIII in Australia. The matter was referred to the Australian Health Ministers Advisory Council working party to consider if and/or how additional amounts of Factor VIII could be supplied, distributed and funded. There appears to be tension between federal and state health departments regarding this funding. The paradox is that this working party will report to AHMAC in March next year. That was the minister's response. The Haemophilia Foundation today produced a booklet titled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Crisis Point in Treatment of Haemophilia in Australia</EMPHASIS>. There is a crisis today in the treatment of haemophilia in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my question I pointed out the delays that are occurring. I pointed out that in Melbourne yesterday 12 children had their preventive treatment stopped. This treatment, which involves being given an injection twice a week, is needed to stop bleeding in the joints&mdash;the knees, ankles and elbows. This will be an intolerable problem for them. The destruction of joints will occur unless they are given preventive treatment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the preventive treatment has stopped, because the government has done nothing about this. It has known of the problem since June this year. I asked a question in October. I gave the government notice three weeks ago, and nothing has occurred since. The minister has been approached and we have been given the same stonewalling, idiotic response. That response is not as idiotic as the one I was given today, because today's answer was just a farce. The minister read from a piece of paper that had no relationship at all to the question that I asked. I do not want to dwell on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a crisis in relation to haemophiliacs today&mdash;not December or next March. It is not a recurring problem. The minister said, `Oh, this is a problem that occurs every year.' It is a problem. It is an increasing problem because the number of blood donors has decreased in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister also said that we were up with world standards. We are up with the standards of Czechoslovakia and Poland, but not with those in England, the United States or Canada. The Haemophilia Foundation's information sheet says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason all people with haemophilia in Canada now have access to high purity factor VIII concentrates. All people in the United Kingdom with haemophilia and HIV are treated with high purity products.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, the minister did not understand the difference between recombinant factors and did not understand about monoclonal antibodies. It is alleged that she was a medical practitioner. She was a medical practitioner 20 or 30 years ago perhaps. I do not blame her for that; it is very difficult to keep up with the latest advances. But surely to heaven there is some medical practitioner in the department of health&mdash;even Dr Geraghty might have known, although he is out of touch, too&mdash;with some knowledge in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am speaking on behalf of the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia and on behalf of the 500 children around Australia affected by this program. It is no good saying, `We will report in March next year.' The damage to those children's joints will have occurred by then. Something has to be done and it has to be done urgently because this is a problem affecting more and more children. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As long ago as April, I raised this issue by writing to the minister and drawing to her attention the dreadful impact that this shortage was having on haemophiliacs. The matter had been drawn to my attention by constituents with two children suffering from this particular disease. But this shortage of blood products has been going on since before April and still nothing has been done. The shortage of this important clotting concentrate, Factor VIII, has been a national problem at least since that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore time that the government took some action. As I said, the Haemophilia Foundation, going back to early this year, was seeking some redress from the previous minister and subsequently sought attention from the current minister on this issue. Yet it is still being ignored. As Senator Herron said, without this very important Factor VIII synthetic treatment for haemophilia, children suffer extensively. They have a very painful life without it and there is the need for surgery and other difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now more than 12 months since the Haemophilia Foundation first raised this issue. In fact, it goes back to about September or October of last year. But still the problem goes on. Nothing has been done and nothing is being done, yet the government has responsibility for the people suffering in these particular circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a need for both an increase in funding and also, obviously, an increase in supply of the important Factor VIII clotting concentrate. The product is available from overseas sources, and yet there is no ready access to it in Australia as a direct consequence of this government's failure to recognise the problem and its consistent refusal, as I said, to respond to the requests of the Haemophilia Foundation on behalf of the 500 children to whom Senator Herron referred. As a result of this shortage, clinicians are being forced to use basic maintenance therapy, which is an inadequate treatment for this problem which so many children suffer. So again we find that children suffering from haemophilia are not able to lead a normal life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this product were made available to these children in the quantities required, they would be able, despite suffering from haemophilia, to lead a normal life. It is very similar, of course, to the treatment which sufferers from diabetes have readily available to them so that they are able to lead a normal life. The same situation applies to haemophiliacs with regard to Factor VIII. It is simply the shortage of this product which is restricting their capacity to lead a normal life, to which they are entitled.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that Senator Crowley, as the representative of the minister in this chamber, took this issue up and did not simply talk to the minister about it but demanded that the solution that is readily available be provided so that these children do not continue to suffer in the way that they have been suffering now for more than 12 months as a result of the neglect and the lack of care of this government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise one practical matter. The problem is very real and, as Senator Herron has said, it is a matter of crisis. A number of people, including myself and no doubt a number of other honourable senators and members, are blood donors, although in my case I regret to say that it has been rather intermittent over the last couple of years. From my experience there is not sufficient information provided by government authorities about the effect and the benefit to people of giving blood. My wife is also a blood donor and she indicates that there is no real information, even in the Red Cross centres, that is very visible about the benefit of the plasma program, which is of great importance to haemophiliacs.</PARA></TALK.START>

I raise that point for consideration by the government in support of Senator Herron's very real concerns, which I believe are shared in the chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), to questions without notice asked by Senators Reynolds, Kernot, Chamarette and Ian Macdonald this day, relating to Development at Port Hinchinbrook Island.</PARA>
<PARA>I have move this motion because this whole Oyster Point fiasco raises three very serious questions that really need to be addressed by this parliament. The first is the sovereignty of the state of Queensland, which has jurisdiction in relation to that development. That government&mdash;the Queensland Labor government, I might stress&mdash;looked into this project very seriously. It had environmental reports done, it made all the assessments on the issue and then it gave permission for this particular work to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What sort of message does this action of the federal government and this very inexperienced junior minister send to potential international investors in Australia? It says that they can plan, with proper authority and proper approvals, investments into major developments and then have another government and a very junior inexperienced minister come in over the top of a sovereign government and say, `All of that is finished; you must stop work.' That is a very serious question and a very serious problem for Australia as to what we are going to do with future investment in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue of major concern is employment. The area of Cardwell in the state electorate of Hinchinbrook has a very high rate of unemployment. The town of Cardwell for many years has languished. This development came along and is totally supported by the people of Cardwell. There have been public meetings there which have overwhelmingly supported that development. The people supported it because it provided jobs and it had been approved by the Queensland Labor government, not only on economic and building grounds but on environmental grounds as well. Because of all that, the people of Cardwell are entitled to think that this project was going to go ahead and much needed jobs were to be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the Democrats do not have much interest in jobs and I know that the Labor Party does not have much interest in jobs either; but it is a factor that should be taken into account, particularly when this project was approved by the Queensland Labor government as a building site&mdash;as a development&mdash;and on environmental grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third element that this chamber needs to consider is this: if perchance Senator Faulkner is at last right and if the removal of the mangroves is really going to cause untold and everlasting damage to the environment or to the World Heritage values, why has it taken him until the very last moment, when all the mangroves have been destroyed, as Senator Kernot pointed out, to take any action? If it is as serious as Senator Faulkner is now telling us it is, why did he not take some action when Professor Valentine reported on this in August? Why did the minister not take some action when he had the tripartite agreement, which he had for three months, which Mr Goss held up from signing for three weeks to allow Senator Faulkner to look at it, and which clearly said that these mangroves were to go? Why did Senator Faulkner not do something about it at that time? Why did he not do something about it when Mr Haig came to see him last week with all the evidence he no doubt had? Why did Senator Faulkner not act then while there were still some mangroves standing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems incredible to me that, if the matter is as serious as the minister now says it is, he did not do something about it when he had a chance to stop the mangroves being destroyed? I understand from press reports and from what Senator Kernot has said today that the mangroves were destroyed this morning at 3 o'clock. The whole lot of them are gone; they are absolutely finished. So it is great for Senator Faulkner to now put a stopper on this after they are all gone. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this shows the shallowness of Senator Faulkner and the Labor Party on this whole issue. It shows that they are prepared to grandstand for votes where it suits them. But if they had any real interest in the environment and if it is as much of a concern as Senator Faulkner now says it is, they would have done something before. On those three grounds, I think this is a very serious matter for the chamber. It is one that the Senate should take up with greater debate. Unfortunately, our program this week will not allow that, but it is something that we really need to address. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not often that I agree with Senator Ian Macdonald, but I agree that we should be debating this for longer than we have this afternoon. I wish I knew which side of the fence Senator Macdonald is sitting on. He seems to not be able to make up his mind whether he is against the clearance of the mangroves or whether he is pro development. He really does not have that clear in his own mind. This afternoon he interjected on the minister's answers, saying, `Why didn't you act?' Then, in the next breath, he talked about stopping development and the issue of jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three fundamental issues that the Senate should consider. First of all, the state government processes through the Office of the Coordinator-General were inadequate. As a Labor Party member, I am sorry that I have to say that but they were inadequate. Within the bureaucracy, the state coordinator-general's department did not appreciate the very sensitive nature of this development, and it was fast-tracked through without the necessary thought being given to the fact that the development abuts two unique World Heritage regions. That is most unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was never an environmental impact assessment. There was only an environmental review. People who do not know anything about environmental assessment processes have probably never heard of an environmental review. The first thing to acknowledge is that the coordinator-general's department did not get it right. However, Minister Molly Robson and Minister Faulkner have been working cooperatively for a number of months to try to retrieve what was not the best possible beginning to this project. I believe that both Minister Robson and Minister Faulkner have done their best to work cooperatively to try to ensure that the development would proceed and that an appropriate scale down of the project would ensure that World Heritage values were protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point relates to the question of jobs. There is no reason why ongoing jobs will not be generated by this project, but this project has to be consistent with World Heritage values. Work does not have to stop this afternoon or tomorrow morning. Jobs do not have to be lost. But it is appropriate for this unique region that the development be scaled down accordingly and that certain features of Keith Williams's development&mdash;for instance, the beach, the marina&mdash;which we are told by scientists will have dramatic impacts on the unique value of the seagrass beds and endangered species, will not go ahead as he has planned. I have to say this: one really has to doubt the credibility of any ecotourism developer who would take in the bulldozers at midnight and not finish until 3 a.m., when forced to do so by legal action. Finally, over 70 scientists have written an open letter on this subject. I seek permission to table that letter. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My responsibilities go to the protection of World Heritage values, and it is incumbent on me to take action to protect those values where and when I think appropriate. The Valentine report drew attention to the potential impact of the development on World Heritage values but, as I said in question time, it also drew attention to the fact that there is a lack of information in relation to those impacts. That report recommended that baseline studies take place. The Queensland government agreed to a series of baseline studies, and the first of those studies was conducted by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries on seagrasses. The results of that study have only recently been made available to us and they establish for the first time that seagrasses are present in the area adjacent to the development&mdash;including one particularly rare variety. That in itself is significant new information but, in addition to that, other independent advice has been made available to the department since the Valentine report was presented to my portfolio. </PARA>

This drug for the treatment of osteoporosis is priced at $16.20 for women and $104 for men. It is about time the government took this whole issue back to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee to have it look at this issue again.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important factor is that the rate of osteoporosis among men over 50 is between eight and 10 per cent.

Osteoporosis, as most would know, is caused by a bone loss, leading to an increased risk of fracture. Up to 60 per cent of Australian women and 30 per cent of men over the age of 60 will suffer from that type of fracture. So we are not talking about a small number of people, we are talking about a significant number of men who are affected by this disease.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to facilitate the trading of new and innovative products on Australian securities and futures exchanges. It will permit the trading of new products on a more flexible basis than is presently possible under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The substance of these amendments was originally included in the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill which was introduced into the House of Representatives on 24 March 1994. Those amendments were intended to facilitate the trading of a new product by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) from 1 July 1994. The amendments were withdrawan from that bill to allow for further public comment on the proposals and to permit exposure of draft regulations and business rules in support of the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An exposure package of documents was released on 5 September 1994 for public comment by interested parties. The exposure package included the draft bill and regulations, draft explanatory memoranda and a summary of the share ratio business rules prepared by the ASX. Overall, there has been a favourable response to the proposals. In particular, the Australian Securities Commission, the Law Council of Australia, the Securities Institute of Australia and the International Banks and Securities Association support the proposals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Government policy to assist the Australian securities and futures industries to grow and develop. These industries play an integral and important role in Australia's financial markets. They are vital to Australia's future as a mature and stable economy. Through these industries Australia can develop as an important financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region. The ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) hold key positions in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the commencement of the national scheme for corporate regulation on 1 January 1991 the Government has endeavoured to facilitate competition in, and promote the international competitiveness of, Australia's securities and futures markets. Through legislative change and the administration of the law by the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) our markets have been encouraged, not stifled, by regulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amongst other initiatives the Government has facilitated the introduction of an electronic clearing facility to enable the ASX to meet best international practice standards in the clearance and settlement of share transactions. Legislation has been enacted to facilitate the establishment of retail screen based trading markets for collective investment schemes. This will provide a new market for investors to trade units in collective investment schemes. The Government has also approved the New Zealand Futures &amp; Options Exchange, a subsidiary of the SFE, trading its products on a screen based system in Australia. It is important to appreciate that the general policy thrust of this bill is a continuation of this policy of encouraging competition in the financial markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that the future success of the exchanges depends in part on their capacity to develop and market innovative new products in response to changing financial needs and circumstances. Both the ASX and the SFE have shown that they have the capacity to develop such products. It is important that this activity not be frustrated by regulatory structures which inhibit product development or encourage business to go elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Corporations Law trading in futures contracts and securities is separately regulated. Generally speaking, under the current law futures contracts are only able to be traded on a futures exchange while securities are ordinarily traded on a stock exchange. Strict penalties apply if securities or futures contracts are traded in breach of the Law. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present rigid definitions of "securities" and "futures contracts" in the Corporations Law can operate to prevent the trading of new products on a particular exchange, in circumstances where there may be valid reasons why they should be able to be traded on that exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those definitions were developed some time ago. There has been significant growth in derivatives markets and development of new financial instruments and products since that time. These developments were not contemplated when the basic legislation was first formulated. For some of these products, the existing regulatory provisions are not the most appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has therefore decided to amend the Corporations Law to introduce greater flexibility into the definitions of "securities" and "futures contracts" in the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Share Ratio Contracts</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The catalyst for the introduction of these reforms at this time is the new product, termed a share ratio contract, recently developed by the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A share ratio contract is a derivative financial instrument. It combines the features of a security and a futures contract.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASX is presently precluded from trading this product on its securities exchange because a share ratio contract does not fall within the existing definition of securities. However, there is a close relationship between a share ratio contract and securities which are already traded by stock brokers on the ASX. Share ratio contracts require a knowledge of the performance of individual shares. Stock brokers will be equipped to provide advice about such contracts. They will be required to demonstrate that they have relevant experience and education and have completed a training program conducted by the ASX in relation to advising and dealing in share ratio contracts. All share ratio trading will be supervised by a senior representative of ASX member organisations. In light of these arrangements the Government is of the view, therefore, that in this particular case and, in the context of the regulatory arrangements being developed, it is reasonable for share ratio contracts to be traded on a securities exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the bill will amend the definitions of "securities" and "futures contracts" by permitting certain "exchange traded" agreements to be prescribed by regulation as securities or futures contracts. The first such agreements to be prescribed, share ratio contracts, will be prescribed as securities, enabling the ASX to trade its new product on its securities exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also permit the prescription of other products in the future, thus ensuring a quick legislative response to developments in derivatives markets and the emergence of new products by enabling those products to be approved for trading on stock exchanges or futures exchanges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to prescribe products will be used sparingly. Nor will these amendments have any application to mainstream products which fail to be regulated under the respective regimes already in place. These will continue to be governed by the existing regulatory regime prescribed in the Corporations Law for securities and futures contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, to ensure that appropriate regulatory standards apply to share ratio contracts and other products that may be prescribed, the bill provides that regulations may modify the application of the Corporations Law to such products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will enable the regulations to selectively apply the most appropriate provisions of the Corporations Law to the products to ensure that a suitable regulatory regime is in place for their trading and that investors are adequately protected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exposure package for this bill illustrates how this is to be achieved. The draft regulations in that package prescribe share ratio contracts for the purposes of the Corporations Law, and modify the provisions of the Law as they apply to such contracts. The essential features of a regulatory scheme for the trading of share ratio products will include: the licensing of dealers, the conduct of dealers' businesses, dealers' accounts and audit, the handling of client moneys, fraud and market manipulation and fidelity fund arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Guarantee Fund (NGF) will guarantee share ratio contracts traded on the ASX. I am advised by the ASC that an independent actuarial study has confirmed that the resources of the NGF are sufficient to meet any reasonable foreseeable claims arising from trading in share ratio contracts. The ASC has stated that the report confirms that any potential losses from the trading of share ratio contracts would not undermine the financial resources of the Fund. In addition, those provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with investor protection and the maintenance of fair, competitive and orderly futures markets will be part of the regime applying to share ratio contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other rules governing the trading of share ratio contracts will be set out in the business rules of the ASX. Those rules have been comprehensively reviewed by the ASC in order to ensure that the standards applicable to the trading of risk management products are adhered to. Those rules are subject to disallowance by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the Counter Derivatives Markets</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I reiterate the comments I made during the course of the debate on the Corporations Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, that the Government does not intend to regulate over-the-counter derivatives markets under these amendments. The power to prescribe agreements, contained in this bill, is limited to agreements traded on an exchange. This bill has nothing to say about the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Review of derivatives</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is presently undertaking a review of the regulation of derivatives. It is expected that this review will also address the policy issue of the trading of derivatives on securities and futures exchanges. However, this review process will take some time to complete. Any amendments to the Law arising from it may be some time away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will assist the development and trading of new derivative products in the interim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial markets and the needs of their users are evolving in ways that were not envisaged during the 1980s. New and innovative products continue to be developed and traded by derivatives markets. Provided adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors and the integrity of financial markets, the Government must be able to respond to requests by exchanges to trade new products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I have noted, the Government has encouraged our securities and futures markets to compete in global markets. It has sought to facilitate the exchanges by modifying the Law to make the regulatory framework responsive, flexible and adaptable while, at the same time, not reducing investor protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The share ratio product has been welcomed by local institutional investors and it is anticipated that it will gain acceptance in overseas markets, thus considerably enhancing the international reputation of Australia's securities markets. This bill provides a mechanism for facilitating the development, not only of this particular product, but other new financial products in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Financial impact</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is not expected to have any significant financial impact on Government or business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with the Heads of Agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory on corporate regulation the Ministerial Council on Corporations has been consulted on the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the ANL Guarantee Bill 1994 is to ensure that ANL is able to continue to trade in an orderly fashion, especially during the restructuring process in which the company is currently involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 22 August 1994, immediately following the receipt of a due diligence report on ANL which revealed the company was in a difficult financial and trading position, the Minister for Transport announced measures designed to restructure the company and provide it with the opportunity for a viable commercial future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the measures taken was the appointment of a new Board with the specialised skills necessary to undertake the reconstruction task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another important measure was the announcement, which the Treasurer confirmed in writing to ANL, that the government intended to guarantee all existing debts of the company and any further draw-downs required on its promissory note facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was recognised as critical to the reconstruction exercise and the company's ongoing operations that ANL's financiers could have complete confidence that their dealings with the company were secure and that the company's operational lines of credit should be maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation achieves these objectives by providing the Treasurer with the power, required to satisfy section 70B of the Audit Act 1901, to make determinations guaranteeing payments in respect of loans to ANL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the announcement of the Minister for Transport, it is envisaged that the exercise of these powers would be limited to guaranteeing ANL's existing debt and promissory note facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the legislation does not specifically address the issue of loans to ANL from international financiers, it is intended that this legislation should also enable the provision of guarantees in respect of any such loans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am confident that, in underpinning the restructuring process now under way, this legislation will assist ANL to become a viable, commercial operation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government appreciates the important contribution an efficient and competitive ANL, and Australian shipping industry as a whole, can make to the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this respect ANL will be particularly well placed to benefit from initiatives being explored by the government and the maritime unions to improve the competitiveness of Australian shipping by reducing costs and improving efficiency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In taking such action the government is continuing to build upon the very successful program of consensus reform that has occurred since the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government remains committed to the development of a competitive and viable Australian shipping industry operating safe and efficient ships under the Australian flag with Australian crews and Australian award conditions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this debate was last before us we were speaking about the Greens' amendment to increase the amount of money in the land fund to one per cent of total government revenue. Senator Chamarette gave a rationale based on two major points. She gave her version of a government rationale based on three points and concluded that, if we did not vote for this amendment, then we would write out forever the capacity for justice for dispossession for indigenous people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard both the government and the opposition say that, in their view, such a request would impact on the deficit and on the deficit reduction strategy, and that there would be an effect on the property market. I agree with Senator Chamarette that the money is not sufficient. I do not agree with previous speakers that carrying the community with them on such decisions is one of the most important reasons to justify voting or not voting for a particular amendment. But I have heard the opposition talk at length in this place about government budget legislation and the role of oppositions and other parties with respect to the changes we should make to that. I agree with some of those comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the long run we come down to the fundamental question, which has been raised here before, of whether this is worse than nothing. It is not worse than nothing, in my view. It is something which is not adequate&mdash;and probably never can be&mdash;but it deserves support. We need to consider that if we were not to support this, if we were to say, `Vote against it because it is worse than nothing,' we would be saying goodbye to a 10-year appropriation that is locked in. If we were to force this amendment on the committee, the government would walk away from it and we would loose the opportunity for a 10-year appropriation to be locked in. I think that is something we should consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I hear the rationale and I regret that in this country we do not have the proper dialogue about how we ought to raise revenue so that more money could be available for legislation like this, and while ever we have a government and an opposition locked into the lowest common denominator approach of never addressing the question of revenue raising in this country, then it seems the political reality&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 3 1/2 minutes before lunch, I did not mention the effect on the deficit. Of course, that is an important matter that does affect the wellbeing of all Australians. As to the effect on the property market, I do not think that either Senator Collins or I would want to be misrepresented by someone saying that we think that some sort of adverse effect on the property market is an economically rational way of saying why we should not spend more money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the effect on the property market is that it actually adversely affects the people for whom one is trying to buy land. If one bids up the price of pastoral leases or any other property all around the country and any property vendor or property agent gets a sniff that a few hundred million dollars are about to turn up on the doorstep, all of a sudden the prices will go through the roof. So one does need to bear that in mind, not because one is a hard-nosed economic rationalist but because one actually is humanitarian and caring about how one intervenes on behalf of people in a market that is effectively a rational one. And I think Senator Collins and I are both 100 per cent in agreement on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Kernot is right on the backlash question. One has to understand that, unless these sorts of programs are administered properly, run effectively and achieve the objectives that I think just about all Australians would share for them, then one will get a backlash which will be counterproductive to the overall objective&mdash;and that is a matter of serious concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One can. I think Senator Kernot is right, to the extent that it is probably impossible to overcome the problem of dispossession by using money. I think Senator Chamarette is genuinely trying to say, `Look, it is a big problem and we need big amounts of dollars to try to make a better fist of it.' But the coalition's view on this&mdash;and I have said it a couple of times&mdash;is that we have never philosophically opposed a land fund; we never philosophically opposed land acquisition within ATSIC. Senator Panizza and lots of others draw attention to maladministration and so forth, which is the proper thing to do. I do not think Senator Collins would disagree with senators of any party raising concerns about maladministration in those sorts of programs, because in the end they do assist the programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concluded just before lunch talking about the observation that we are `only visiting this planet'. The reality is that all of us are only visiting this planet, and no matter how we are painted in the media or painted in our parties as being right, left or centre, there is amongst those who focus on Aboriginal affairs, regardless of their perspective, a genuine concern to do something constructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all have different perspectives of how to do that. I think anyone who reflects on others' motives in that regard is not really being fair to the overall cause. I believe that the Greens' proposals in relation to funding would adversely affect the cause. With regard to whether a resolution of the issues that have been in conflict in this debate can be achieved, we have had some resolution of a number of the amendments. We have had government support for a number of the coalition amendments, which we welcome. We realise it cannot live with a number of the amendments but we have done our best to inform the parliament and the people of the reason for those amendments. The reality is that this bill can make a difference. It can achieve some of its objectives. In that respect, I hope we will have achieved something through this lengthy debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the amendment that is before the chamber at the moment, there is no doubt that more money may be of more assistance and that the point that the Greens are making is an important one. But I think the radical nature of the funding proposal that they have put before the chamber at the moment would actually be counterproductive. The good thing about this bill, as amended, if it can work its way into legislation at some stage in the next few months&mdash;obviously subject to a lot more work&mdash;is that it will make a difference. It will be better than what Aboriginal people have at the moment. I recommend that it be supported on that basis. To do it in this way would be very counterproductive in all of those areas that Senator Collins mentioned and that I have supported. If you do not carry the community with you, it just will not work, and it is very vital to do that. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the hyperbole and the criticisms. The reason why I did not compare it with the ATSIC budget when I was indicating that the scale of the land fund over 10 years was nowhere near the $1 billion expended on Parliament House was that there has been quite a clear differentiation all along by the government and the Democrats that citizens' rights, health, housing, et cetera, which are covered by ATSIC are in no way comparable to a land fund. Believe me, the amount is in no way comparable, either. What ATSIC gets in one year, the land fund will not get in even 10 years in terms of the amount that is actually distributed. The amount that is actually expropriated from the so-called $1 billion fund will only ever amount to a maximum of $450 million, and that is after a period of 10 years. So there is no comparison.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point made by Senator Collins was that the defence budget which, as we pointed out, in one year gives what the Greens' amendment would give in 10 years, is for all Australians. Similarly, Senator Collins said that the foreign aid that we give each year, which is $1.4 billion, is for all Australians to give to people overseas about whom we have concerns in relation to their human rights and for other assistance. That, again, is for all Australians. Of course, a Collins class submarine is for all Australians. May I say that reconciliation is for all Australians. Any genuine attempt to redress the injustice of 200 years is for all Australians. I believe there are many people in the community who feel that it is perfectly appropriate and for all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take offence to the monotonous repetition of `exclusive benefit of one small part of Australia', meaning Aboriginal people, because `exclusive benefit' for a start implies that the money that is actually going to be given is going to Aboriginal people. Well, it is not; the land is. The money is going to non-Aboriginal people&mdash;to taxpayers and people whose properties are purchased. The money that is being given, which is what the government is begrudging, is money that goes straight to non-Aboriginal people&mdash;not to Aboriginal people&mdash;to compensate them for the purchase, at market values, of their properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I object to the phrase `exclusive benefit'. I also object to the use of the term `one small part of Australia'. With regard to the use of the term `exclusive benefit of one small part of Australia', it is only the indigenous people of Australia to whom we are referring, only the owners of this country, whose land was taken without any recompense, without any money being given to them. Therefore, we must be very careful about our language because we might give the lie, which I think is there in ample evidence in other parts of the legislation, to the purpose which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had intended for this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Senator Collins's concern that we are talking about a per capita grant, I say to him that it is very clear from the details that we gave in our statements that because there are approximately&mdash;and this is a very underestimated census, I believe&mdash;265,459 people of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, according to the last census, this means they represent 1.6 per cent of the total population. What we are planning to give them is one per cent of the total government revenue which has been earned by the benefits that we have derived from their land. I could refer to a quote which illustrates how much we should be grateful for what this land has given us. The one per cent figure represents simply some kind of token rent to those people who have survived the ravages of what colonisation has done to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins tried to promote the idea that the Greens were being a bit petulant about this&mdash;that if we do not get this, we will vote the bill down. I did not say that. What I said was that the bill is a disgrace and it does not deserve support. </PARA>

We want to see a test of the government's credibility&mdash;whether it is willing to raise it one iota from the point it is currently at. If it remains in its current form, as we have said all along, it is insupportable. If the government is prepared to make changes, that would be its own credibility being demonstrated. It is not that the Greens believe we could get it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the minister said that people are prepared to give it a really good go, especially the pastoralists, and that everybody is willing to support this bill; however, this amendment, if passed, would blow it out and it would not have support. I think it is because it is so negligible that it is very difficult for anybody to object. I do not agree with Senator Kernot when she said that it is not adequate but it is better than nothing. As I have said, I believe it is worse than nothing. I think that to have 10 years locked into a pittance is worse than nothing and that it is, for Aboriginal people, a matter of saying goodbye to any chance of really looking at their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now switch to Senator Campbell's comments. He was concerned and will not support the Greens' amendments for reasons similar to those of Senator Collins: the effect on the property market, the impact that funny money might have and the distortion that occurs in property markets. While he disagreed with what I will say next, I actually think those arguments serve to prove that economics in this instance is more important than justice. He expressed that that was not his view; nevertheless, I think we have to be very careful. If the major reason we cannot increase the amount is the effect it will have on the property markets, then I think we are saying economics is more important than justice. He is also saying there will be a backlash&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, I know, but it may actually allow more Aboriginal people to gain properties than currently do, unless Senator Campbell is postulating that the inflationary effect will entirely cancel out any increase of the distribution of those funds. If we have so much expertise that is so good at predicting how it will boost the property market, surely we have sufficient expertise to get around it as well. Why can we not? Why do we have such a concern about $250 million a year being released onto the market? There must be ways of dealing with that, apart from giving almost nothing to Aboriginal people. That is the extent of the amendment that the Greens propose&mdash;an extra $250 million a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a discussion I had with Mr Geoff Clark from Victoria, he talked about the amount of the fund. Every single Aboriginal group that has been talked to about this admits that this money will go nowhere across the whole of Australia. When I talked about the per capita numbers of people in Australia, I did not mention that. But if we actually divide up the amount that is currently under this legislation, it means $124 per Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander person. If we multiplied that by ten times, we would be giving them $1,000 a year for ten years. For goodness sake, how is that going to impact in any way on meeting their land needs?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought what Geoff Clark said was quite important because he had an alternative rationale to that of the Greens. We were going from the one per cent figure of the constitution of Western Australia, but Geoff Clark was going simply from his own community. He said, `Look, we've been thinking about how our community could get some kind of restoration of connection with land of some sort, some kind of economic base. We've worked out the minimum we could use is $2 million. We've also worked out that there's approximately 2,000 communities like ours around Australia.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the government not worked out how many communities there are&mdash;how many people it is thought do not have any land or any connection with land? Why has the government not worked it out on a smaller unit that would not necessarily scare the property market whatsoever? It would simply be giving autonomy to local communities and giving them the land fund in their hand instead of waving it around and pretending they are going to get it. It is a bit like drought relief and some other measures&mdash;it never gets into their hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money is not the issue; land is the issue. The reason we are raising the amendment about the quantity of money is in order to restore the land in some kind of meaningful way to the number of people who have been dispossessed. We have to tackle the restoration of land if we are going to meaningfully work for the restoration of justice for the indigenous people of this country, and we have to work meaningfully for the restoration of justice before we can talk reconciliation. We have to be able to share. We cannot just have empty words and legislation if we are going to talk about reconciliation following it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government needs to stop pretending and start telling the truth, which is, `(a) we can't afford it; (b) we don't want to blow out the deficit, or; (c) if we give too much all at once, or if we give anything significant, it will blow out the property markets and won't benefit the people we intend it for.' The government can start telling the truth and say it is just going to double the ATSIC current allocation instead of setting up a $3 million dollar bureaucracy, increase the money or give the land back and keep the money. The latter option is my favourite position, which is the position put by Clarrie Issacs. He said, `Christabel, don't worry about the money. We don't want the money. Aboriginal people don't want the money. We want the land. Just give us back our land and use the money in the land fund to pay the people who you take the land from.' Now how would we get a backlash?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the non-Aboriginal people in Australia knew that all they were going to get each year to recompense them for Aboriginal people getting back their legitimate land was $24 million extra a year, what an outcry we would have. I think that is the real message. If this government has any sincerity at all, it should be talking about land and restoration of culture to Aboriginal people. The government should give them their land; use whatever money it is prepared to put aside to that to recompense the people who may be using that land, or who might be inconvenienced by them regaining their land; and legislate to give back their land&mdash;any crown land that is vacant. If the government has any sincerity at all, it should give it back, increase the money or stop pretending to Aboriginal people that this land fund will provide anything but a pittance to a few people who are the first cabs off the rank. </PARA>

<PARA>This set of amendments is another series which is, again, simply a test of credibility for this government. It is an alternative `A' series, which relates to separate appropriation for the administration cost of the ILC. These amendments provide for a separate appropriation of funds to be used by the ILC for administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments do several things. Firstly, they provide for a separate appropriation of money to pay for the administration costs of the ILC so that it is effectively quarantined from the moneys available for land acquisition and management. Secondly, in so doing, the amendments define the types of administrative functions which are to be paid for by this appropriation, and that is a way of quarantining the costs of the administrative appropriation. Finally, the amendments make a request for the House of Representatives to vary the appropriation under clause 193 for an additional $3 million a year to pay for the administration costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for such amendments is obvious. If passed, the amendments will place a cap on the amount of money soaked up by the administrative costs of the Indigenous Land Corporation. The appropriation clause holds the government to its rhetoric that the money being made available is for the land fund and not for a duplicate bureaucracy, as Senator Campbell pointed out so clearly and forcefully earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) see that by proposing the amendments we are giving the parliament, particularly the government, the opportunity to show some degree of latitude over the funds being made available. By moving them, we are not walking away from our commitment to see a substantial increase in funds for a land acquisition fund. We are merely giving the parliament an opportunity to show a small degree of goodwill towards Australia's indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already pointed out in our other amendment, where we tried to quarantine the amount of management funds that would be eating into this overall fund, that there would be some remaining acquisition funds to people after all the management needs of indigenous held country is dealt with. This is merely a way to prevent what Senator Campbell pointed out at the time we circulated the graph, which showed the diminishing amount of acquisition money with the administrative costs staying constant. He actually said that he thought there could well be an increase in the administrative costs. This is a way of guaranteeing there is not. This is a way of guaranteeing that at least what is eaten into of the acquisition amount of this fund of approximately $21 million this year is not going to be at the expense of the acquisition and to the benefit of the administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the purpose of these amendments. I would urge all honourable senators who agreed with me that the amount of money is too small but who have also said that they do not think it is avoidable that this is one way of avoiding a minimal part of that eating into the acquisition capacity of the funds. At least in their first year they will be eaten into by the management component forever after, but we should quarantine off from it the administrative costs of setting up this new duplicate bureaucracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again, nothing could demonstrate more the completely contradictory approach that the Greens are taking to this legislation. The Greens have been insisting throughout this debate that they want the ILC freed as much as possible from government interference. Yet this amendment says quite up front, `We cannot allow the ILC to have the same control over its administrative expenses as any other organisation. Through the parliament we will impose a completely artificial restriction on the ILC by legislating for a maximum amount of money to be spent on administration.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ILC has to account to parliament. The amount of money it spends on its administration is open to criticism from all. I can say from personal experience that nobody will be quicker to criticise any indigenous organisation that spends more money on administration than it should and not enough on the ground than the constituents of that organisation&mdash;the Aboriginal people themselves; they are very good at it. We only have to look at ATSIC to see the effective way in which Aboriginal organisations can manage their administration. ATSIC has a record comparable with any other organisation of a similar size in having reasonable constraints on its administrative costs. The runs are on the board. Why do the Greens want to legislate for parliament, with this blunt measure, to determine the administrative responsibilities of this organisation? It completely contradicts everything else that they have said in this debate&mdash;not that that is news, as far as the Greens are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette has said consistently that she wants to free this organisation from government control. Now she wants to legislate to say that it cannot spend more than $3 million. I ask Senator Chamarette what else she has been saying it is vitally important for this organisation to do? The answer is: consult. I can tell Senator Chamarette that one of the single most expensive administrative costs for Aboriginal organisations is consultation. In pulling together one meeting of the Northern Land Council, charter costs alone are between $80,000 and $100,000. It is a very expensive business, flying around consulting people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette has moved and supported amendments to this legislation to `give priority to the most severely dispossessed people'. How can that be done without determining in the first instance who those people are? That can be done only through extensive consultation. There are already enough arguments in the Northern Territory over who the traditional owners are&mdash;who should be on the list and who should not&mdash;and those disputes, which have been running for years now, can only be properly addressed, as they are being addressed by the land councils, through extensive consultation. That consultation costs money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette has also said that this bill needs to have regard to health, housing et cetera and that the ILC has to consult traditional owners before acquiring land. Through the amendments she has proposed, Senator Chamarette is imposing very significant additional consultation requirements on this organisation which, as I know from personal experience, will be horrendously expensive to implement because of the degree of consultation that has to take place. Of course, the Greens have a fundamental position: if they can find one Aboriginal person who has not been consulted, we have to go back and do the whole thing again. At the same time, they want to shackle the organisation by putting a completely unreal legislative bar on the amount of money that can be spent. This is an absolute nonsense and the government will not be supporting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that this organisation, like ATSIC&mdash;which, I have to say, has a commendable record on administrative expenses&mdash;should be exposed to the same scrutiny as any other organisation. It should be prudent in its administration, which I have no doubt it will be. It should have to account for how much it has spent, put that up in lights and then have people either commend it or attack it for the level of expenses that it allows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that nobody will be more rigorous in imposing control on this organisation than the people who get maximum benefit out of having most of the money spent on the ground&mdash;the Aboriginal people of Australia. They will be far more severe critics of that organisation if it goes overboard with administration than this parliament could ever possibly be. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Page 42 of the ATSIC annual report shows that land acquisition expenditure for the year of the report was $17.229 million. The total cost of the land acquisition program, which includes some commercial assistance, was $38 million. Of that amount, $2.4 million was for running costs. So I assume that the administrative expenses for the land acquisition programs of ATSIC would be considerably less than $2 million or thereabouts. We need to know whether the government would expect the administrative expenses of the new ILC fund to be in excess of $3 million, bearing in mind that there is $24 million of new money. We are saying that the administrative expenses would be something like 15 per cent of $3 million, which is an enormous administrative expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that we already have a body of knowledge, expertise and experience within the land acquisition programs of ATSIC, I wonder whether it is not reasonable to say that $3 million is not an extremely broad and generous cap to have on administrative expenses. The nub of what Senator Chamarette is saying is that it is not only the capping of the administrative expense but also the fact that the Senate would be requesting a further $3 million, as I understand it, plus indexing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is not averse to that doing that. We think it is not unreasonable. We think it is also fiscally responsible. But I just cannot understand the logic of the minister's argument. He is talking close to a 15 per cent administrative expense over and above the millions of dollars in administration within ATSIC already. I think they are important questions for the Senate to understand, and certainly for the opposition to understand, before we make a decision on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also foreshadow that one of the problems we have with the amendment as moved by the Greens is that if we give bureaucratic organisations&mdash;indeed, any organisation, even if it is a private sector organisation&mdash;a cap on a budget of $3 million for administration, it will find a way of spending $3 million on administration. I suggest to the Senate that it consider putting into the proposal put forward by the Greens an incentive within the organisation for the administrative expenses to be minimised. The sort of thing we would be proposing&mdash;I do have amendments drafted to this effect&mdash;is firstly, to request that the administration seek to be efficient and minimise its cost, and secondly, to require that any savings out of the administration budget be applied to land acquisition. I foreshadow those amendments to the Greens' proposal. </PARA>

One of the differences that Aboriginal people point out between their system and ours is that their laws and cultural mores, while not immutable, take a long time to change, and ours can be changed here in an afternoon.

But what concerns me most of all is that when I showed the graph in the chamber, and I used the so-called indicative amount to indicate that there would be a constant drain of $3 million away from the fund altogether, there was no discussion about that except Senator Campbell suggesting that, as more and more of the fund got used up for management, the administration costs may well increase. What I was pointing out at that point was how quickly the money allocated for acquisition would disappear&mdash;so quickly that the people who were least capable of mobilising themselves to make requests of the fund would be most penalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now what we are having is direct confirmation of what Senator Campbell said, which is that there is a refusal by the government to even contemplate tying it into less than $3 million or increasing the amount for acquisition by $3 million.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think one of the issues that is being either avoided or ignored in this debate is that what Senator Chamarette's proposal seeks to do is not so much to quarantine the administrative expense, but to quarantine the moneys available for land acquisition and management. The coalition opposed limiting the management expenses because we thought it was unreasonable to make those sorts of judgements in advance. There may be periods when land acquisition may not be the most sensible use of the money in a particular fiscal year, and there may be very good reasons for spending more money on management. So we thought it was unreasonable to constrict the management of the fund and the corporation in those terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to administration, the coalition would have a different position, and that is because administration is quite often a centralised, bureaucratic institution that can, if it is done properly, be minimised and made efficient. The coalition's leaning on this amendment is to say that if we are going to be giving $24 million for land acquisition in the coming years&mdash;$24 million new&mdash;then there is merit in saying, `Let's minimise the administration impact.' It flows very much from the impassioned plea I made earlier this day in relation to setting up two funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition shares the view of the Greens that it is the quarantine of the land acquisition and management money, the money that actually gets to the ground and that does the good, we hope. The key issue, therefore&mdash;and this is the question that has not been answered by either the government or the Democrats, and I would be interested in an answer to it&mdash;is, is the government opposed to the cap and the principle of quarantining the land acquisition and management money or is the government opposed to allocating $3 million new plus indexing for the administrative expense?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that Senator Collins's point makes Senator Chamarette's point. If it proves that all of this terrible consultation is going to ensure that the administrative expenses blow out from seven, eight or ten per cent, which is what we might hope they would be, to 15 or 20 per cent, then it is something that can come back to this parliament. But it is probably more likely that the administrative expense will come back and be looked at than the land acquisition and management amount, and of course, there is nothing to stop both coming back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are really doing is saying we are capping the bureaucracy&mdash;we are capping the photocopying paper, we are capping all of the bureaucratic expenses that do not particularly, significantly and directly help Aboriginal people&mdash;but allowing the quarantining of the amount for land acquisition and management.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, members of the organisation may have to fly somewhere to consult, but the organisation may have exceeded, for whatever reason, the $3 million. it happens to be a fact in the real world&mdash;not the world that Senator Chamarette lives in&mdash;that one of the consistent problems the land councils have in the Northern Territory in negotiating the land matters that they have to negotiate is the very significant consultation they have to undertake, for example, when new amendments are passed in parliament putting time limits on negotiations and so on. The request that is often made for supplementation is in respect of the necessity for them to consult with their constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted what Senator Campbell said casually a few minutes ago. This is the same argument that was used when we were talking about the problem of proroguing parliament and interfering at that point with the ILC. The fact is that this is a legislated amount. There is no discretion here. The ILC cannot, by law, go one cent over $3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell might think that it is an easy matter to amend an act of parliament and get it through both houses on every occasion, but the facts are: if it is for legitimate reasons, the organisation will be dealt with in the same way that every other organisation is dealt with that spends too much on administration. I have to say that the scrutiny processes of this parliament are as good as any in the world, and fairly effective. Senate estimate committees are effective in terms of the almost limitless scrutiny that they can apply to these kinds of things, and of having administrative expenses put under the microscope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with legislating for it is that if, for the best reasons in the world, the ILC has to charter aircraft&mdash;and they are not cheap, I can tell Senator Chamarette: to get a twin engine aircraft these days costs between $1,000 and $2,000 a day to go anywhere, pretty much&mdash;and it has reached the $3 million legislated mark, it cannot do it. It has to stop until we amend an act of parliament to allow it, from time to time, to go over its administrative expenses.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an incredibly blunt instrument to use to tackle what Senator Campbell is talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude on an important point with which I am in total agreement with Senator Campbell, and that is the question of  management which he and Senator Chamarette alluded to.

I do want to emphasise this, because I have strong personal views on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely vitally important that the board sensibly provide for the circumstances in which it is relevant adequate management support after the acquisition. I have said publicly, I have said it in the cabinet room, outside of the cabinet room and in here, that the single most effective reason why there has been, regrettably, a profound failure of many Aboriginal enterprises, particularly pastoral enterprises around Australia, and it is an identified reason, is that there has been a concentration on acquisition without adequate follow up with management resources then applied to these properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kimberley Land Council will tell Senator Chamarette that as will the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. I am glad that amendment was defeated, but Senator Chamarette has made another reference to management. It is vitally important that the board be left with the discretion to apply adequate funds for the management of these properties for the benefit of the Aboriginal people that will get them and, I might add, for the credibility of the program. I am not frightened to say that again, although Senator Chamarette is very dismissive about it. One of the reasons why credibility of land acquisition programs has suffered badly in the public forum is that there were some, unquestionably, profound failures, in terms of management of properties which were acquired for the benefit of Aboriginals, which meant that the intended beneficiaries got nothing out of it except bad press. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vitally important that that management component is given high priority by this organisation. I put to the chamber again, with as much reasonableness as I can, that it is extraordinary and unique situation to impose on a commercial statutory body a legislative restriction on its administrative expenses before the body has even started, to test whether it can be responsible. It will require, if for the best reasons in the world it goes beyond its administrative expenses, an amendment of an act of parliament to allow it to do it. </PARA>

It will be an interesting exercise to see what will happen if, for perfectly legitimate reasons, it determines to exercise that power, which I think has been supported here, to make those borrowing limits to increase its acquisitions, which by necessity will require additional administrative expenses and consultation but will still be shackled by the $3 million limit set by this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The sum of $3 million relates only to the $24 million; it does not relate to the $45 million. The estimates statement I have for 1994-95 for ATSIC states quite clearly that in its land acquisition program $2.4 million is allocated for administration. That leaves the other $21 million which is used for land acquisition. So if we are going to talk about the total of $45 million, we would have to say that total administration costs would be $5.4 million. What we have done is quarantine the money available for expenditure on land acquisition and management. That is $24 million. As to this being a unique provision; it is. The legislation is unique. There is nothing quite like it on the statute books.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is quite innovative might require innovative measures. To set the administrative costs with a cap of $3 million is not unusual when we compare it with the ATSIC statement because the ATSIC statement really has administration costs running at 10 per cent, maybe 10.5 per cent. The $3 million cap over $24 million runs at something like 12.5 per cent. So we have allowed an extra two per cent margin. If we accept Senator Collins's comments that $3 million is not enough, we would have to be conceding that the Indigenous Land Corporation needs a greater percentage for administrative costs than ATSIC does. In fact, we would have to be conceding that it would be starting to run into inefficiency problems. If administrative costs got up to the realm of 15 per cent, we would need to have a serious look at this corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing I might say is that the consultative process will require some resources. Nonetheless, in the drafting of the amendments which have now been accepted, we can see that the Green amendments mention in part `as far as practicable, as far as possible'. This did not place an absolute mandate for the ILC to go out and exhaustively consult until there was no-one left standing who had not been consulted. What the document said was that in the circumstances the ILC had to do its level best to make sure that everybody was consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the constraints on that is its budget. If it had an administration budget of $45 million, it could individually interview, I dare say, every Aboriginal person in this country. But the budget does not allow it to do that. The Greens in their amendments recognise that with the essential phrase `as far as practicable'. I refer senators back to the J series amendments. The consultative process will cost money, but it will not blow out the administrative costs as mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cap of $3 million is reasonable. As proposed in the further amendments to come, there is a review mechanism after three years whereby, if this is not enough, a necessary amendment can be made. I dare say that inflation will not be running rampant in the next three years, if the government is to be believed. If inflation stays in accordance with the projected analysis of the government, $3 million will remain $3 million and will not be worth only $2 million or $1.5 million in three years. I am saying that this is a reasonable figure. It has been looked at in comparison to ATSIC. An extra two per cent has been allowed on that administrative cost.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an incentive in Senator Campbell's foreshadowed amendment that the ILC will keep its administrative costs to a minimum because, if it does, there is a bonus. The bonus is that what is not spent goes into land acquisition and land management. That would come up in the review, and everybody would say what a great organisation it was because it had managed to keep its costs down and thereby afford more money into the general fund for the purpose for which it was set up. I think the proposed amendment is sensible. Those who are voting against it are really saying that they do not want to protect that $24 million which is set aside for land acquisition and land management. It is really a grant of a further $3 million per year. It would lessen the strain on the funds which are there for land acquisition and land management. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the points that the government wishes to make have already been made by Senator Collins, and I think I would simply be being repetitive. There are two thrusts here: one is to set a limit, effectively, of $3 million; the other is to provide for an amount of $3 million to go into the pool in addition to that which the government has been prepared to commit so far&mdash;both, on the face of them, worthy and not totally unreasonable objectives but, in practice, I am afraid, amounting to just that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budgetary dimensions of this whole affair have been thoroughly worked out in terms of all the other constraints upon us in terms of running the government. It is a pretty cavalier kind of enterprise&mdash;particularly for the opposition, which is always telling us so much about fiscal responsibility&mdash;to, with a stroke of the legislative pen, commit us to another $3 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was always anticipated, of course, that there be a reasonable component of whatever moneys were drawn down from the fund that would have to be devoted to administration. Obviously, it is in everybody's interests that that amount be minimised and the maximum be left for the land acquisition and land management functions. From that point of view, I certainly have no quarrel with the proposed additional amendment AA8 that has been foreshadowed by the opposition to the extent it states that stricture in those sorts of terms. But to in effect be dragging another $3 million out of the government's consolidated revenue for this purpose when we have indicated already how far we are prepared to go and when that has been an element, obviously, in all the consultative processes&mdash;everyone has understood that there is an administrative component in it&mdash;I think is to place an unreasonable burden upon the government, given all our other responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to whether the amount of $3 million, or as indexed in subsequent years, is an unreasonable constraint, let me make the obvious point that, as a percentage of total cost, three on 24 is only 12 1/2 per cent at the moment but three on 45, which will be the situation three years out&mdash;</PARA>

A figure of the order of six or seven per cent I do not think in anyone's estimate is an unreasonable proportion to devote to administrative expenses. This is an organisation that has to go through start up and has to hit the ground running, and those sorts of costs will simply be involved. I think it is only nauseous repetition for me to go through this if the Senate majority's mind is made up. It is just another problem to add to the pile we will have to confront later on.

<PARA>I made some comments earlier explaining why we have withdrawn amendments 1 and 2&mdash;the reason being that we have been willing to replace them with this amendment. The thrust of this amendment is to hold the government to its claim that the fund will be self-sustaining over 10 years. We want to legislate to make sure that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To achieve an appropriate level of self-sustainability, a four per cent real rate of investment is required. If the fund fails to achieve that target amount over the 10-year period, this amendment would require the government to top up the fund to achieve what would be the expected value of the fund at that point in time. The target amount is defined in the proposed clauses 193(2)(b) and 193(2)(c) as $1.1 billion indexed to inflation. That represents the net present value of the fund, assuming a seven per cent return over the next 10 years. This is all based on calculations from the Department of Finance. The result of the government's guarantee, by way of this amendment, would be that at the end of 10 years the land fund would be worth more than $1.4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we are entitled to be concerned that we could not get a four per cent real return on cash instruments with the land fund without purchasing higher levels of risk, but it is worth pointing out that the Minister for Finance is authorised under section 62B of the Audit Act to invest in other investments. If the cash instruments do fail to achieve four per cent averaged over several years, I would expect that the minister might seek in the future to use the provisions in the Financial Management and Accountability Act&mdash;which we will be debating in the Senate next year&mdash;to improve the investment performance of the fund to avoid the possibility of a large top-up at the end of the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this amendment the top-up would be paid on the first business day of the year 2005-06. It would be based on the Minister for Finance's assessment of the value of investments as at that point. In making that assessment, the minister will be required to have regard to the audited financial statements of the fund. Hopefully, this will ensure that the minister does not overvalue the book value of the investments to reduce the top-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consolidated revenue fund would be automatically appropriated for the top-up amount under section 193(5) as it presently reads. I think it is satisfactory that this guarantee is included in the legislation, that it carries with it a standing appropriation, and that it cannot be changed without the consent of the Senate. That is probably as strong a guarantee as the government can possibly provide&mdash;particularly to the effect that a four per cent real return can be achieved, thus resulting in a sustainable land fund. That was the promise, and we merely seek to hold the government to that promise. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments deal with the situation where payments are made out of consolidated revenue to the ILC under proposed section 193A, and when similar payments are made to ATSIC under section 193B. These amendments ensure that there is a single annual payment made rather than two instalments, thus giving the ILC and ATSIC the money at the beginning of each calendar year. This will allow the ILC and ATSIC the flexibility of being able to invest or disburse the money. It is an attempt to optimise the money that will be available. My understanding is that the government has indicated some support for this principle. Certainly, I think the government mentioned that it would agree with amendment C1 and, as amendment C3 is identical, I should not imagine that it would present a problem.

If the fund was failing to meet its four per cent benchmark, I imagine the ILC directors would have the opportunity to ask some very serious questions of those making investments under this section. As the bill in section 193F allows the minister to delegate his investment powers to an officer of ATSIC, I would expect that the elected commissioners of ATSIC would also keep a close eye on the performance of its commercial division; although, of course, the elected commissioners could not override any directions of the Minister for Finance. It is just a way of beefing up the second line of accountability. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment deals with proposed paragraph 193I(2)(d) and entails the insertion of subparagraph (da), which deals with the annual report of the land fund. This requires that, further to all the other specified subjects which are to be covered in the annual report, there should be the catch-all provision that there be `such other information as either House of the Parliament may require, such requirement to be specified in a resolution of that House'. So a majority of the house would have to resolve that some subject of information or some aspect be included. It could be a specific detail or a bit more general. Nonetheless, it allows parliament to inform itself of other aspects which it thinks are pertinent, other than the matters mentioned in proposed paragraph 193I. </PARA>

But the coalition thought that there may be matters which parliament needs to inform itself of. That is what this proposal allows.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another example of a rather innocuous-looking little clause which, unfortunately, packs more of a punch than the government is prepared to accept. We see this as a very unusual requirement and one that is totally unnecessary as an additional imposition on an agency which already has to satisfy and demonstrate the highest level of accountability pursuant to a whole series of strictures that presently lie upon it. The bill, as has been said, already requires detailed information on the operations of the land fund to be provided to parliament and allows regulations to be made&mdash;as Senator Harradine just pointed out&mdash;to require the provision of further information, if it is thought appropriate for that to be pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment, as we see it, places unnecessarily onerous further requirements and does not add in any necessary way to the stringent accountability requirements which are already there. There is no provision in legislation for comparable or similar statutory authorities. In fact, the draftsmen tell us that they are unable to find or to recollect any similar provision in any other piece of legislation. When resolutions of the parliament are specified, as they often are in legislation, it is always in reference to both houses of parliament. The amendment, as drafted, requiring a resolution by either house, could, among other things, lead to a situation where the two houses were passing contradictory resolutions&mdash;thereby conceivably creating even more unnecessary confusion and difficulties in compliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see this as another exercise in hindering&mdash;whether intentionally or not&mdash;the workings of the land fund by imposing upon it stricter accountability and reporting requirements than apply to comparable agencies. There will be ample information available to parliament not only through the annual report but also through the Auditor-General's report and through the Senate estimates process. There is ample opportunity for parliament to gain more information if necessary not only through those processes but also, I guess, through the native title committee, which will be looking at the land fund, and through questions asked of the minister in the normal way. So with all those things going for us, we need this additional requirement like the proverbial hole in the head.

A $100 million borrowing amount would certainly be inappropriate, if the money and the fund were to be increased. The Greens would not want to disallow that possibility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to have to say that these are more amendments that do not appeal to the government, for the following reasons. They have to do with accountability and they have to do with appropriate limitations for bodies of this kind in the interests of maintaining fiscal rectitude. Most Commonwealth statutory authorities cannot borrow money without specific approval from the Treasurer. The ILC does not require such approval. But there is, nonetheless, a need for the Commonwealth to ensure that the ILC does not incur significant debts which might have to be paid back from general revenue. It would be quite irresponsible, under those circumstances, for the government not to place some limit on the borrowing powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combined limit on borrowings and guarantees is approximately four times the ILC's annual drawdown from the land fund. In years one to three the limit is $100 million compared with drawdowns of $25 million in year one and $24 million in years two and three. In subsequent years the limit is $200 million compared with drawdowns of $45 million in years four to 10. The limit has been set at a level which ensures that the corporation is able to meet its financial commitments but, nonetheless, allows it to operate in  a commercial manner using its anticipated income stream to take account of opportunities as they arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Removing borrowing limits on the ILC would leave the corporation vulnerable to significant debt. One assumes responsibility, of course, on the part of corporation members, board members, but, in the interests of good sense and looking far ahead into the future and at basic principles of public administration, it is not desirable to leave it open-ended in this way. Were the ILC to get itself into debt, one might then have pressure upon governments to abolish the whole operation on the basis of some unacceptable drain on public moneys.

<PARA>The amendments really are quite similar. Amendments Nos 46 and 47 deal with section 193S, subsections (3) and (5) respectively. The amendment is identical in either case: it seeks to omit the word `or' and replace it with `and'. This has the effect of making it cumulative and not an alternative. This deals with an ILC officer not disclosing certain information. It is reminiscent of the print media inquiry: it deals with this aspect of commercial-in-confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In subsection (3) there is the requirement that an ILC officer must not, either directly or indirectly, disclose to any person any information concerning the affairs of another person acquired by that officer where&mdash;and this is the crucial part&mdash;it was either acquired by the officer in the performance of his or her duties in connection with an application for the giving of a guarantee, et cetera, or, secondly, the disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to prejudice substantially the commercial interests of the other person. It is the coalition's view that it should be a cumulative test and not a test on an either/or basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's view is that disclosure should be prohibited if the information was acquired in the course of the officer's duties and that the disclosure could substantially prejudice the commercial interests of another person. I am looking at similar provisions in the home savings grant and banking acts. The insertion of the word `and' fits more comfortably with similar provisions in other Commonwealth statutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, the test in the first instance that the information was simply acquired by the officer in the course of that officer's duties is perhaps too low a threshold. One should really make out some sort of prejudice to be suffered before the disclosure of that information is prohibited. It deals only with commercial information; it does not touch on those matters which might be of significance to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, under subsection (5), an ILC officer must not disclose to a court of law information which is acquired in the same manner. The coalition's view is that the disclosure of information to a court of law is very serious indeed because it goes right to the core of evidence that might be required to try an issue. If the court does not have that information before it, it might not arrive at a decision which is just in all the circumstances. It has to be very serious indeed before parliament prohibits information going before a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is tied in with amendment 48, which relates to 193S(7), which deals with the disclosure of information for the purposes of criminal proceedings. That is even more serious because one is dealing with criminal proceedings there. The proceedings I have just mentioned I take to be civil proceedings. In our legal system we always place perhaps more emphasis on criminal proceedings because the liberty of an individual might be at stake, which makes it all the more important to make sure that the ends of justice are served. I can appreciate that these amendments might have to be put separately, but I thought I would address them as a package in order to save time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the government's position, subsection (7) says that the prohibition on disclosure does not apply for prosecutions under the Crimes Act&mdash;but only certain prosecutions. They are offences against sections 5, 6, 7, 7A, 29C or 29D or 86(1), and also prosecutions in relation to the act or regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition's firm view that the disclosure of information&mdash;that is not the information which might be of a cultural or sensitive nature to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people; this is strictly nuts and bolts information dealing with transactions, loans, guarantees, et cetera&mdash;should never be prohibited from being disclosed to any criminal proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just give the committee an example of a case in which I was involved at the beginning of last year. That was where an eastern states criminal syndicate used an Aboriginal person as a front man to acquire a pastoral lease for the purposes of growing a large crop of marijuana. Of course, the Aboriginal person applied under certain aspects of state law for the pastoral lease. Once the syndicate got it via their front man, they then grew a cannabis crop, cultivated it, ran it and did everything else that was needed. Nonetheless, during the very lengthy trial, the prosecution needed to get and bring forward application forms, the forms that were used by the department in granting the pastoral lease to prove that this person had in fact made the application, the dates on which it was made and the purpose which was stated on the application form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that the Crimes Act is not enough because there are other acts of parliament touching on criminal law which could well impinge on this section. I am not saying that it will happen in the future, but I have given the committee a concrete example of where an Aboriginal person was used by a syndicate&mdash;and the court recognised, I might say, in the subsequent decision which it came to, in the sentences that were handed down, that this person was used as a front man. I know that to be the case because I represented the Aboriginal person who was used as a front man. It was useful for the defence, not just the prosecution, to have information brought to light because there were allegations made which needed to be ventilated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just essential for the prosecution of an offence, but it could well be absolutely essential to the defence to have documentation brought before a court. It might be that the prosecution says that there was a matter of fraud in another matter and that there was a conspiracy to acquire land and sell it at an inflated value, or that there was a conspiracy to commit another crime on this land, and that the person concerned who is accused signed a piece of paper in the furtherance of that conspiracy. The person says, `I never signed any piece of paper.' That person would need to have available the opportunity to bring the piece of paper, the form, into the court of law and say, `There is the loan application. I didn't sign it. I was not a party to that.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way that the bill sits at the moment could well prohibit that and could well severely impede the interests of justice. I think that is a most serious situation. I do not think the government has done this deliberately. I think it is really an oversight. In any case, documents should never be withheld from criminal proceedings because at the end of the day the most superior jurisdiction of all is the criminal jurisdiction and the most serious sanction a state can levy on one of its citizens is imprisonment. Where that person might have their defence thwarted by not having access to documentation, I think it is a serious state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two matters are somewhat different. I put 46 and 47 in a different category. I believe that the test should be tightened. It was during the print media inquiry that we saw the test of commercial-in-confidence&mdash;that the government was able to withhold documentation from a Senate committee of inquiry. I do not want to go down that political burrow again. Suffice to say that parliament needs to be informed of certain things. Before you cut off the availability of documentation to parliament or before you cut off the availability of documentation to a court of law, you must be very sure indeed of what you are doing. I think the test must be a very high one before you say that a document cannot come before a court of law in proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in this case the test is simply too weak a test. If it is something that was acquired by the officer in the performance of his or her duties, it cannot be disclosed or it cannot be brought before a court of law. I think that test is too low; the threshold is too low. It should be strengthened and it should be made cumulative with the second part of the subsection, which says that it must also have the potential to substantially prejudice the commercial interests of another person. So the test must have two elements to it and they must be cumulative and not seen as alternatives. That is the reason for proposing that. Mr Temporary Chairman, it may be that these amendments have to be put separately; nonetheless, I have addressed them cognately in the interest of saving time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sad to say that the government has difficulty with these amendments&mdash;not the same order of difficulty as with some of the other things that have gone to the fundamental workability of the legislation. Nonetheless, we think, on balance, the bill is better drafted as it is. Let me explain why.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to 46 and 47, this little substitution of `and' for `or' really does make quite a significant difference to the operation of this provision. If the amendment were to be carried, it would require that an ILC officer must not disclose information about another person where that information was both obtained in the course of his duty and where disclosure could prejudice commercial interests of the other person. The proposed amendment, by virtue of that additional cumulative requirement, waters down the protection for commercially sensitive information. That is something we ought to be very reluctant to concede. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment would adversely affect, in that sense, the ILC's ability to operate in a commercial environment, in particular, by opening up the possibility that commercial-in-confidence information acquired by ILC officers when performing land management functions could be disclosed. It would not prevent disclosure of such information; for example, if the ILC manages a property under a commercial agreement, an ILC officer would not be prohibited from disclosing information acquired about the landowner's affairs that could affect the market value of the property because the information would not have been acquired in connection with the giving of a grant, loan or guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By virtue of making the requirements cumulative in this way, one limits the capacity to protect certain categories of information which are prejudicial to others but may not have been acquired strictly in the course of this duty. We wanted to make that limit in order to improve the commercial viability of the ILC. Where we have a body like this which has a mixture of both commercial and non-commercial functions, this kind of drafting does make some sense. It is based on a similar provision in section 114 of the development allowance assistance act 1992. I hope the opposition might be prepared to reconsider it on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to amendment 48, it is about quite a different subject matter, as has been acknowledged. The subsection as it is now drafted is to the same effect as other secrecy provisions in the ATSIC Act which apply to ATSIC itself, and to the Commercial Development Corporation. I am referring to sections 90 and 191. This allows, under the present drafting, disclosure of ILC information and documents only if there is a prosecution for an offence against this act or certain other Commonwealth offences which relate to this act. The amendment, as Senator Ellison has said, would change that to allow disclosure for the purpose of any criminal offence, including offences under state or territory laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a nice question of balance here. There may be individual cases which one can cite, as Senator Ellison did, where, on the face of it, there has not been any particular harm done in the disclosure and which has advanced the cause of a legitimate prosecution. But it is a matter of weighing and balancing the other competing values here&mdash;that is, the need to, so far as is humanly possible, keep sensitive financial commercial information confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the additional reinforcing concern when one is dealing with Aboriginal legislation of this kind that a lot of the information one is dealing with is extraordinarily sensitive on cultural grounds. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will consider the validity of that aspect of the matter.

That balance has been struck in favour of preserving the integrity of the financial information.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Harradine for that contribution. I have not been indebted to him for too much else during the course of this debate, but we are grateful. As to amendment 48, having had a chance now to look at the terms of the bill, I have to say that the protection for sacred information in clause 193S(3)(b) cannot override the prosecution exception that is set out in subclause 7 of that same clause.</PARA></TALK.START>

Subclause 3&mdash;including 3(b), which is the protection of disclosure of sacred information&mdash;is overridden by the clauses presently drafted. Since the opposition would widen out clause 7 in this way, it overrides it again. It is only a debating point, but the sacred information does come into play. We are worried about the disclosure of that inadvertently through this sort of process. </PARA>

It would have to include 3(c) and 5(c), because (a) and (c) respectively in the discrete clauses deal with the commercial aspects only, whereas (b) and (d) in the two clauses deal with the other information.

For that reason, we now indicate that we are not happy to support 46 and 47, but we are prepared to support 48.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I can confirm that. Amendments Nos 46 and 47 are civil matters dealing with commercial information only. Amendment No. 48 is purely criminal which deals with commercial information only. Whilst we are on this subject, I see the importance of these amendments in descending order to be thus: 48 is most important, because it deals with the individual's liberty, guilt or innocence; 47 is next important, because it deals with the court of law and a civil action; and 46 is least important, because it is simply disclosure to the world at large.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the arguments that Senator Gareth Evans has raised in relation to No. 46. But in relation to 47, I maintain that there could be a situation where one person is suing another person and, during the course of that litigation, it comes to light that essential evidence is tied up in the ILC grant. The case might not relate to the aspect of a grant of land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often we see cases in courts of law where the evidence has to be produced from other sources, matters or transactions. For instance, I can cite to you family law where third parties are often brought in. A husband and wife may have gone into business together but, when they have a disagreement, they often have to involve third parties. In the interests of justice, those third parties have to be brought into it; otherwise, justice between the husband and wife could not be meted out pursuant to section 79 of the Family Law Act, which is a property law settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just given an instance of family law. I can give a commercial instance. Someone might say, `You entered into a contract for me on the basis of something else happening.' That something else might have been that a third party, who might have been the recipient of a grant of land under the scheme, was going to do other things. For that third party, with terms and conditions attached to the grant of money, the loan or the guarantee might become relevant to the contract that the former two parties went into. I ask the committee to bear in mind that quite often in litigation, whilst pursuing matters for the defence or for the plaintiff, relevant information can come up which is entirely removed from the proceedings. </PARA>

I do not think it will interfere with his intentions if I deal with my three amendments, especially as I am not overly optimistic about amendment P. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment Q1 is very important in that it seeks to insert at the end of clause 3 a new division concerning dispossession. Currently the bill does not make it clear whether or not this legislation is intended to be compensation for dispossession. The Greens (WA) believe that this bill should not be seen as compensation and nothing in it should prevent claims for compensation being made in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are concerned that the associated rhetoric from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) and the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) might lead people to understand that this is the major act of compensation for dispossession and this may then lead to the land fund being taken as compensation for dispossession. Compensation for dispossession does not come at $45 million a year. Compensation for dispossession would be incalculable. It certainly cannot be made into a neat formula that can be inserted in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Greens see it as important that the legislation leaves the option open for compensation to be sought at another time and on different bases. Thus the legislation should include a clause which specifically states that this is not compensation for dispossession and that nothing in this bill prevents claims for compensation being made. That is basically our Q1 amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment R is also a very important amendment. It relates to the revival of native title. This amendment creates a new division at the end of part 4 of the ATSIC act, which deals with the extinguishment of native title on indigenous held land. This amendment statutorily sets aside any extinguishment of native title on any land which has been acquired, set aside or dedicated for the benefit of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders. In doing so, it provides for the revival of native title similar to the revival of native title on mining leases under the Native Title Act 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the object of this bill is to restore land to Australia's indigenous people, it is important that they have the land restored to them in terms which are appropriate to them. If this land is to be treated as indigenous held land, as the government keeps arguing, it should be treated as other indigenous held land, as land where native title rights remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move on to amendment P, I would like to refer to two quotes. One is from His Honour Justice Brennan in his decision in Mabo (No. 2) v. Queensland, where he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the governments of the Australian Colonies and, latterly, the governments of the Commonwealth, States and Territories have alienated or appropriated to their own purposes most of the land in this country during the last 200 years, the Australian Aboriginal peoples have been substantially dispossessed of their traditional lands. They were dispossessed by the Crown's exercise of its sovereign powers to grant land to whom it chose and to appropriate to itself the beneficial ownership of parcels of land for the Crown's purposes . . . Aboriginals were dispossessed of their land parcel by parcel, to make way for expanding colonial settlement. Their dispossession underwrote the development of the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>Although I wanted to refer to that quote earlier, it is appropriate that I do so now. The amendment has tremendous potential and is spiritually very meaningful. The idea for the amendment was provided by a group of people who wrote to the Aboriginal community. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two key issues have come up: first, whether the $25 million will be anywhere near enough for the fund. It has been suggested that the Bill be amended to set the amount at $250 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that amendment has been lost. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second issue is what rights can be exercised over the land purchased under the fund. Currently, only the bare title will be purchased. It has been suggested that the Bill be amended so that native title revives on any lands purchased under the fund.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter is signed by Lucas Maynard, ATSIC Commissioner, and Michael Mansell, Aboriginal Provisional Government. It is endorsed by the Aboriginal Legal Rights Movement in South Australia, FAIRA, Queensland, and Framlingham Aboriginal Trust, Victoria. I think it is a very meaningful and significant amendment, and I would appeal to fellow senators to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the people who were approached&mdash;Aboriginal brothers and sisters around the country&mdash;were not given any optimistic or unrealistic expectation that the opposition would support it, but I would like to ask it to. The letter also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government have not indicated support for these amendments. It is unclear what the Opposition's view would be, but it is not likely to be favourable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If these changes are important, Government support is essential for them to be made law. Unless the Aboriginal community shows support, the Government will not move.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the government will move because of the spirit of the amendment. I commend that amendment to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final amendment is also symbolic, but I think it has got less chance than the previous amendment of being passed. It deals with the repeal of the sunset clause in the Northern Territory land rights act. I have already discussed how I think that it was a disgrace that the sunset clause was put into the land rights act and that it passed through this chamber without a murmur. This is another chance for us to reassert our position on that particular issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment inserts a provision in the bill to repeal section 50(2A) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The issue of the split of moneys between ATSIC and the ILC threw into the spotlight the whole issue of the sunset clause on claims under the Northern Territory land rights act. The whole reason for diverting half the money through ATSIC would appear to be to maximise the amount of land which can be acquired in the Northern Territory in the next three years so that it can be claimed before the sunset clause comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was shocked to discover that it was in fact the Hawke government which moved to place a limit on the time available for claims under the Northern Territory land rights act, which we know was introduced in 1976 under the Fraser government. I was shocked to find that there was a total absence of any opposition in either house of the parliament and I ask: why should there be a limit on time available for land to be claimed in the Northern Territory? This amendment removes the so-called sunset clause and thus allows claims over lands in the Northern Territory to continue beyond 1997. I request that the amendments be voted on separately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry to disappoint Senator Chamarette, but I am afraid that these amendments, which she describes as meaningful and significant, look pretty quixotic to us and we do not support any of them. As to the Greens amendment Q, which goes to the question of claims for compensation and argues in the proposed clause that nothing in this part is intended as compensation for dispossession, let me say just three things. Firstly, it is manifestly wrong to claim that nothing in this bill is intended as compensation for dispossession. The provision of $1.5 billion that is here provided for is certainly intended as one step in the process of recognition of indigenous dispossession and some compensation for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government certainly does not want in any way to create the impression that this represents the totality of a final settlement. We have said over and over again that this is only part of the government's broad response to the Mabo decision. There is nothing in the bill which says that this is the government's final position and it certainly should not be understood as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the clause is quite unnecessary because, as a basic principle of statutory interpretation, we do not override common law rights unless by express statutory language, and there is certainly nothing in this legislation which could be so construed as an express overriding of any other claims that might be available as a matter of common law. So amendment Q hits the fence on at least three good grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to amendment R, prior extinguishment of native title being disregarded, I have to say that this is really a fairly extraordinary proposal. There is lots that I could say about it but in a nutshell it comes down to this: this proposal means that, if any land is acquired or set aside for the benefit of indigenous people for any purpose, any previous extinguishment of native title over that land will be disregarded, and presumably native title or the potential for a native title claim would be re-established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section will apply to any acquisition or dedication of land under any Commonwealth law whether related to this act or not, and arguably the provision will also apply to state laws as well. The section will provide for the non-extinguishment of native title, even over land which has been freehold for over 100 years. There is much more that I could say to further develop that argument and the consequences of it, but I think it will be appreciated that it is simply wholly unrealistic in terms of the basic principles of the native title legislation that we wrangled over for so long in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some certainty in terms of what the effect of past extinguishments has been and the notion that native title claims could potentially re-arise, albeit with all the difficulties of establishing continuity of relationship and so on. Nonetheless, the element of uncertainty would be utterly at odds with the bargain that was struck, as it were, in the basic philosophy and approach of the native title legislation. While one understands the motivation, again I have to say that it is all a bit quixotic.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with amendment P, the third one, repealing the sunset clause of the Northern Territory land rights act, would not benefit indigenous people, I do not think, but would certainly introduce an element of uncertainty in relation to land claims in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This again is an issue that has been hard fought over. There are elements of balance of judgment involved in the competing issues that are concerned. Indigenous people will have had over 20 years to claim land under the Northern Territory land rights act. We believe that is sufficient time to enable any claims with any character of credibility about them to emerge and to be made in that time frame. Again, it is important that we get the kind of certainty that governments have been arguing about and fighting about in the Northern Territory context for a long time. This sunset clause is an acceptable way through that, and we certainly would not accept its repeal in this particular exercise here. For all those reasons, we oppose all three of the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support almost all of the arguments used by Senator Evans. I may introduce one or two others. On compensation for dispossession, I think Senator Evans is quite right. I do not think anything we say in this legislation is going to make that debate go away, nor make any difference to the outcome of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to amendment R, the matter about any purchase by the ILC making past extinguishments of no effect. The action of section 47 of the Native Title Act ensures that those whose ongoing link with the land is broken because there has been a past extinguishment would be able to reassert their native title rights. The effect of amendment R, as I understand it, is that past extinguishments would have been made void on any land purchased by the ILC. I think that amendment would work against the potential for the Native Title Act and the concept of native title getting broader understanding and acceptance in the Australian community, and certainly it would work against the potential for the land fund and its objects getting accepted in the broader community. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On amendment R, revisiting the native title debate, we certainly supported certainty for past extinguishment, which is one of the reasons that we, instead of the opposition, moved the amendment for the farmers. </PARA>

Senator Chamarette said that it went through the parliament without a murmur. I understand the argument here and I think that, of all the areas of Australia that need some time for Aboriginal people to work through their claims, the Northern Territory is certainly the primary case.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to indicate that the arguments that have been advanced in opposition to Q1 and R1 are persuasive. I am supporting, however, amendment P1 of the Greens. We are talking about 1997. That is not very far away. There is a whole new ballgame now. It is all very well for the minister to say that the Aboriginal people have had 20 years to make claims. I think I heard Senator Chamarette say, `What with?' But that is slightly beside the point, I guess.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not normally like to interfere unduly with decisions and agreements that have been made between states or territories and the federal government. But this parliament has clearly been given the power on Aboriginal matters by the people. Under those circumstances, and having regard to my view that another 2 1/2 years is not long enough, I think it is desirable to repeal the sunset clause. What the government might like to do about that when the bill comes back to this chamber is another question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in the debate on a previous amendment, it may be coincidental that the amendment I was speaking upon had the same running time as the sunset clause. Then again, it may not be. Perhaps the government will wish to provide a little extra time. I can understand the argument that has been advanced about wanting certainty&mdash;but, in my view, this is too short a time. I believe the government ought to think about that and when this bill comes back perhaps it could provide an additional amount of time for the claims to be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a brief point. Amendment P1 raises some enormous issues. In the context of this debate on the land fund, which has been covered nationally for the best part of the last few months, the issue of repealing the sunset clause in the Northern Territory land rights legislation is not something that has been debated or given much consideration. It is a debate that should be had, but it is also a debate that should certainly involve the community in the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory government. It is a matter that should be closely considered by all involved. I think that to have that debate at this stage in proceedings is not an appropriate or sensible way for the committee to deal with it.

<PARA>I will as briefly as possible outline the effect of coalition amendments Nos 51, 52 and 53. Amendment No. 51, I presume, will not receive any support. I believe we had the substantive debate on this issue when we discussed Aboriginal trusts under a previous coalition amendment. The effect of the amendment is to remove the requirement&mdash;I will be interested to hear Senator Harradine's view on this&mdash;that organisations regarded as indigenous organisations require an interest of at least 50 per cent. I believe that debate has already been had. Senator Harradine has already indicated, when we debated a previous coalition amendment relating to trusts, that he would not support an organisation being deemed to be an indigenous organisation if it had less than 50 per cent. This would be the effect of clause 51. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, it would be possible for an Aboriginal corporation to have a shareholding of indigenous people that was lower than 50 per cent. That is the effect of this amendment. We believe there are reasons why it could be an advantage in joint venture operations and so forth for Aboriginal organisations to have shareholdings of less than 50 per cent. But I indicate that I understand there will not be much support in the chamber for amendment 51.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to amendment 52. The effect of this amendment is to ensure that the Joint Committee on Native Title, which was formed under the Native Title Act, will maintain the role that it has been given under the Native Title Act to oversee in a parliamentary capacity as a parliamentary committee the operations of the land fund. As the land fund was initially created under section 201 and the intent was given to it by the preamble, the Native Title Act had the oversight of the implementation of the land fund as it stood. By removing the land fund from the Native Title Act and putting it into the ATSIC Act, we have effectively ensured that the Joint Committee on Native Title would not have the capacity to oversee the implementation and operations of the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this amendment would be to ensure that that does happen. We think it is a good idea that there be a parliamentary committee to oversee this, just as we have a committee overseeing the Native Title Act implementation. That committee, under the chairmanship of Senator Chris Evans, a Labor Senator from Western Australia, has already set off on a series of Australia-wide consultations with a range of interested parties concerned with the implementation of the Native Title Act. The committee has already taken evidence in relation to the land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would be in the very best interests of the parliament and the people of Australia that that committee maintains its role in overseeing the implementation and operation of the land fund. Amendment No 52 changes the name of that committee to the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Land Fund. The effect of amendment No. 53 is to ensure that the Native Title Act is amended so that that parliamentary committee would have the powers and the responsibilities that I have outlined. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not support any of these amendments, although there are different degrees of passion involved in our position. We are certainly wholly opposed to coalition amendment No. 51, which I do not think has much support elsewhere in the chamber. That amendment would enable the land fund to be used, basically, to benefit interests with minimal indigenous membership and control. Whatever other flexibility one might want to invest in the corporation, I do not think anyone really wants to see that being the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a constitutional problem with the way that this amendment would work; to provide the capacity for non-indigenous persons to benefit from the land fund to a greater extent than indigenous persons in particular cases. That is the logic of the amendment. It would not be supported by the races power in section 51 of the constitution. That would really place the whole bill in doubt. That is all that really needs to be said about that particular amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has mixed feelings in relation to amendments No. 52 and No. 53. We rather take the view that further formal parliamentary scrutiny of the land fund is not necessary, given all the 1,001 other accountability mechanisms and reporting processes that are required. We think it de-emphasises the legitimate centrality placed upon the native title issue itself for the parliamentary committee, firstly, to have this additional function and, secondly, to be retitled accordingly. That is not an issue on which I want to waste any more time in this chamber, not least because I know that the numbers are against me. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the report be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA>In moving that the report be adopted, let me briefly indicate the government's position on the future of this legislation. It is a very close run thing as to whether the government will support the bill even going back to the House of Representatives in its present form with so many amendments which we find unconscionable and of a character which will make the bill unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we think the best course to follow is for the bill to be sent back to the House of Representatives, and for the House of Representatives to make a number of changes to the bill, including restoring original provisions, and for the Senate to have a further opportunity a little later down the track to reconsider its position in the hope that, with the benefit of further reflection and further consultation, some better piece of legislation will emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much I could say on the subject of a really quite heartfelt character about our response to the swathes that have been cut through the original concept of the bill, but, given the constraints of time, I will not go into that. I want to outline the major amendments that the Senate has made to this legislation, which we think are absolutely unacceptable in the sense that they will make the bill unworkable for a whole variety of reasons. I will mention some other matters briefly, but the major amendments are seven in number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, the coalition's first amendment, amendment No. 1, requires that the ILC give priority to the most severely dispossessed in performing its functions. As we said, this opens up ILC decisions to legal challenge about who is the most severely dispossessed. It is an inherently unworkable criterion. We believe, moreover, that it is one which will cause conflict in the indigenous community and will be wholly unhelpful in advancing the basic philosophy and objectives of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment that we have most concern about is coalition amendment No. 4 and various consequential amendments that flow from that. The amendment extends the right of the ILC to make grants to individuals and trustees. As we said in debating this amendment, this is contrary to the aim of the land fund which is to provide communal benefits. It is contrary to traditional indigenous land-holding practices. We believe it will reduce accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third problem area is that subsumed in coalition amendment No.7 which requires that grants of land have regard to health, housing and related matters. That is something that we debated exhaustively. We think the basic problem with it is that it de-emphasises the inherent philosophical force of the land fund legislation, which is to provide land as land&mdash;qua land&mdash;as a basis for the wellbeing of indigenous people. To tie the provision of land to a consideration of the extent to which a variety of other objectives will be met, which are not the responsibility of the ILC to advance, will not helpfully reflect that basic philosophy. We have the prospect of these things being justiciable and the potential for controversy as to the extent to which particular grants of land satisfy this particular criterion. A consideration of these issues again contributes to the unworkability of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter that we are concerned about is Greens amendment S1 which requires the ILC to consult traditional owners before acquiring land. On the face of it, it seems a perfectly innocuous amendment and one which is wholly consistent with the general consultative obligations of the ILC, and which are entirely appropriate. However, the way the amendment is cast we believe that it would make much of the ILC's activity in practice unworkable. As we see it, there will be extensive delays while traditional owners are identified. There is doubt over the meaning of `traditional owners'. We are familiar with this problem in a variety of other contexts, having debated this in the context of the native title bill. There is bound to be conflict as to who are the traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of these matters were exhaustively debated at the time. I am only giving a capsule summary of our concerns, but they are real, and they are not based in any sense on a lack of respect for the position of traditional owners, or a feeling that their interests should somehow be subordinated. It is just a concern that far too onerous an obligation is being cast by this amendment on the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth area that causes us real problems is Greens' amendment L1 which relates to the removal of the ILC power to control the disposal of land. This opens up the possibility of sales of land granted by the ILC in order to make quick profits, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons being as capable as any other members of the community of not acting in accordance with the intended philosophy of this legislation. We believe it would lead, over time, to a possible diminution of the indigenous land base. It certainly would reduce accountability, as we see it, for the expenditure of public moneys, particularly when this provision is read in conjunction with that enabling the grant of land to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sixth area of concern goes to the whole question of national and regional strategies and the relationship between them as covered by Greens amendments J2A, J6, J7 and J8. The requirement that a national strategy be based on and derive from regional strategies, and the further requirements that regional strategies be based on wide consultation&mdash;including state and territory governments&mdash;with ILC decisions being based on those strategies, and with no money being distributed in a region until regional strategies are prepared, all combine to create a whole series of real, practical problems. We are not against national and regional strategies being prepared after a proper consultative process in each case&mdash;that is what the bill already provides for&mdash;but there are still problems of working out the national and regional relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the legislation is now couched, these issues&mdash;which previously were non-justiciable, in our judgement&mdash;will be justiciable, thus leading again to the possibility of further litigation, further delay and further controversy. Extensive delays in the preparation of the strategies will now be inherent, with this being a particular problem in the context of the limitation on money being distributed until regional strategies are prepared. The ILC will not have the opportunity to purchase land as new opportunities arise. There will be further avenues for legal challenges to ILC decisions in this respect. Again, I am summarising in a few sentences something which has been the subject of long debate; but I think everyone here knows what these concerns are about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seventh matter of concern to us is one that we addressed this afternoon. It relates to the cap of $3 million per year on ILC administrative expenditure and also to the budgetary problem of the request now being made to add a further $3 million to the pool. We see that cap as being an inhibition to the ILC's ability to operate flexibly and responsibly. While we all want to see administrative costs reduced to the maximum extent possible, the organisation has to run efficiently. There are a great many practical administrative obligations upon it&mdash;many more as a result of the amendments that have been passed in the legislation. The restriction is an artificial and unreasonable one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those major issues&mdash;each one of those is a major issue in the judgment of the government&mdash;there are a number of other amendments that cause us concern. Coalition amendments 33 and 36 remove the requirement for the ATSIC chairperson to be on the ILC board and make provision for only one ATSIC commissioner to be on the board rather than two. Although, in practice, these are capable of being bypassed by  the actual appointment strategy, nonetheless, they reflect an approach to this legislation which does not fully acknowledge the role that ATSIC has played and the real necessity of ATSIC and the ILC having a close and effective working relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems with coalition amendment 42, which we will need to further look at. That amendment was also debated today. It relates to additional requirements coming from the parliament for further information. There is a number of other matters of this kind which do not go to the heart of the legislation in the way that the major matters I have dealt with do; nonetheless, in combination, they add unconscionably to the practical problems that the ILC will face and, as such, need to be given further consideration by the government and by the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We envisage at least those matters to which I have explicitly referred being addressed again in the House of Representatives, with the Senate having another opportunity to think about its position on this some time down the track. I genuinely and sincerely hope that those honourable senators around the chamber&mdash;such as Senator Harradine, in particular&mdash;who I know are absolutely dedicated to the cause, who want to make this work, who are not playing politics in any way with this and who have not really got caught up in Aboriginal politics will give this further, mature, considered consideration over the weeks and months ahead in order that, when this matter comes back to the Senate&mdash;as it is reasonable to anticipate it will&mdash;we might end up with a rather more workable piece of legislation than the one I am afraid we now have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond as briefly as I can to the summing-up of Senator Gareth Evans. The problem the government created for itself and for Australia was that, within a few minutes of our shadow minister, Chris Gallus, presenting the coalition's amendments to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, it said&mdash;with the advice of Prime Minister Keating, we believe&mdash;`No, we will not have a bar of any of the coalition's amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened absolutely intently to Senator Evans and I will do Senator Kernot the courtesy of listening in absolute silence during her contribution. I will try to sum-up as quickly and succinctly as I can and put the position of the coalition. I ask Senator Kernot quite seriously to restrain herself from interjecting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was created because the government made a bad snap judgment and locked itself into a position. Thankfully for Australia, for the debate and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, Senator Evans has been far more sensible in handling the amendments and, indeed, has supported many of the coalition amendments. The Democrats have also supported some of those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems the government created in that strategy was in choosing the health, housing and education so-called amendment as the big bogy. It said, `This is the thing that is trying to wreck the fund.' Anyone who looks at the amendment will see that the health, housing and education amendment was turned into the bogyman when it is not. It is like the ghost in the mind of a child: it may be scary if we dream about it for too long, but when we look it in the eye, it is not scary at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Senator Evans's outline of the seven planks causing the government great distress, the point he made about Senator Harradine in this debate was a very good one. Senator Harradine is respected right around the chamber and around the nation as someone who has impeccable credentials when it comes to Aboriginal affairs issues. His support for the final Green amendment in relation to the sunset clause is testimony to those credentials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that all the coalition amendments that were supported had the support of Senator Harradine and the support of the Greens&mdash;as they had to have in order to be passed. Anyone who reviews what Senator Evans said in relation to the coalition's position and to the bill as it now stands will know that for political reasons he has had to present a stack of reasons why the government cannot live with this bill. He enumerated seven reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge all honourable senators to look at the nub of those seven issues. I am not going to go through them. If they look at the specifics of what he has mentioned, they will realise that, because of the position the government put itself in during the first few hours of this debate, he has had to create a monument to explain why the government says this bill has been destroyed. The reality is that the  coalition has listened extremely carefully to hundreds if not thousands of people who are very concerned about this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in the past few weeks a most unique if not historic amount of cooperation, discussion and consultation between some extremely unusual partners in this debate. The discussions, cooperation and consultation we have had with people such as Senator Chamarette, with people from her office and with Aboriginal groups from around the country&mdash;if they achieve nothing else&mdash;have been very positive for Aboriginal affairs discussions and for the coalition as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We listened very carefully to all of their concerns. We made a genuine attempt to make this bill more reflective of not only the hopes and aspirations of Aboriginal people but also the hopes and aspirations of people across Australia. Frankly, if one wants to be honest about this, the way that this debate has been handled, particularly in the Senate, is probably a very genuine step in the process of reconciliation, even though I see that the chairperson of ATSIC has said that it is a step backwards in that respect. That is simply not true. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the paddle-pop sticks that Senator Evans has created in his monument as to why this bill, in his words, has been made unworkable, one just has to pick item four he raised, and that was in relation to consultation with traditional owners. It is absurd that the ILC would go to a place and seek to buy some land and not seek out the traditional owners and find their views. For the government to say, `This is one of the fundamental reasons why we cannot live with the bill as it is now amended', really shows what an absurd position that is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategies issue, the $3 million extra funding that the Senate has requested from the government to fund the administration and to ensure that the moneys available for land acquisition and land management stay intact&mdash;if that is the paddle-pop stick that Senator Evans wants to build his monument out of, his monument as to why this bill is now unworkable from the government's perspective, then he really should find some more solid foundations to that monument because that really is just a paddle-pop stick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those involved in the coalition have, from the very outset, been genuine about this. Anyone who knows the coalition knows that it is very much a broad church when it comes to these issues. We came out from day one and said that we would seek to amend this legislation based on some principles. In one line, that principle is to ensure that the people at whom the legislation is directed are the people who are assisted. It is very  much based on the principle that we should empower people back at the community level, at the individual level, to ensure that the ones who do have a big stake in this have control of it and that it is not yet another Commonwealth government organisation that has its control and its power structures here in Canberra so many thousands of miles away from those people who are so disadvantaged and indeed, in the terms of this bill, so dispossessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point that Senator Evans made was that the object of the initial land fund was made very clear in the Native Title Act. Frankly, one had to have some sort of object or principle when one dealt with this act. The words in the preamble to the Native Title Act said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire that land.</PARA>
<PARA>The first amendment on the severely dispossessed, simply in an honest way, and again supported by Senator Harradine, sought to insert that principle in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans is saying that that was an unworkable principle in the Native Title Act&mdash;and that is really what he is saying; that is the principle&mdash;he is saying that the Native Title Act, when we passed that preamble back in December last year, had enshrined in that legislation an unworkable principle that would have become just as debatable in courts of law if that had proceeded under the original program which was to be set up under section 2(1) of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the coalition's view. We welcome the fact that the government will not see through its threats just to withdraw the legislation or put all the money into ATSIC. We are glad that it will be going back to the House of Representatives. If, as a result of the sort of cooperation, discussion and consultation that has taken place in the Senate&mdash;it has been a constructive debate in many areas&mdash;we can move forward and find a bill that will resolve the differences that have been thrashed out over the last 20 or 25 hours of debate, we can achieve something historic for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it will not be achieved if the coalition presents what are well-reasoned and well-argued amendments and the government slams the door. If there is going to be bipartisanship on these things, it needs to be a two-way operation. Clearly, in relation to the land fund bill, the government closed that door. Senator Evans has opened that door and we are saying that we will walk through it and we will be constructive about it&mdash;and I think we have been here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on a personal note by simply recognising the contribution to this debate that Senator Ellison in particular has made. I very much appreciated working with him on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One thing Senator Campbell forgot to say was that the reason there was more constructive cooperation was that the coalition changed a lot of its amendments, listened to the debate and made constructive contributions as a result of that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I just want to sum up briefly. There is a lot I could say but I will confine myself to this. Let us look at the checklist of what we have: we have an ILC with specified objects and principles. That is a good thing. But we have an ILC which will grant land or money for maintenance of land to Aboriginal people, including individuals, according to the criteria of most severely dispossessed, which is contestable in the courts. That is a very difficult thing. We have land which can then be sold, thereby depleting the land base, which is the very purpose of this bill. It is called a land fund bill. That is why I personally think that is very difficult as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have land which has attached to it what ought to be, and what in fact are for any other Australian citizens, automatic citizenship rights. We have extensive layers of consultation in the preparation of nearly everything the Indigenous Land Corporation has to do. I can live with that. We have a diminution of the power of government and ATSIC. This lack of confidence in ATSIC is very sad. We have had extensive debate previously in this place on ATSIC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a fund which is generally agreed probably does not have enough money but there is at least a top-up amendment which says that, on the government's model, the government will have to deliver on its promise of the model's being self-sustaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from some of those details, we have had a competition of philosophies here. I cannot subscribe to the world view that governments and all government agencies are intrinsically evil or, at the very least, ill-intentioned. I do not subscribe to the view that we will never revisit the debate about land rights and dispossession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the most unedifying thing about this debate has been the selective championing of groups of Aboriginal people either monolithically on the one hand or very selectively without actually delineating for whom we are speaking, and then a pretence that some groups' views have some right to superiority over others. There has been an unwillingness in here, really, to accept the representative nature of ATSIC. The division that we now see in Aboriginal society is a poor reflection of the way we have conducted that part of the debate, and perhaps we can come back to that at another stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen a lot of romantic rubbish written about what has gone on in here. I cannot let this pass: this is Margo Kingston in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on 12 November, and I only point to two little sections. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Greens' insistence on real self-determination clicked with the Liberals' libertarianism. Both sides hate big, centralist bureaucracy. Both believe in devolution of power to communities. . . or individuals (the Liberals).</PARA>
<PARA>Sure! I can really believe that when I look at the Liberal policy processes, the Liberal formulation&mdash;very individual based! I am really convinced when I see the way the Liberals exercise individual conscience votes on matters such as the sexual conduct bill. So the Liberals have a long way to go till they convince me that there is any pretence of libertarianism in this debate at all. It is just very convenient. However, Margo Kingston goes on to say at the end:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition can now never return to its paternalistic roots on Aboriginal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>That might be the price those opposite have paid for the sort of debate we have had here. If it is, then maybe it was worth having. But we might just keep our eyes on Senate estimates during the next few days to see the sort of scrutiny and principles that they apply to areas of Aboriginal spending&mdash;having regard to the way we have seen it before. The price we might be paying for their leaving behind their paternalistic roots might well be an unworkable bill which defeats the purpose of setting up a land fund. I just wonder whether Aboriginal people, monolithically or individually, think that that is a price worth paying. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has given very mature consideration to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. In fact, the Senate has spent 27 hours and 30 minutes considering the bill in its second reading stage and in the committee stage. There have been, as has been indicated, 50 amendments and one request that have been adopted by the Committee of the Whole. This time is in addition to the time that was spent by the Senate committee when it gave consideration to the legislation. So no one can say that this matter has not been dealt with with the seriousness and the thoughtfulness that was required.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the debate was extraordinary in this sense&mdash;that senators were actually giving their full reasons for the amendments and either voting for them or against them. Support was advanced for them by the proposers of the amendment and reasons for not supporting them were advanced by the opponents of the amendment. Persons could then take a considered view. Of course, I had a view before I came into the chamber. Some of the things I ticked I eventually did not support. I did not support all the opposition's or the Greens' amendments but I did support the bulk of them because they had that common thread. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) for what he said about me.

I do not know of anybody here, particularly those who have been involved intimately in this debate&mdash;half a dozen senators have been here practically for all of those 27 hours and 30 minutes&mdash;who could be accused of not having a deep commitment to the rights and wellbeing of Australia's indigenous people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that the Senate would be given an opportunity to consider the legislation again.

Now is not the time&mdash;it is not the third reading stage; there is no third reading stage because there is a request&mdash;to rehash all the arguments. There will be another time for that.

<PARA>The government has reached agreement with the opposition and the Australian Democrats on this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly in respect of the sales tax issue, the government, to facilitate the passage of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994, has decided to move the amendment. I understand it has been circulated to honourable senators. The amendment will allow repairers of goods to claim a sales tax credit on new parts used in the repair of second-hand goods, provided the repaired goods are then sold to always exempt persons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The related credit ground will have only prospective effect, which is a very important aspect to the government. It will only apply to goods where the repair takes place on or after royal assent of the bill. The credit ground will also ensure that the repairer will only be entitled to the credit where the tax borne on the new parts has not been passed on to the always exempt person. This credit ground is similar to that contained in the bill for export authorisation goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government considers that the amendment adequately addresses the concerns expressed in this chamber by opposition and Democrat senators, and also Senator Margetts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendment just moved by the government is welcomed by the coalition. It is a significant concession by the government on the issue of sales tax liability of the parts used to remanufacture goods bought by always exempt users. While the amendment is a significant concession, it does not extend as far as the coalition's original amendment. It will only offer a sales tax credit from the date that the bill receives assent&mdash;this was always our intent&mdash;and where remanufactured goods are bought by exempt users.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from this amendment, imported remanufactured goods will no longer be at a sales tax and, therefore, a price advantage compared with locally produced goods purchased for cash. I think it is unfortunate that the government was not willing to agree to extend the sales tax credit situation to exempt users in respect of lease remanufactured goods. But, on a positive note, at least some agreement and progress has been made. It has been made, I suppose, along lines similar to those arising from an amendment last year in relation to mining and agricultural goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment will provide the burgeoning remanufacturing industry with a degree of encouragement. The amendments are also environmentally friendly by encouraging the purchase by exempt users of remanufactured goods. I think I have to perhaps acknowledge the interest of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) when he discovered the environmental aspects of this legislation. The amendment will assist with local employment, meet the increasingly responsible recycling agenda within Australia and correct an anomaly that was previously in favour of imported goods and worked very much against Australian goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like the Senate to note that the original coalition amendment would have also had the additional beneficial effect of rectifying another anomaly in sales tax legislation, which currently exists to deny farmers who lease remanufactured farm machinery a sales tax credit on the parts used in that remanufacture. I have drawn this anomaly to the Senate's attention before, and the fact that it is penalising farmers who opt to acquire equipment through leasing arrangements, I think, is somewhat unfortunate. Again, I ask that the tax office and Treasury reconsider this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that, in times of coming out of the severe drought, the New South Wales Farmers Association in a recent press release said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is imperative the anomaly is addressed because of the expected high rate of leasing of reconditioned farm equipment once the drought breaks. Few farmers will be able to afford to buy secondhand equipment let alone new machinery. The most likely option for farmers will be to lease reconditioned equipment.</PARA>
<PARA>That would have been a secondary benefit that would have flowed from our amendment in relation to the remanufactured goods to always exempt users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to reiterate that it is simply unfair that farmers who purchase remanufactured farm machinery for cash get a sales tax credit on parts used in remanufacture but those who lease the goods do not. Discrimination on the basis of method of acquisition is not only a significant variation from the pre-streamlined sales tax position but also a major distortion to the financing decision by farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a very positive note, I believe there is some work being done by Treasury and tax in relation to this issue, and maybe something positive may come out of it in terms of the government's package. Again, I urge the government to give serious consideration to this anomaly. In relation to what has been achieved so far, I thank the government for picking up the thrust of our amendment and expressing as its own terms. I have no problem with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the officers from the office of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), Treasury, the Australian Taxation Office and also Mr Neil Olesen, who cooperated very closely but very firmly on this whole matter. I think it is an outcome where we are certainly making considerable progress, but in relation to the leasing aspect there is perhaps some way to go in the future, not only in the relation to the sales tax on the parts used to remanufacture goods for lease to exempt users, but also to the sales tax on the parts used to recycle farm machinery leased to farmers. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendment that I have circulated is being moved jointly by the coalition and the Democrats as a compromise to facilitate the passage of this bill so that the home child-care allowance can be properly implemented and some of the confusion surrounding the HCCA reduced. I will speak briefly on this because the coalition's concerns were covered exhaustively in the second reading of this bill and the subsequent debate in the committee of the whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply want to reiterate what the coalition has said from the outset: that thousands of families will be worse off when the government moves them from the dependent spouse rebate, under the taxation regime, to the home child-care allowance, under the Department of Social Security. I stress that the coalition supports the concept of the home child-care allowance. From the outset, we acknowledged the real benefits that derive from recognising the contribution of those parents caring for children at home by paying an allowance directly to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the coalition has had grave concerns from the beginning that families would be worse off as a result of the government's legislation. When this was first mooted, one of my staff, with help from the library, systematically searched for which families would be worse off. That search produced a quite exhaustive list of the differences made to various families, depending on whether they were on the dependent spouse rebate at the with or without child rate or on the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes that are being made jointly by the coalition and the Democrats will mean that families will be able to continue to claim the with child rate of the dependent spouse rebate at the end of the financial year and deduct any HCCA they have received. This will mean that they will receive a top up if they are worse off with the HCCA. Families will have access to the with child DSR even if they have qualified for HCCA but not claimed it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The compromise is that the with child rate of the DSR will not be indexed, so that over time&mdash;approximately six years&mdash;the rate of the indexed without child DSR will surpass the frozen rate of the with child DSR, effectively ending the dual system. The residual system will still exist, whereby those who may be worse off under the HCCA rules compared with DSR could continue to get the DSR level of assistance. However, as the relative value of the with child DSR declines, there will be an increasing incentive to obtain the HCCA because the HCCA rate will be higher and will be available fortnightly. From the coalition's point of view this is not the ideal solution to the legislation's defects. However, as I said, it is a compromise which hopefully will reduce some of the confusion surrounding the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of confusion out there in the community amongst those eligible for HCCA. For example, many people believed that they would retain their with child spouse rebate while getting the home child-care allowance. As a result of that confusion, many employees have continued to take their DSR during the year while their spouses have been claiming the HCCA. These people will have to find the money to repay this double dipping at the end of the financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has admitted that it has totally botched the implementation of this allowance. In a recent media release, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, admitted that many taxpayers may face an unexpected tax bill at the end of this financial year because of the confusion surrounding the HCCA. There are many families who are not in a position to afford that and who are in for a shock. I remind the chamber that when we first debated this matter Senator Harradine said over and over again that there would be a problem with this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The widespread confusion which has beset the HCCA could have been avoided if the government had allocated resources to informing families of the abolition of the with child dependent spouse rebate equal to those used in promoting the introduction of the home child-care allowance. I suppose the government does not want to tell people the bad news&mdash;that it is taking one thing from them without giving them another&mdash;it only wants to tell them the good news, and that is where the confusion arises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the government has attempted to blame the opposition for the bungling associated with the HCCA, claiming that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The confusion is being unnecessarily fuelled and extended by the Opposition and the Democrats.</PARA>
<PARA>I refute that. I refuse to accept it. I think that is absolutely appalling. The government should have got the legislation right in the first place. For it to turn around and blame the coalition and the Democrats is totally unacceptable. This is the government's legislation. It was not workable from the beginning and it has left many families worse off. Now the government has the hide to turn around and blame the coalition and the Democrats. That is rich!</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance, as I have previously stated, was conceived not out of a genuine concern for families or for those who care for children at home, but out of the basest desire to win votes at an election. The HCCA was Mr Keating's key election policy commitment to women. His pledge during his campaign launch was `this allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace.' That was nothing short of a cunning deception.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning the home child-care allowance was a policy conceived with deliberate deception, flawed in its original drafting and implemented with incompetence, trickery and bungling. The bottom line is that despite Mr Keating's promise that the HCCA would be `more generous' than the benefit it replaced, that will not be so for thousands of families. The changes that are being made jointly by the coalition and the Democrats will partly alleviate this situation because families will be able to continue to claim the with child rate of the dependent spouse rebate, although the with child rebate will not be indexed and will be claimable only at the end of the financial year. </PARA>

The amendment achieves our dual objectives of ensuring that no family is worse off this year because of the cashing out of the DSR and its replacement with the HCCA; and providing a substantial and increasing incentive from 1995-96 onwards to transfer from the rebate system to the allowance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to go over this debate again; we have had this debate already. But I do remind the government that the HCCA proposal, as has already been pointed out by me and others, contains serious anomalies whereby many families would suffer and not gain in shifting from the dependent spouse rebate to the HCCA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, families moving overseas for a temporary period would still be subject to Australian tax but would lose the HCCA after 13 weeks. The DSS definition of income is broader than the taxation concept of income. In fact, tax agents gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public administration of the difficulties with the HCCA scheme. It was said, for example, that a woman might have to file 26 claim forms a year for the HCCA if her income fluctuates above the $10.88 per fortnight. Now that these anomalies have finally sunk in, the government has changed its mind and has decided to retain the spouse rebate but only at the without child rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a compromise, and I suppose that is something, but the compromise involves the freezing of the spouse rebate at the current with child level with no indexation. As Senator Lees has indicated, in about six years time, those claiming the DSR instead of the HCCA will get the without child DSR. In other words, in six years time those caught by the HCCA changeover anomalies will get nothing from the tax system or HCCA for their children. They will be treated as though they have none. That is economic blackmail pure and simple. The proposal before us would also stop employees with children from claiming PAYE instalment variations to take account of the DSR. Employees with spouses and no children will continue to get tax instalment deductions varied to take account of the DSR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to HCCA from DSR is an administrative bungle of the first order. Hundreds of thousands of one-income families are having their financial privacy invaded for a measly $2.60 a fortnight. As Senator Patterson indicated, they thought they were getting another $30 in addition to what they had already. It may be an unintended deception, but it was a deception on the part of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DSS is not even administering the law correctly. I put it to the committee, and to the parliamentary secretary particularly, that thousands of self-employed spouses are being denied their entitlement. HCCA is legally based on fortnightly income of the spouse, yet the Department of Social Security told the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration at its meeting on 19 September that for the self-employed it is working on a previous year's taxable income. Mr Tune made that comment in answer to a question by Senator Watson. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>Where is the legal basis for this administration? There is none. That is a very important question that just has not been answered. I ask the parliamentary secretary to please tell us now where the legal basis for that statement of Mr Tune is. There is none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another aspect, and I raised this previously. Gifts are included as income in the DSS definition, as distinct, of course, from what happened with DSR. I ask the minister how this is applied to an individual unit instead of a married couple income unit when we look at gifts from one spouse to another. The minister has not produced any legal advice on this obviously unintended consequence. But I have had the matter looked at, and a gift from a husband to wife, for example, technically means that her claim to HCCA should be reduced. Technically that is the situation. That is ludicrous, is it not?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many workers just give their pay packets to their wives. Theoretically and technically that excludes her from receiving HCCA. There would be a riot if it actually happened, but that is the technical situation. The minister should look at those questions seriously and perhaps should, in the upcoming estimates, give us some responses. Ultimately, I believe the legislation will have to be duly amended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, the government has agreed to support the amendment moved jointly by Senator Patterson and Senator Lees. Senator Lees was not able to be here today and Senator Woodley spoke in her place. The amendment will deliver the government's preferred position, but over a period of five to six years. At that point, the indexed with-child dependent spouse rebate will be less than the indexed without-child dependent spouse rebate.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Regulations prescribe the standards that apply to the operation of superannuation entities, that is: regulated superannuation funds, approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation trusts. Those standards currently relate to a variety of issues such as the provision of information to members and other persons, the management and trusteeship of superannuation entities, matters associated with public offer entities, the financial management of funds, eligible rollover benefits and many other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report, Super Regs II, is the second of two reports of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on the regulations relating to superannuation. The first, Super Regs I, which examined the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Regulations, was tabled on 29 August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the inquiry resulting in this report, Super Regs II, the committee sought to find remedies to some of the more technical policy problems which have arisen since the SIS framework was established. The recommendations aim to fine tune the operation of the regulations and in some important measures, to make it more consumer-friendly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Report</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of member investment choice, more accurately referred to in the report as beneficiary investment choice, was the subject of more evidence and submissions than any other feature of the SIS regulations. The committee makes three recommendations concerning member investment choice, the most important one recommending that, member investment choice become mandatory for all standard employer-sponsored funds with more than 50 members. This, however, must be phased in over a period of, say, five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee considered that the intervening period would allow the education campaign conducted by the Australian Tax Office with the assistance of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission, various other agencies and the private sector interests to educate the community into the consumer elements of superannuation. The committee recommended that member investment choice be made a component of this education campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee also considered that the intervening period until member investment choice is mandated could be usefully employed by superannuation funds to upgrade their administrative and technological capacities to cope with the additional demands that would be placed on their operational systems by the introduction of member investment choice. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of widespread community demand for member investment choice, the committee has been proactive in recommending the eventual introduction of mandatory member investment choice for a number of reasons. These are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to promote competition between funds;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to enhance consumer understanding of superannuation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iii)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to empower individuals who are compulsory members of funds to influence their superannuation arrangements and provide them with an increased sense of ownership of their superannuation balances, thereby assisting them in achieving the objectives of self provision in the Government's retirement incomes policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee also believes that choice of fund would promote these objectives, but has refrained from making recommendations about mandating choice of fund membership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has recommended that the current standards under the SIS regulations governing member investment choice be relaxed to allow trustees to formulate individual investment strategies on the condition that they are consistent with the overall investment strategy of the fund affected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other recommendations made by the committee in this report include recommendations that the Government:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">review, and if necessary, move to limit the extent of exposure of superannuation funds to derivatives transactions;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">review and remedy any unnecessary constraints on the legitimate investment activities of superannuation entities</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reconcile the conflict between the sole purpose test under SIS and the recovery of Commonwealth debts;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amend the definition of `member' to include pensioners and deferred beneficiaries;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">amend the definition of `beneficiary' to allow full access to funds' internal complaints mechanisms and the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">fine tune some of the disclosure requirements;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">review the rules concerning small funds with non-arms length members;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reduce the presumed age of retirement;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">refer a number of other technical problems to the ISC for resolution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Super Regs II reports to the Senate the evidence presented in relation to an arrangement struck between the AWU/FIME and the administrators of the Nationwide Superannuation Fund, whereby the union received 20% of the administration fee levied by the fund in return for marketing the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee accepts the advice by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer that it was not uncommon for administrators to enter into agreements with third parties for promotion of a particular superannuation product. The only unusual feature of this arrangement was that it was a union that was the third party.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>The main point I would like to make about the Joint Coal Board's 47th annual report 1993-94 is in relation to pages 24 and 25. Although there is not an actual page or section dealing with the environment in this report, this particular section is called `International training'. What narks me most of all is that we have Australian International Development Assistance Bureau aid going through as environmental aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why that gets me is that we are talking about Australia using the latest coal technology in the developing world to enable them to lessen their dependence on imported oil and substitute this with lower-cost coal as a principal power generation and industrial energy input to their economies. At the same time, these countries are encouraged to `protect their environment' through the use of clean coal combustion technology developed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we consider the debate in the media and in this chamber in recent times in relation to Australia's inability to meet its greenhouse commitments, it is outrageous in the extreme that Australia is giving aid as environmental aid in order to have access to markets to sell more Australian coal. This is not just an interpretation. The last paragraph on page 25 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australia can continue to contribute to this economic development while at the same time ensuring that the vast quantities of coal which will be consumed are produced and utilised in an environmentally responsible manner, we will have made a contribution to the economic and social advancement of the developing world.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all about selling more Australian coal and replacing another fuel source, oil, with one that actually contributes in a greater amount to the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Some people said at various times during the debates on this particular issue, `Oh, it is about replacing dirty coal technology with cleaner coal.' It specifically says that it is about replacing oil with coal. The only thing that is perhaps cleaner about this is that it might be a lower sulphur coal. That is not to do with greenhouse gas emissions, and I am pleased to say that they have not attempted to pass this off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder about the actual commitment of the Australian government, through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, to international environment when it tries to pass off this nonsense as environmental aid. Yes, it might have something to do with reducing sulphur emissions if it was a matter of choosing between Australian coal, with or without the sulphur scrubbers or without the particular process, but we are not even talking about the best available technology for CO2 reduction. We do not even use that in Australia. We are not using that for the proposed Collie power station. The reason we are not using it is that it adds something like 25 per cent onto the price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we were to produce coal in the manner that is being used in other places in the world as best available technology, it would be rejected in Australia. That is the real cost of producing coal technology. The real cost is producing it in a way that reduces the CO2 emissions to a considerable extent. If we are not doing that because it is too expensive and because it makes other methods of power financially more attractive, then what the heck are we doing? How can we hold our head up in the world and say we are doing the best for the environment when we are using precious aid resources and calling it environmental aid? I think it is a disgrace.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The first point that I wish to make in the context of the ADI report is to express my concern about the very late tabling of this report. Given the new estimates process this year, these annual reports are really all that is left to enable a proper examination of the activities of government departments and associated organisations. Yesterday we had the ludicrous situation in which we were being asked to examine the activities of the Department of Defence in the Estimates Committee without having access to the ADI annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year among the highlights outlined in the report is the signing of a joint venture agreement with Lend Lease for the development of the property at St Marys in Sydney. This site is currently used to store miscellaneous nuclear waste which the government was suddenly so anxious to move, so much so that it drafted regulations allowing virtually open slather in relation to the removal and transport of nuclear waste under the ANSTO Act. It is interesting to note that ADI is already exempt from state and other regulations under section 122A of the Defence Act in a similar manner to the exemptions available to ANSTO under the ANSTO Amendment Act 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concerns about this issue have already been placed on the record. ADI is also selling off properties in Maribyrnong and Footscray in Melbourne, and in Canberra as part of its restructuring. It will build a new munitions factory at Benalla in Victoria. I note that there is a Victorian inquiry into these plants, and their failure to abide by Victorian environmental regulations, as a consequence of section 122A(2)(a)(ii) which exempts ADI from `the environmental consequences of the use of land or premises,' and under 122A(1)(c) extends that exemption to `any act or thing done by or on behalf of ADI' under state or territory laws. This means that this exemption applies to any company planning links to ADI in this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our understanding that ADI has actually decided to clear up the mess, at least to its own satisfaction, because it wants to sell off this property. It is well located, the economy has picked up, and it should make a good return. So it is with a sense of irony that I read on page 26 that ADI has now developed an environmental service component which it is actively marketing. I also wonder where the profits from these sales will go. How much will be returned to consolidated revenue and how much will go to defence or be rolled back into ADI to make its suggested sale more attractive?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to make a few comments about the new Minehunter MHC program. I note that the last Minehunter program, the MHI program, was a disaster. It was poorly thought out and poorly planned from beginning to end. After $150 million was spent to produce two boats that basically could not be used in more than a gentle breeze, the Joint House FADAT committee delivered a report damning the project and it was abandoned. This one seems a bit better, but there remain a number of serious problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The MHCs are relatively standard hulls and will probably handle a swell a little better than the MHI. I note that one of the major failings of the MHI, apart from the fact that the thing could not go out in waves, was that Defence demanded the latest high-tech sonars that did not work. They have repeated that mistake in the MHC. It has planned the use of very expensive Raytheon sonars that can be dropped to various levels below the ship. These are used in the Baltic where there is relatively little ocean temperature variation, unlike Australia. They have never been used in this sort of environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they do not work, efforts to make them work will prove exceedingly expensive, and there is little justification in having them, given the location of our submarine bases, the existing intelligence networks on mines, and the lack of any threat of the kinds of mines this system is designed to detect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also another example of setting up an industry from scratch under ADI. This practice has added $220 million to the cost of each Collins submarine and Anzac frigate we buy. Whilst I acknowledge that this has provided employment, it seems to be heavily subsidised employment. The MHC hull is simple. Certainly there are shipyards in existence that can build them. I believe this is just another example of wanting a guaranteed contract to make subsequent sale of an asset more attractive. It is a practice the taxpayer pays for and which does nothing for defence. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address this evening the presentation of annual reports. I would like to congratulate the departments which tabled their annual reports prior to the deadline of 31 October 1994. The setting of the deadline meant that information contained within the annual reports would enable parliamentarians, in particular those senators involved in the Senate estimates process, to make informed judgments about the effectiveness of any one department in meeting its program objectives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the revisions introduced to facilitate scrutiny by the Senate of departments, the annual reports are now key accountability documents for reviewing departmental outcomes for the previous financial year. On 17 March 1994, the Joint Committee of Public Accounts agreed with the proposal put forward by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet to significantly reduce the number of detailed requirements on which departments must report in their annual reports. However, this came with the proviso that there would be no diminution in the information available to members and senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Departments must continue to maintain information previously available in the annual reports and, furthermore, to provide this information on request. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance were instrumental in implementing these revisions to the accountability process. Where such information is not included in the annual reports, it was agreed that it must be made available on request to members and senators and members of the public, once the report has been tabled. The Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's own guidelines outline that the information should be provided to the person requesting the information within five working days of the day of the request. I quote from a letter to the secretaries to departments from Bill Blick, First Assistant Secretary, Government Division, Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, in which he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time frame for the provision of this information has been set at five working days from the date of the request after annual reports have been tabled. This arrangement would be the subject to any negotiation between departments and the Member of Parliament or Senator making the request. If the requester wants the information no later than five days after the request, departments do not have the discretion to extend the deadline without agreement from the requester.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth authorities whose operations are similar to those of departments should consult these revised requirements and comply with them.</PARA>
<PARA>What I am most concerned about is the breach encountered by many senators' offices in obtaining information previously available in the annual reports. This concerns not only breaches of the guidelines but difficulties experienced by senators' offices in obtaining the relevant information previously available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is of greater concern is the breach of these rules by the very department instrumental in establishing these guidelines&mdash;none other than the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. The department has been generous in providing to my office a number of explanations, after the expiry of five working days, as to why certain information was yet to be provided to my office. The information requested finally emerged some seven working days after the initial request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that this is a very embarrassing position for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to be in. And if the department is not embarrassed, then it ought to be embarrassed. The department instrumental in obtaining permission from the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to revise annual report requirements is now one of the first departments to breach its own guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also had problems obtaining information from the Department of Administrative Services. This department failed to respond to telephone calls when a initial request for information as made on Monday, 7 November 1994. When the request was finally recognised on Tuesday, 8 November, my office was informed that the person who was normally assigned to the task of distribution of the additional information was on sick leave for some three weeks. Naturally, I have not received the information requested from the Department of Administrative Services within the five working day deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not begrudge anyone sick leave. However, the rules as agreed by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are in place. There is something fundamentally wrong with the operations of a department of over 7,800 public servants if it is unable to provide me with the information requested within the required time frame just because one person is on sick leave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office and, I believe, a number of other senators' offices, in requesting this information from various departments, have been provided with a number of excuses by officers of those departments as to why information previously available in the annual reports is not available and may not be available on request. Excuses range from department staff on sick leave to no understanding of the new requirements, and from provision of inaccurate and incomplete information to information which should be provided under these new provisions not being listed in the annual report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What guarantees will be provided to parliamentarians that they will receive requested information when the very department which established these guidelines cannot abide by the rules? That, I submit, is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliament, in particular the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts, has been generous to lessen the rigorous reporting requirements for annual reports. I have no doubt that the joint committee did this with reservations and concerns about the potential for departments to abuse the guidelines. The saying `Give a yardstick to the department and it will take a mile' seems to be ringing loud and clear as a result of these changes to reporting requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind all departments that non-compliance with the provision of the information is a breach of the undertakings and guarantees provided by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance to the clerks of the Senate, members of parliament and senators. It is regrettable that their word is not their bond, even when their word has been provided in writing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that the excuses provided by departments and the non-compliance of the guidelines are only as a result of teething problems faced by the changes to the reporting requirements. There are some very good reasons for the annual reports to be more user friendly and more cost effective. However, I am opposed to this if the result for parliamentarians is a reduced ability to scrutinise the effectiveness of departmental program objectives. The scrutiny and accountability of all government departments and their administration are matters of importance to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about a matter which I think is of very serious concern and should be of serious concern to the Senate and indeed to the parliament. It relates to what seems to be blatant interference by a member of parliament in commercial arrangements between a government body&mdash;namely, the CSIRO&mdash;and a company known as Bridlewood Pty Ltd, which is owned by Mr David Battersby and his wife of Modbury Heights in South Australia. The member of parliament in question is Mrs Chris Gallus, who is the member for Hindmarsh in South Australia. Her actions, on the basis of the information provided to me and what I have been able to ascertain as a result of my own investigations, have placed Bridlewood and Mr Battersby and his family in a position where they are confronted with substantial financial losses for expenses incurred and may be sued for damages, all of which could force them into bankruptcy through no fault of their own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Battersby, who is a small business person, is only young&mdash;he is 31. He and his wife have three children aged two, five and seven. Mr Battersby and his wife run a small carpet laying business and endeavoured, through the course of a process, to enter into advertising. As part of that process, Mr Battersby contacted the CSIRO in relation to property that the CSIRO owns in South Australia with a view to putting up advertising billboards on that property. Mr Battersby sent a proposal to a Mr Kevin Howard, who is the business manager of the human nutrition business enterprise of the CSIRO at Glenthorne. That was on 21 May of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About mid-June Mr Howard rang Mr Battersby and agreed that the CSIRO, or certainly the human nutrition operation, was interested in the proposal and sought to meet with Mr Battersby to look at the type of signs that he proposed to put up at the site and to look at signs that Mr Battersby already had up at Parafield airport. They travelled to the airport and inspected the signs. Mr Battersby gave Mr Howard a copy of the contract that was used between him and the FAC for the putting up of signs on the FAC property. Mr Howard indicated that any process of commercial arrangement would have to be approved by the corporate services division of the CSIRO in Canberra, and that process was ultimately entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 July Mr Battersby received a draft copy of an agreement proposed to be entered into between the CSIRO and David Battersby and Bridlewood. He requested on 13 July two minor changes, and both were agreed to. He received three copies on 29 July of a contract for signing by both him and his wife, and they did so. They then proceeded to go through the process of making this proposal become a reality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once having got the original contract signed by the manager of the corporate services division, Mr Battersby entered into an arrangement with a company to start making the billboards. He also employed the services of a company to conduct soil tests so that the foundations and so on could be put in for those billboards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of that went along very well until such time&mdash;it was around September of this year&mdash;as a Mr Mike Patchell of the corporate services division phoned Mr Battersby, saying that Chris Gallus was causing a lot of problems and that some other advertising companies had been ringing up. He indicated to Mr Battersby that if the development and everything else was done legally and properly he had no worry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Battersby rang Chris Gallus to ask her what the problem was. By all accounts, Chris Gallus said to Mr Battersby that the project was dead; that he should get a good lawyer; and that, whilst she did not like to see anyone go bankrupt, from where she sat, he was going to go under, and he was playing in the big league now. Mr Battersby had never been officially advised by the CSIRO that the contract was over. Indeed, he received other information from the manager of another advertising company that he had heard from a competitor that the project was dead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This really brings into question why Chris Gallus got involved in this and what her interest was. It is not in Chris Gallus's electorate. Certainly, the Glenthorne property is in Kingston, and Chris Gallus is the member for Hindmarsh. If you look at what Chris Gallus did prior to entering parliament it might throw some light on the question of why she got involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Colston)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;I do not like to interrupt, but I would ask you to refer to the member as Mrs Gallus. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry; I do apologise. If we were to look at her CV, we would see that she was an advertising executive&mdash;I do not know for which company. But one would have to assume, as I said, on the basis of the information I have from my own investigations, that Mrs Gallus rang up on behalf of another advertising company. It seems that the real reason behind Mrs Gallus's intervention was that another advertising company felt that the price that Mr Battersby had entered into to pay rent for putting the signs up was insufficient. Yet he had done everything in accordance with the law. He had entered into a commercial arrangement, but it just so happened that other people did not like it. Therefore, Mrs Gallus apparently chose to intervene.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened thereafter was that Mr Battersby did receive a call from a Mike Patchell of CSIRO, who said, `The contract is over.' Yet it was a signed contract, copies of which I have. Mr Battersby had not received any written confirmation of that and, to this day, has not received any written confirmation of that. Quite clearly, the only reason that I can ascertain for the contract being terminated&mdash;and I have spoken to CSIRO officers and other people&mdash;although it has never been put in writing to that effect, is because Mrs Gallus intervened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, Mr Battersby is confronted with very severe financial losses. I do not think it is appropriate for a member of parliament to act in this way. It appears that there was no good reason&mdash;and certainly Mr Battersby has been given no valid reason&mdash;as to why this actually happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I intend to continue to pursue this issue but. As well I have written to the minister responsible for CSIRO and asked him to investigate the actions of CSIRO in this matter. I do not think that CSIRO's action with regard to the termination of the contract can go unnoticed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, this is a very sad and sorry event. This person has no capacity to meet the costs of some $70,000 that he has outlaid and has no capacity to meet the possibility of being sued for a substantial amount of money for contracts that he sought to let for the placing of advertising. For instance, Channel Seven had entered into a contract with an advertising firm for placing an advertisement on one of those billboards for the next 12 months to the tune of about $60,000. As I said earlier, under the circumstances, this is not the sort of behaviour we would expect of a member of parliament, certainly, I would think, not something we would expect from a conservative member of parliament who purports to stand up for small business in this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA), which owns and operates Commonwealth lighthouses, currently has 15 properties in New South Wales listed for disposal.

The Government has considered the request of the Premier, but has decided that it could not agree to transfer the properties at no charge. The Government is, however, prepared to offer some assistance to the NSW Government in the purchase of these properties. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport wrote to the Premier of NSW in early October 1994 offering the properties for sale for $3.536m and offering a grant of $0.275m to cover transaction costs and remedial repair work.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) has recently completed the construction of a new laboratory complex on the Agropolis International Campus at Montpellier. The laboratory was officially opened by the Hon Barry Jones, MP on 10 October 1994. The new laboratory provides better facilities to support the research of the Division of Entomology, which has been present at the site since 1966 but in rented accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Montpellier is an internationally recognised site for research into biological control of weeds and insect pests with climatic similarities to Australia which enables field testing prior to importation of control agents into Australia. One successful outcome from Montpellier was the introduction of a rust disease to control skeleton weed in wheat farming systems in the early 1970s which has saved the industry hundreds of millions of dollars. Current projects include collaborative projects with State Departments of Agriculture in Victoria and New South Wales. Following the establishment of the CSIRO new laboratory, the US Department of Agriculture has decided to move laboratories from Paris and Rome to Montpellier and the French National Institute for Agricultural Research (INRA) is also consolidating on the site, providing excellent opportunities for collaborative projects of benefit to Australia.</PARA>
