<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased to table the report of the Senate Employment, Education and Training References Committee on the development of open learning in Australia. When the inquiry was first referred to the committee, the Commonwealth government's open learning initiative was a prominent feature of debate in higher education circles. The OLI had been announced in the 1992-93 budget and the pilot project, TV open learning, was still running its course. But the committee was aware that much was happening in open learning not only in the university sector but in TAFE and schools as well. The committee was faced with a substantial task. In order to address the issues raised, the committee is in fact presenting to the Senate two reports, of which this is the first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This first report looks at the role played by the Open Learning Agency of Australia, the Open Learning Technology Corporation and the more recently established Open Learning Electronic Support Service which is operated by the other two agencies. The committee believes that this first report will provide valuable feedback to these agencies and will contribute significantly to both the formal and the informal evaluation processes to which they are subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In part two the committee will address the many other issues that have been raised in the course of this inquiry, including the role of distance education centres in providing open learning; the issue of credit transfer; the relationship of open learning to flexible delivery, especially in the TAFE sector; the professional development of teachers; the potential for open learning in workplace training; and the potential advantages offered by the information superhighway. Open learning has been actively promoted in recent years as a way of enhancing the access to education, especially to higher education. In part one of our report we have concentrated our attention on the open learning initiatives at the tertiary level and in particular the Open Learning Agency of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The OLAA is a private company owned by Monash University in a consortium with a number of other institutions. It was set up as a vehicle to improve access to higher education for people unable to gain entry through the conventional means of tertiary entrance score or various mature age programs. It was hoped when it was initially established that the OLAA could achieve this at minimal cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students in these programs pay $300 per unit to study through one of the participating universities. The committee believes that the Open Learning Agency of Australia should be a fully integrated component of the higher education sector. It should operate to serve the university sector as a whole. A sense of ownership is crucial to the ongoing commitment to the OLAA by our higher education institutions. So we have recommended in this report a restructuring of the agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recommend that the government enter negotiations with Monash and the AV-CC with a view to placing the Open Learning Agency of Australia under the auspices of the AV-CC. In that way, it should have an assured broad base of support across the whole university sector. It is also extremely important in terms of facilitating credit transfer between universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is also concerned that the funding attached to students entering higher education through the OLAA is insufficient for the universities providing the open learning courses to sustain their efforts without a severe compromise to the quality of education received by OLAA students. Either the university which is participating has to put in additional funding and resources or the lecturers provide many of these services out of the goodness of their heart. It is not really a satisfactory way to sustain an operation and it certainly is not a satisfactory way for expanding an operation in a university sector that is already strapped for resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the $310 that is provided through this OLAA mechanism, students are paying for a 13-week course but only $185 of that amount goes to the university providing the course. We have in evidence received responses from universities that indicate that only about $100 of it actually finds its way back to the teaching faculty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence that we have received has made it abundantly clear that this is nowhere near enough to meet the costs of providing a quality course, let alone the student back-up and library support that normally goes along with study at a tertiary level. Universities are cross-subsidising the OLAA because they believe that it is important for them to be involved in open learning programs. But for the $185 per unit they simply cannot keep up the standard of provision necessary, particularly for the large number of students who are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this system continues, it would have major implications for the degree status of those who graduate through open learning programs. We have, therefore, recommended that the government provide funds equivalent to 50 per cent of the EFTSU for students entering the system through the Open Learning Agency of Australia. This will enable them to provide universities to teach these students properly and to maintain the standards of courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international perspective is also an important one to keep in mind. The OLAA has the potential to serve Australia's interests in the global education market&mdash;all the more reason for integrating the OLAA properly into our national university system and ensuring the quality of its services are backed by adequate funding. The broadcasting of educational television programs into South-East Asia is bound to create even greater demand for our courses, and we must be in a position to meet that demand with a quality product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the OLAA is concerned with access to higher education by people who would otherwise face significant impediments to further study, we also want to see equitable arrangements in place for the payment of fees. We have recommended that the rules governing the open learning deferred payment scheme be modified to bring them into line with HECS. At present, open learning students have to study more than a 75 per cent load over more than one study period in order to have access to deferred payment provisions. This works against many of the more disadvantaged students. Students with a disability are required to take on a 75 per cent or more load, and that is particularly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is supportive of the work being done by the Open Learning Technology Corporation but is concerned that its commercial orientation might put at risk the important aspect of public benefit. This is most important at a time when the advent of the information superhighway places enormous challenges before the community and educational users.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also very conscious of the people side of the educational technology debate. Courseware must be designed with a strong focus on learning styles of students and the role of teachers as managers of learning. There must be professional training available to both course developers and teachers if the methods of open learning are to be fully effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as course development is concerned, it is most important that Australia continue to produce high quality courseware. The competition from overseas sources will be intense, and it is essential that our courses be relevant to their students and appropriate to Australian conditions and culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Open Learning Electronic Support Service&mdash;OLESS&mdash;was launched on 14 September 1994 as a $1.4 million pilot. For a fee of around $70 per open learning study unit, OLESS will provide access for students to electronic mail, bulletin board services, file transfer facilities, course information and access to some library catalogues and administrative services. The government has declared that it is prepared to commit up to $10 million towards full implementation of the service, and the committee will be monitoring that project very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would like to see such a service available to all open learning students across all education sectors. There are already many communication networks in place, and these could be linked to provide a comprehensive national education communication service. When I was in the United States about three months ago, I saw much evidence of these sorts of networks developing, particularly in states such as North Carolina, which are linking every public and educational institution by the year 2000. We need that similar visionary scheme in Australia, and OLESS, which is providing the technology and software base for open learning students, could do this and provide our students with information that will give them access to a worldwide system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of this inquiry, the committee visited a number of states and territories and witnessed the innovative applications of interactive technologies and open learning methods to a whole range of education and training needs. We spoke to course developers, teachers, trainees, administrators and policy advisers who are contributing to the development of open learning in all educational sectors. The committee was impressed with the developments and will be commenting in greater detail on these in part two of the report. I would like to commend the work of my colleagues in this committee.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend both the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and the Development Allowance Authority Act 1992. "Working Nation" announced that the date of effect would be from 1 July 1994. This has changed to the date the bill receives Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of Infrastructure Borrowings was first announced in the "One Nation" Statement on 26 February 1992. The measure was intended to encourage the private sector to make a real commitment to the provision of publicly accessible infrastructure, on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those infrastructure projects with lengthy construction periods may not produce assessable income for some years and may accumulate tax losses in the early stages of development. Therefore, where taxpayers borrow funds to finance the construction of those projects, they are often unable to access the interest deductions available to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By making interest on Infrastructure Borrowings non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower, the tax benefit of the interest deduction is transferred to the lender in the form of non-assessable interest income. This enables companies to raise funds at a lower interest rate, thus reducing the borrowings costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend the range of sectors within which projects may be eligible for Infrastructure Borrowing financing and will modify the administrative and taxation treatment of Infrastructure Borrowings. These amendments are intended to make Infrastructure Borrowings more attractive to investors and to facilitate even greater private sector provision of publicly accessible infrastructure.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existing law covering Infrastructure Borrowings is contained in Division 16L of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 and is administered by the Australian Taxation Office on behalf of the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Infrastructure Borrowings measure is not operated currently as a program with a formal approvals process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will introduce new administrative arrangements for Infrastructure Borrowings. The Development Allowance Authority will be responsible for the approvals, management and monitoring functions relating to Infrastructure Borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new administrative arrangements, prospective borrowers will need to apply to the Development Allowance Authority for eligibility to issue Infrastructure Borrowings. When the Development Allowance Authority is satisfied that the applicant has met all eligibility criteria, it will issue a certificate in relation to the borrowing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Development Allowance Authority may cancel a certificate if the conditions attached to it are breached. Where a certificate is cancelled it is proposed the certificate holder will be liable for the payment of a charge. This is designed to provide a deterrent to the borrower breaching the conditions while not penalising the lenders. The Infrastructure Certificate Cancellation Tax Bill 1994, which we are debating cognately, forms part of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with its current functions, the Development Allowance Authority will continue to work closely with the Australian Taxation Office. The Australian Taxation Office will retain responsibility for ensuring compliance with the tax laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Development Allowance Authority having responsibility for Infrastructure Borrowings will provide a single point of contact and a greater flow of information between the public and private sectors. This will enable the Infrastructure Borrowings initiative to be promoted more effectively in the business community and among the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Infrastructure Borrowings measure will operate on an on-going basis, and the Development Allowance Authority will now have the role of administering the concession, section 98 of the DAA Act, which provided that there would be no substantive appointment of the DAA on or beyond 1 January 1997, will be repealed. This, in effect, results in the Development Allowance Authority being an on-going position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">More Generous Taxation Treatment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Design of the Concession</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing treatment of Infrastructure Borrowings, interest on the borrowings is non-assessable to the lender and non-deductible to the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of this is to lower the cost of finance for certain infrastructure projects. Therefore, Infrastructure Borrowings can be issued at a lower, after-tax rate. This will be attractive, in straight price terms, to taxpayers with marginal tax rates higher than the company tax rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, tax exempt interest may not be as attractive to all lenders, for example investors with tax rates below the company tax rate such as superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providing a tax rebate instead of non-assessable interest income will help increase the attractiveness of Infrastructure Borrowings to low tax rate investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to change the design of the tax concession to provide for the option of a tax rebate of 33 per cent as an alternative to the current non-assessable income arrangement. The interest payments from Infrastructure Borrowings will continue to be non-deductible to the borrower.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Investors will be able to elect whether to treat interest as exempt or to include it in assessable income and receive a tax rebate of 33 per cent of the amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The non-assessable treatment of interest will remain attractive to investors with tax rates above the company tax rate, while the option of a rebate will make Infrastructure Borrowings attractive for taxpayers with marginal tax rates below 33 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This modification is designed to increase the pool of funds available to private sector infrastructure providers wishing to access Infrastructure Borrowings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Twenty-five year Ownership Rule</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing legislation, companies wishing to issue Infrastructure Borrowings must intend to own, operate and control the infrastructure project for at least 25 years from the time the facility becomes income producing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This requirement is intended to restrict the transfer of infrastructure projects from the private to the public sector. However, it also prevents the transfer of ownership to other private sector investors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes a relaxation of this requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of infrastructure assets will be permitted within the 25 year period where the prospective buyer is sufficiently commercial to meet the other borrower requirements for Infrastructure Borrowings. Only a body which is approved by the Development Allowance Authority will qualify as a suitable purchaser of an infrastructure facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will make the requirements more consistent with business practices, while ensuring that the infrastructure facility continues to be operated by the private sector, on a fully commercial basis for 25 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Concessional Period</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current arrangements, Infrastructure Borrowings receive concessional treatment for a maximum period of ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend the existing maximum term of ten years for the tax concession to fifteen years. However, the term of the borrowings is not restricted to fifteen years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will facilitate investment by the private sector in infrastructure projects with very long construction periods, that are expected to be in tax loss for more than ten years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Technical Amendment</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation contains an amendment to the operation of Infrastructure Borrowings additional to those announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>. This amendment is required to remove references to outdated Loan Council procedures in the existing legislation which refer to "global borrowing limits". The amendment replaces the eligibility requirement relating to the Loan Council with new guidelines designed specifically for Infrastructure Borrowings. The new guidelines are designed to determine the commerciality of government owned bodies and will be published in the Commonwealth Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that the changes proposed in the bill will increase the level of private sector investment in infrastructure. A responsible acceleration of infrastructure investment can facilitate increased competition and maximise Australia's potential for sustainable growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The estimated cost to revenue is expected to be nil for 1994-95, $9 million for 1995-96, $18 million for 1996-97 and $34 million for 1997-98.</PARA>

<PARA>Amendment 20 is the same as the amendment the Greens moved in relation to the youth training allowance. As we all know, the employment services legislation overrides anything in the youth training allowance, so it is imperative that we consider carefully this amendment and that it is supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment, we feel, rights the balance a little more fairly so that unemployed people get some negotiating rights and are not seen to be delaying the agreement or failing to agree to it if they are willing to keep negotiating until a mutual decision can be made. As it stands, clause 44(2)(b)(iii) is written in such a way that people will be cut off from their allowance for failing to agree to the case manager's agreement. This is a ludicrous situation where people have to be passive and disempowered by having to accept something that they may not want to agree to. But they have little choice or else they will be cut off from their allowance. The Greens believe that opening this up into a more two-way negotiation rather than having it one way will have better outcomes and less draconian laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like honourable senators to picture what it would be like for a person who is in this less powerful situation and who is given an agreement to sign&mdash;an agreement which, because of the lack of desire of the government and the opposition, does not specifically allow for negotiation because negotiation, we were told last night, was a dirty word that did not need to be and should not be included because it gave too much flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, considering that negotiation is not a right under this particular process, consider what choice people have when an agreement has been written up by perhaps private case managers who would like to get these people either off their books or into something to which they may or may not be suited so that they get the money back. What choice do these people have? They can say no and be cut off from their allowance, or they can say yes. Is that the choice that we are leading to? Is this what the government, the Australian Democrats, the opposition and the Greens sat down to talk about? Is this actually what we agreed to? Or has one department, as we predicted, overruled another already? Has the consequence of trying to deal with a Social Security issue and allowing DEET to overrule it already claimed its first victims&mdash;the unemployed?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Margetts indicated, this amendment goes to the heart of what this business is all about. This amendment has been the subject of considerable discussion with the government and with representatives of the departments. We believe that it brings to the entire bill a flavour of identifying what the bill is about and what the process is about. The subheading on page 27 of the bill reads, `Failure to negotiate a case management activity agreement'. This section will apply if:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii)agree . . .</PARA>
<PARA>As far as any common understanding of the English language is concerned, `negotiate' means that one would attend and there would be the potential to disagree. Negotiation is hardly undertaken in any aspect of life where initially the negotiating parties agree. If they agree when they first meet, of course, there is no negotiation; it becomes an agreement. But to negotiate an agreement means to seek to resolve the disagreements and to arrive at a satisfactory position after some discussion and some amendment of the original positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all that this amendment is trying to achieve&mdash;a process by which the negotiation can take place and original propositions can be modified and finally concluded. The position has been put to us that to alter it in such a way as this amendment does would allow matters to go on ad nauseam. That is not the case. This is an attempt to redress the imbalance which is placed in the process by deeming that people have failed to hold up their side if they fail to agree. That proposition is manifestly unfair, it is obvious that it is unfair and it should be modified in the way that is proposed here. We strongly support the amendment and we will support it defiantly if there is any suggestion that it will not succeed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not accept this amendment. I think it is important&mdash;particularly in the light of Senator Bell's suggestion that there might be a division about this; it is a matter of some importance&mdash;that we put on the record a few other aspects of this debate which Senator Margetts elegantly left out. I refer, for example, to her suggestion that if there is not an agreement, down comes the axe and, thwacko, you are gone&mdash;no compact, no allowance. That is not exact at all. I say to Senator Bell that in terms of negotiating, he actually read out that the legislation requires people to attend a negotiation. I notice we do not say they should `attend and enter into', which is what the debate on the same issue was about when I was here last night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the legislation allows for a very large amount of flexibility and understanding. Section 124(2)(a) of the act provides that payment of allowance must continue pending review of the failure to agree to terms. That is an important point that Senator Margetts failed to contribute in arguing for her amendment. To further quote from the guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a client is making a genuine attempt to negotiate but is clearly unhappy with a particular term, reasonable efforts should be made to reach consensus with the client either by modifying the term or, in some cases, replacing it with a term proposed by the client which achieves the same purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>They are fairly clear guidelines which suggest that there is not an arbitrary decision made unilaterally and which contain language which is aimed very much at trying to agree on what is best for the client who is entering into this compact. But at a certain stage we have to say, `We are serious about this and we do not want'&mdash;in Senator Troeth's words&mdash;`non-productive activities continuing for too long'&mdash;mainly because the principal concern of government is that those long time unemployed are assisted into employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance struck in this legislation more than justifies the government not accepting this amendment from Senator Margetts. A lot of this discussion was being run through in this place last night and, as Senator Margetts said on a previous occasion when discussing a previous bill, I do not think it is helpful to put the amendment without putting all the relevant parts of the legislation that already cover many of the points she raised by way of arguing for the amendment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, there you go: the Social Security Act. Our original contention was that a lot of this stuff was recreating bits that were already in the hands of another department and Senator Margetts pointed to the fact that there seems to be a bit of an interdepartmental feud here. So it is very difficult to know who is running the show. When the three of us who are conducting this debate from the coalition, the Democrats and the Greens received advice from departmental officials, we were led to believe that the Employment Services Bill was intended to override the youth training allowance bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment refers to part of the bill which needs to be clarified. For the minister to quote to me a section of the Social Security Act which virtually drives this and to say what ought to happen, without this bill itself explaining it, is symptomatic of our problem, because this bill says&mdash;and it is unequivocal in this fashion; it does not say anything else&mdash;that this clause will apply if the person fails to agree to the terms of the agreement proposed by the case manager. It does not say `fails to arrive at a negotiated position'; it says `fails to agree with what is proposed by the case manager.' That is so one-sided that anything contained in the Social Security Act, as far as I am concerned, can neither modify nor illuminate it sufficiently for it to be described as a fair negotiation. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments are similar to my amendments 5 and 6, which I previously moved. The intent is to apply the same principle to group enterprises and cooperative enterprises as are applied to self-employment. Again, it is a question of what is the best economic test of viability that should be applied where there is community or public interest benefit involved. It seems to me to be self-evident that we should have a more flexible test to expand the breadth of the jobs compact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I do not see any need to keep adding words. They are obviously having little effect. The words have already been put forward with regard to amendments 5 and 6. Amendment 8 is a consequential amendment to No. 7. Amendment 11 is again partly consequential. The amendments seek to ensure that we do not preclude continued participation in a community based cooperative if that participation continues to be a public benefit, notwithstanding that a job seeker has been involved with the activity previously. In other words, we do not want to have a rigorous cutting off of the benefits that the job seeker derives from being involved in a community enterprise. It seems to me that this makes&mdash;and I am sick of using the word&mdash;commonsense. This is how life works. People are involved in things and people are contributors. There really should not be bureaucratic axes coming down to separate them from real life. Just because it looks good on paper does not mean that that is how things work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the parliamentary secretary would be aware of the cooperative which has delivered a number of jobs in the Glenorchy municipality. Glenorchy Resources reclaims discarded materials and employs around about 20 people at the moment. Some of those jobs are very flexible in terms of teaching driving delivery skills and the sort of work one would obtain as a courier&mdash;delivering parcels and messages. If some of these young people were to move away from that employment, but voluntarily contributed to that community enterprise, then the bill as proposed would preclude them from being involved if they wanted to enter into a jobs compact program subsequent to their leaving the other community enterprise. They would be precluded from being involved in any way. These amendments deliver the sort of flexibility which is necessary to live life in a real sense, rather than in a bureaucratic sense. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This very sensible option has a lot of trouble operating under the current laws&mdash;under the new enterprise scheme and so on&mdash;because it is not recognised. It is not recognised because somehow or other it does not exist legally. Therefore, people have to work under all sorts of other laws that do not exist for cooperative ownership. Cooperative ownership is very sensible. It allows shared risk. It allows people to work together and to build up their skills. It exists and is operating in a number of places throughout Australia. A cooperative association in Queensland is doing some amazing things. Areas such as Maleny are quite advanced in this respect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes proposed amendments Nos 7, 8 and 11. We oppose amendment No. 7 because it seeks to draw community based and artistic work into the same ambit as the new group or cooperative enterprise clauses. For the same reasons advanced in opposing amendment No. 5, the government considers that this is inappropriate and confusing, given that the former type of activity is unpaid and aims to help job seekers find possible avenues to paid employment, whereas the latter two activities are aimed at giving job seekers the opportunity to achieve income self-sufficiency. Amendment No. 8 is opposed because it is technically related to No. 7.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We oppose amendment No. 11 because it is unnecessary. As has previously been explained, voluntary work is clearly designated in the legislation as a separate category of activity from group or cooperative enterprises. A person would, therefore, not normally be precluded from undertaking a group or cooperative enterprise activity where they had previously engaged in voluntary work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts's comments about investment issues, cooperatives in general and the management of enterprises contained some valid points, but not in the context of this legislation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am astounded by the parliamentary secretary's last statement. Since it is what this amendment is concerned with, why not debate the role of cooperatives in society right here and now? As Senator Margetts mentioned, cooperatives are being forced, in a pioneering sense, into delivering the goods; they are employing people and creating employment. What is wrong with recognising that in this legislation? The real world is not compartmentalised; the real world is integrated. This legislation will affect what goes on elsewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Margetts was talking, I was reminded of something that should impress Senator Panizza. I cannot remember which particular Wimmera town it was&mdash;either Kaniva or Jeparit, or one of those small flour milling towns somewhere between Stawell and Horsham&mdash;but in one of those towns, over the past couple of years, the community has gathered together and decided to revitalise one of the old flour mills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many decades flour mills were the heart of Victorian industry but became redundant after multinationals or large companies took over the industry. The group of people had little capital and were unable to pay each other in real cash while they were beginning. But they invested their debt in a cooperative sense and were able to establish a very viable industry after a year when they had milled enough wheat, had established a market and were starting to return a profit. It was then that the cooperative members were able to be paid in cash rather than kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This enterprise was successful only because they did not follow the conventional model of borrowing money, being obliged to a bank and paying award wages from an administrative staff to a labouring staff; rather, they entered into it in a cooperative manner and invested their debt with each other. I know that that is what Senator Margetts was talking about and I know that there are many other examples around Australia. Why not talk about this here and now? It is about employment. Our amendment seeks to make such things more possible. </PARA>

It ought to be about empowering people to undertake the activities that they wish to undertake and which have some community benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall a previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, saying, I think on advice from his Treasurer, that we should as a modern society acknowledge that there will never be a situation where all people who desire to be in employment will be able to be in traditional employment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Treasurer (Mr Willis) is on record as saying that one of the major problems with unemployment at present is the labour force participation rate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somebody made a suggestion that there should be a freedom of choice. One of the problems with this government is that it is not giving a freedom of choice for persons to engage in socially constructive alternative work, whether it is paid work in the traditional sense or whether it is unpaid work that is a constructive alternative with social benefits to the whole of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have previously indicated in this place that that is the approach that should be taken in respect of parenting.

It seems to me that paid employment does not appear to be defined anywhere in the legislation. It may include self-employment; it may not.

He suggested that in the future we may not be able to afford that distinction and we may need to redefine in legislation what is recognised as valuable employment. Again, amendment No. 9 allows us to remove the difference that the bill brings to these definitions so that we would find it easier to place a value on that employment which is not paid. I can think of a vast number of contributions to our community which are not paid, which the community values and which nobody in their right mind would deny as real, useful employment. </PARA>

As far as I am concerned, it is a debate in which I would expect a very strong case to be made that the community values highly employment which is not necessarily paid.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have discussed the effect of this particular amendment before&mdash;it seems several times now&mdash;but I wish to emphasise it. The remarks I made in conclusion of our discussions about the previous amendment apply very strongly here, and I hope the government can consider the individual merit of this amendment. The coalition has shown that it is capable of distinguishing between the individual amendments that we have proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, I would like to emphasise that this amendment seeks to ensure that an unemployed person should not be required to take a job placement if that work is unlikely to result in sustainable, long-term employment&mdash;assuming reasonable diligence on the part of the employee. As Senator Margetts pointed out before, the secretary or the case manager is being imbued with all sorts of skills and abilities in this legislation. To make our amendment work, it would require some sort of assessment by the secretary. If the unemployed person disagrees with the secretary's assessment, there will be an appeal right. This is just and fundamental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployed people should not be forced to take up positions which they know are not sustainable. I defy the government to prove otherwise, but there is implicit, as an intrinsic part of this legislation, pressure for case managers to conclude their management. Let us remember that they are not only case managing four or five people. It may be quite easy to meet the hype of this legislation and all the theories behind it if a case manager were only responsible for five or six people. In fact, they could get to the stage where it is more than 100, or perhaps even more than 200 people, that they are attempting to find placements for. So I defy the government to deny that there is some pressure on case managers to actually conclude and receive the cash payment on the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, there is this pressure. It is unemployed people themselves who will be the recipients of that pressure in the long term. They should not be forced to take up positions which they know are not sustainable. If the people or the department knows that they are only there until the jobstart subsidy gives out, what sort of a job future is that? It is no better than the vacuum that some people find themselves in now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this provision will place more emphasis on the quality of placements. I deliberately emphasise that word `quality', and I think it deserves to be looked at. A placement is not just a placement. If we are going to case manage people and go to the trouble of identifying individuals and what is necessary for them and make the effort to separate them and look at their individual requirements, the quality of the placement is the very thing that needs to be emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking about this, I am reminded of a speech given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Parramatta on Friday, 2 December.

<PARA>If the Prime Minister really means that, and if this legislation is going to be the vehicle for doing it, we need to be concerned about the quality of their placements and not just treat them as a number or as part of a block of people. We need to look at their individual placements and give them the capacity to say, `No, that is not for me. No, that is not a real job. No, that will not last for any length of time.'

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14Clause 42, page 26, at end of paragraph (2)(b), add "and the person is prepared to commute.".</PARA>
<PARA>These amendments deal with what is a reasonable commuting time. The current bill proposes a two-tier test. The first tier says that if the trip is less than 90 minutes one way&mdash;that is, three hours per day&mdash;it is reasonable and that the person must commute. The second test goes further and says that even if it is more than three hours total in a day, and if the employment secretary believes that a substantial number of people commute, it is reasonable to demand that they commute. I do not know how many people that is. We have talked this morning about what the word `some' means. In this case, we have the word `substantial'. I suggest that it is about as precise. It leaves it pretty much open-ended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment says that an unemployed person, even one with children, will be required to spend up to three or even four hours per day commuting or face the penalty of a loss of benefits. It is true that the second section is appealable. The first is not; it is a set test involving up to three hours. You must do it; there are no ifs or buts. What adds to the difficulty is that the government is yet to finalise its arrangements for fares assistance. Three hours travelling on public transport does not come cheaply. We really do not know what the cost might be. I suggest that it would be substantial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments deal with the problem in two steps. We seek to reduce the maximum time for reasonable commuting by half from 90 minutes one way, or three hours in total, to 45 minutes one way or an hour and a half, or 90 minutes total, for the day's commuting. This sets a minimum time below which the person cannot refuse a position on account of unreasonable commuting. That is not to say that everybody would refuse it on that basis. It is just a minimum time below which people could not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be clear what we are establishing here. We are saying `below which a person cannot refuse'&mdash;not that they must refuse anything that is above 45 minutes but that they fail the test if they refuse it below 45 minutes. I think that is fair. Forty-five minutes normal commuting would cover the vast majority of the usual commuting routes in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only exceptions would probably be from the outer fringes of Sydney and Melbourne to the other side. I do not think we should be setting our standards by the yardstick of outer suburban Sydney. Whatever they do there, I do not think, can be described as normal. Perhaps everything they do is abnormal&mdash;I do not know. I think a reasonable minimum standard should be one which is reasonable for the vast majority of Australians, with appropriate exceptions built in for a minority. Ninety minutes is not acceptable for a majority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The limited case of the Sydney or Melbourne outer suburbs could be dealt with by the second part, that is, where a substantial number of people are already commuting. That is a qualifier. Nobody could argue that a substantial number of people are commuting from Campbelltown to Sydney or from Dandenong to Melbourne; it is not a substantial number. Clearly, that would be a reasonable requirement for travel. But very few people travel or should be required to commute from Beenleigh to Strathpine in Brisbane or from Elizabeth to Noarlunga in Adelaide each day. That is not a normal and recognised sort of journey, and I do not think that anybody could describe it as something that a majority of people do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first test is a stand-alone test, and I would commend it to the committee. If the department wants a person to travel further than that, then the decision would be reviewable. It is only a test below which a person cannot refuse to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also point out that the proposed section goes much further than the current tests on commuting in the Social Security Act for newstart and, I presume, jobstart. I know, for example, that even in the Open Learning Agency there is a definition of commuting which is more like 45 minutes or 60 minutes. It certainly is not 90 minutes. We have had an argument about consistency several times in this debate, and I know that this is not one of those consistent provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a third test&mdash;and this is where we should pay a little more attention&mdash;that is, where the travelling costs exceed 10 per cent of the wage offered. Remembering that under the jobs compact we are talking about training wages for, say, 20-year-olds of $270 or $300 a week&mdash;even less for younger workers&mdash;three hours daily travel on public transport could quite quickly add up to $30 or $40 a week, which would exceed that 10 per cent. That is a better measure of the significance of the travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under newstart, that would be regarded as unreasonable because it is on a wage of $300 or $400, but under the jobs compact it is not regarded as unreasonable by the government. So we need to look here at the consistency angle very carefully&mdash;not only the time but also the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second limb of the unreasonable travelling test is the `substantial number are already travelling' test. This limb applies only where the client has private means of transport or public transport readily available. That is also unreasonable. If they cannot get from A to B, then obviously the commuting is unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think these tests are pretty logical and I wish to foreshadow that, if my original amendment fails to get up, I will be moving a further amendment to reflect the current newstart provisions as a minimum.

<PARA>These amendments go to the heart of the jobs compact. It is a key component of case management activity agreements. I suggest that it is not possible to define an action as an agreement if one side is dictating the terms and the other side is complying. I would have thought that the Labor Party, of all groups of people, would recognise that that is not an agreement but an imposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The idea of reintroducing long-term unemployed into the work force must be based on coopting, cooperation and encouragement. If this jobs compact is to work, it must involve the long-term unemployed in a positive way. It must engage them. It must reflect the sorts of words that I have already quoted from the Prime Minister. It must do that in the legislation. It must respond to individual needs and it must be based on tailoring agreements accordingly. Proposed section 44 starts with the wrong assumption. It starts with the wrong word. It starts with the wrong sympathy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have learned that we cannot look for poetry, emotion and humanity in legislation; but when we have the opposite, we should recognise it. `Failure to negotiate' was a key phrase in a film that I once saw; I wish Senator Loosley were here to tell me which one it was. The film, which depicted very inhuman management of a southern United States boot camp, illustrated what happens when there is failure to negotiate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have those words at the beginning of a set of criteria in a bill before the chamber is, to me, anathema. It starts from the wrong premise. The clause attempts to bring about an agreement. But it will not do so if we start from the premise that it is somebody's fault if agreement is not reached. The bill sets a negotiating environment in which agreements are to be reached. It says that if people fail to reach an agreement their unemployment benefits will be cut off. It is right and correct to say that, if the process fails, we cannot implement what the process was supposed to implement. That is fair enough. But to start from this premise and to adopt this attitude is illustrative of what the problem is with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in proposed clause 44 is a negotiation process which, if it were not enshrined in legislation, would be declared illegal under the Trade Practices Act. I know that in other sections of legislation a reasonable description of an unfair contract is one which is entered into unwillingly or one in which the process is not fair and properly negotiated. Under clause 44(2)(a)(iii), an unemployed person is deemed to have failed to reach an agreement if that person fails to agree to the terms set out by the case manager. If people do not accept that fait accompli, they are turfed out. The more I read this provision&mdash;and I have read it only a couple of times&mdash;the angrier I get about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved three amendments. The first&mdash;amendment No. 15&mdash;sought to delete clause 44(2)(a)(iii) and replace it with a requirement that a case manager and an unemployed person must reach mutually agreed and reasonable terms for the agreement. I would have thought that it was almost impossible to argue against that; but we had a fairly swift dismissal of that amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 16 and 17&mdash;which we are talking about now&mdash;require the department to attempt to mediate a solution on mutually agreeable terms. It is one last attempt at reaching an agreement. I would have thought that this government, of all governments, would do this. This morning I reminded honourable senators of the words breathed by the Prime Minister on Friday, 2 December&mdash;that the government would individually inquire about these people, take a personal interest in them and put them back in the system. This is not the government that is reflected in this wording. The government has not provided for a last attempt to mediate, to inquire about people individually and to look after them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an opportunity for the department to ensure that case managers are not insisting on unreasonable conditions, and that the department meets its obligations under clauses 39(6) and 39(7) as to what can constitute a case management agreement. If the mediation fails to come up with an agreement, a person is deemed to have breached it and, subject to any appeal, his or her benefits are cut off, we believe that is a reasonable process and one that reflects the intentions expressed by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments give meaning to the word `agreement' in the term `case management agreement' as well as to the nice words that we have in clauses 39(6) and 39(7). They also help avoid the allegation that, with this bill, the government is legislating for approval of unconscionable conduct and introducing unfair terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has a chance with this small adjustment to rescue the proposed legislation from the flavour with which it is soaked&mdash;the flavour of one-sided deals. I appeal to the government to recognise that that is what we are trying to do. We are only trying to fix the legislation. We are not trying to change its direction or make it into something it is not. In fact, we are trying to deliver what the Prime Minister said he is delivering. </PARA>

There is a power situation. When people have power over others&mdash;in the end they have the ability to say whether people's incomes will continue&mdash;it can lead to the sort of very inappropriate relationships to which this chamber, and certainly this government, would not want to be party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is not accepting these amendments. The point I particularly want to make to Senator Bell and Senator Woodley is that it is important to know that the agreements allow the case manager considerable flexibility in the negotiation process. In particular, the agreements do not have to be finalised in one sitting. If a job seeker is not happy with a particular terms that his or her case manager has included, there is provision for a cooling-off period which will allow the client to take the agreement away and consider it for up to five days before seeing the case manager again.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the points that Senator Bell raised are very important. But the cooling off period, the opportunity to not have to finish the negotiation in one day, the opportunity to go away and think about it, the opportunity to get back to talk it through&mdash;all of those seem to me to be built-in provisions to ensure just the sort of thing about which Senator Bell is concerned. Those are more than sufficient reasons for us not to accept this amendment, well intentioned as it is. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18Clause 58, page 39, at end of subclause (2), add "and must not include bonus payments of more than 25% of the total fee if the person secures employment".</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to modify the conditions under which private sector case managers will get paid for the provision of services. ESRA will ultimately determine the conditions for payment, and that is probably appropriate. However, the bill provides no guidance to ESRA on how parliament believes fees for services should generally be determined. We had given to us just now some guidelines and I had, in a previous briefing, read to me some departmental guidelines to which parliament is not privy. The parliament is not to know how such guidelines are determined, how they are applied and whether they are complied with. It is all very well for the minister to read us guidelines, but we do not know the answer to those questions&mdash;whether they are actually applied, by whom, and how they are complied with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have in this situation an omission&mdash;unless the minister can point out to me where other acts of parliament apply; she has done so already in a couple of instances&mdash;of what the capacity is of ESRA to determine what case managers will get paid for. In other words, the private sector case managers are to be paid for a provision of services, but we do not really know how that is to be determined. I remind the chamber that this is the first time in Australia's history that a major social welfare delivery function such as employment services has been privatised. I think it is reasonable and appropriate that the parliament provides some guidance on the financial arrangements that impinge on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment seeks to do one thing: set a limit on the maximum amount that can be paid as a bonus if a person is placed. Why should there be a maximum? Why should a big bonus not be paid for performance&mdash;in other words, placement? It is because case management must be about making the long-term unemployed job ready. It must be about identifying their individual needs, responding to those needs individually and building up an individual skill base. But if payment is loaded too much towards placement, case managers will not be all that interested in doing very much about all the things I just described. Placement will dominate, as I think it will anyway because of the pressures of numbers and of continuing to act as case managers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will find inappropriate placements, probably made only because of jobstart subsidies. I am suggesting here and now that they will become the norm, that they will dominate. When the jobstart subsidy runs out the unready and uncertain unemployed people will be back on the dole queue, but of course they will not be long-term unemployed people any more. They will have another set of queuing qualifications to complete&mdash;another hiccup to whatever their plans might be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not disagree with the concept of some sort of recognition of the success of placing a person and some sort of payment or compensation for that success. But we believe that the vast bulk of payments should be for the provision of the service&mdash;the management of a person's case&mdash;and that the counselling, the skill acquisition and the management should be what is paid for. If that service is good and well remunerated, the personal needs addressed and the job readiness of the unemployed person enhanced, and if there are jobs out there that job ready person will, by pure logic, eventually take up a position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two points can be made in relation to that. A person could be as job ready as is possible but, if the employment prospects do not exist, that person will not be matched with a vacancy. The other point is that, if the training and the job readiness is in an area which is not available in the immediate geographical vicinity, it will be harder for that person to gain employment. So the appropriateness of the counselling, the job skilling, and the timeliness are important factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment seeks to set a maximum for bonus payments of 25 per cent of the total fee. That provides an incentive to place the unemployed but it does so without loading it so much as to detract from the real purpose, which we agree with. The real purpose is actually to manage the case, not to get to the end point so quickly just to attract a bonus. We believe that 25 per cent would do that without loading it so much as to detract from the importance of the provision of the case management services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here follows to some extent the proposition that I put as amendment No. 12 to clause 42, which sought to encourage placements in sustainable long-term employment positions. It has the same logic and it is done with the same intent. That amendment having failed, it does not make this one irrelevant. We are trying to tie the financial incentives to the private sector case managers to fund a process to achieve that aim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The frustration I feel, having moved so many amendments which have been rejected this morning, is a frustration which derives from having participated in a very long process of negotiation and of genuine interest in this legislation by the Democrats. We had a genuine willingness to accept the thrust of the legislation, not to challenge it in its thrust and direction, but to attempt to modify it. One of the disappointments which I bring to the chamber this morning is that I detect a degree of departmental petulance. It has taken a great deal of forbearance on my part not to get angry about it, because for many months a considerable part of our party's scant resources has been devoted to understanding this confusing bill, to supporting it in its thrust, without getting in the way. But to be confronted with a backflip on agreements reached and directions endorsed as a result of what I think can only be described by the words I used before&mdash;departmental petulance&mdash;should be mentioned in this place. I make no apology for bringing it up now. The frustrations that have been experienced by both Senator Margetts and me this morning have resulted from a change of mind which has still to be justified on the part of the government. </PARA>

We strongly support Senator Bell's amendment No. 18 because it at least tries to give some guidelines as to what the limits should be on how much we encourage those case managers to do just that.

People feel obliged to answer questions which are invasive. When asked about her accommodation, a young person told the case manager it was none of her business. She was told, `It is my business, and I want you to find more appropriate accommodation.' Even if job seekers are told they do not have to answer questions, they do not feel safe to refuse a reply.

I will deal with amendments 1, 3, 5 and 7 first and then with amendments 2, 4, 6 and 8.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for these amendments is that we would like to keep the two pay cheques after a period of notice has been given for cut-off for an allowance. The government accepted that this be put into the Social Security Act earlier this year. It has now tried to remove it because of minor administration problems. What this re-writing proposes to do is to tidy up the legislation so that there are not any administrative problems, to keep the present preferred situation in for unemployed people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What my amendments 1, 3, 5 and 7 do is to make the notice period very short, that is, three days, and the person is paid the next two payments before getting cut-off. I am sure everybody knows the arguments for this, but whilst I accept that the coalition at this stage is unable to accept this, I would be interested to find out whether it or the government has an alternative suggestion for the `three days' from my amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has used the poor excuse that its administrative period takes 35 days after the warning period and that this is an inadequate and variable procedure. It is within the bureaucracy. It is nowhere outlined in the act, and it is definitely not transparent. Most importantly, this administrative waiting period applies only for activity test breaches, such as adjusting allowances for income from work, resigning from a job voluntarily, being retrenched et cetera. This internal administrative waiting period does not exist for administrative breaches&mdash;such as requirements to attend interviews, ring, fill out forms and return mail&mdash;which account for 6,000 breaches per month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens believe that it is very important to keep in this bill the sections from the Social Security Act which would govern case management services in this country for all unemployed people. The Greens believe that the government has been backhanded by tending to wipe these sections out of the new bill as if they did not exist and had not served a significant function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the opposition and the Democrats for their stated intention of support for amendments 2, 4, 6 and 8. As I said, if there is an alternative to the three day cut-off, I would be pleased to hear any suggestions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on these amendments because they bring back into play an amendment I moved earlier this year to some other legislation. The Democrats believe that these amendments are essential to preserving the arrangements put in place by the amendment which I moved to a social security bill in June this year. That amendment said that people must be notified if they are to lose their income support as a result of having a breach determined against them, and they must receive two more payments before any deferment period could take effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has simply tried to dismantle these provisions by moving amendments to this consequential bill in the House of Representatives. I was pleased to see that the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee gave the government a serve for introducing these amendments as amendments to a consequential bill in another portfolio area. I will not spend time on that issue other than to say that, when people's livelihoods are going to be affected by legislation, it is totally unacceptable to introduce that legislation in a backdoor manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, the government introduced much tougher penalties for people who breach the activity test on their jobsearch or newstart allowance. These tougher penalties were supposedly meant as a quid pro quo for all the positive measures&mdash;and we recognise those&mdash;that the government was going to introduce for the long-term unemployed. Of course, in pushing for tougher penalties, the government ignored the section on page 128 of the white paper which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Program interventions will be more effective where participants are willing and enthusiastic rather than coerced by the threat of penalties related to their income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA>It also chose to ignore the statistics which showed overwhelmingly that the old regime of penalties was already very harsh and was working. Under that old system of penalties, of the 146,000 unemployed people who breached their obligations for a first time, only 13,000 committed another breach within three years. In other words, less than 10 per cent of those who were required to serve a two-week deferment period committed another breach. Similarly, of those who breached twice, only about 10 per cent of that 10 per cent breached a third time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the government also chose to ignore the fact that most of the beneficial aspects of the white paper are not due to be up and running until the middle of next year. Despite the timetable for beneficial measures, the statistical evidence and the urgings of the white paper, the government proposed harsher penalties, and the opposition, regrettably, backed them. To its credit, however, the opposition was prepared to support the Democrats in at least establishing a system whereby people who were going to lose their income support payments would get some prior notice from the department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this system of prior warning that the government is now seeking to do away with. I simply say to the government that all the arguments I presented when first introducing this system still hold and, as such, the Democrats will be supporting the amendments. The government may claim that people are already receiving notice, but that does not line up with the word we are getting back from people in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my remarks by quoting an unemployed man who wrote to the Senate inquiry which was held on this issue. He said that cutting a person off the dole would bring about nothing short of a personal crisis. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Precipitating crisis in the members of its community would hardly seem to be a worthy government objective.</PARA>
<PARA>This is precisely what the extended penalty periods will be doing and the amendments contained in this bill will only exacerbate that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Margetts pointed out, the coalition will be supporting Green amendments 2, 4, 6 and 8. We will not be supporting amendments Nos 1, 3, 5 and 7. I would like to speak to the amendments we will be supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has stated that it agrees with the general thrust of the approach the government is taking in relation to reciprocal obligation requirements to the extent that it can be done equitably. The administration of the deferment period should give a clear signal to a person who has undertaken reciprocal obligations under the activity test agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given our concern with equity, the coalition has consistently insisted that any amendments to the procedures determined by the Senate in June should be fair to the person whose benefits will be deferred. For this reason, Dr Kemp, the shadow minister for employment, training and family services, requested the government to refer its proposed amendments to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training so that the coalition and the public could have the benefit of a detailed consideration of the implications of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the event, these amendments were not made available to the committee in sufficient time to allow it to reach a conclusion as to their fairness or otherwise. Nor have repeated inquiries by the opposition to the government on this matter produced satisfactory justification for the removal of the provision for the two payment periods following notification of the activity test breach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last week, while negotiation on this bill has been taking place, the government has indicated on almost a daily basis that it will put forward guidelines which will address our concerns on this matter. In the event, none of these guidelines have been produced&mdash;even up to as late as this morning. We simply are not prepared to go ahead and back the government on the basis that the guidelines will be produced some time in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has repeatedly failed to justify why people who would be in straitened financial circumstances would immediately lose their benefit when they are making an appeal which could be successful. The bipartisan House of Representatives committee was not prepared to commit itself to outright support for the government's proposal. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue of deferment of allowances is a complex policy matter that the committee has not had sufficient time to investigate.</PARA>
<PARA>Its recommendation was that it is essential that sufficient notice be given before income support payments are deferred due to a breach of obligations. That is on page 33 of its report. In relation to administrative breaches, the period of 60 days quoted in the report and referred to by the department in briefings, in our view, is likely to be an extreme case and not typical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department made the point that the wording of the June amendment was administratively difficult because the department had no way of knowing when a notice of deferment had been received, and that the two instalments of jobsearch allowance should be based on the sending out of the notification rather than its receipt. ACOSS was extremely concerned by the most recent proposed amendments and was also concerned that tighter reciprocal obligations constituted a punitive approach that is unhelpful and runs entirely counter to the case management approach. It agreed that the amendment to allow deferral periods to operate from the time the notice is sent is necessary, but believes that this is only acceptable if there is a period of notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Welfare Rights Centre explained that two extra payments are most important to allow recipients time, firstly, to lodge an appeal against the decision before any financial loss is incurred and, secondly, to arrange their financial affairs before the penalty period takes effect. Accordingly, we are not prepared to accept the deletion of the provision for two additional payments following notification of an activity test breach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the chamber for coming back into this debate after being out of it for an hour and a half. As I understand it, we are having a general discussion about amendments 1, 3, 5 and 7 which are being taken together, and amendments 2, 4, 6 and 8.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government opposes amendments 1, 3, 5 and 7. Prescribing a three-day limit on the giving of a written notice to the person who has incurred a deferment of allowance is an impossible imposition which displays no understanding of the process involved after the CES has made the decision to cancel a person's allowance. The CES decision is transferred electronically to the Department of Social Security, which in turn must process it and then issue the notice through its mail house facility. As this process is largely automated and depends on factors such as the volume of transactions to be processed at any one time, it would be impossible for the CES or the DSS to meet this limit in all cases. That is why we oppose those amendments. As I understand it, the opposition is also opposing those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government opposes amendments 2, 4, 6 and 8 which, I understand, the opposition is supporting and to which Senator Troeth has just spoken. They simply perpetuate the two payments system and are no more workable or acceptable to the government than the amendments introduced into the legislation by the Australian Democrats in July. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two payment provisions have proved administratively unworkable. For example, the time lapse between the notice of a requirement and the imposition of the appropriate deferment penalty has had to be substantially lengthened because of the need to ensure that the deferment period only commences after the notice specifying the commencement date is actually received by the person. This requirement means that the decision maker must make a decision on an event about which he or she cannot be certain at the time the decision is made. To overcome this uncertainty, additional time has been built into the process to ensure that the legislation is complied with in all cases. This additional time lapse is in the order of two to three weeks, which sends the wrong signals to allowance recipients about the importance of their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure the chamber that it is not the government's aim to deal harshly with the unemployed; however, it is our responsibility on behalf of the whole community to ensure that they respond positively to the many and varied measures of assistance offered to them. This is the essence of reciprocal obligations, and the success of the CES in helping job seekers is largely dependent on their timely and cooperative responses to the requirements made of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the government's amendments will ensure that a person is given a clear requirement to attend at or contact the CES, as well as an appropriate deadline in having to respond in five to 21 days. Failure to respond to that requirement will generate a second letter which clearly warns people that they risk the loss of allowance if they fail to respond within a further 14 days. The CES can be approached at any time during this process to change an appointment or to listen to a person's reasons or complaints. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of an apparent activity test breach the client is invited to explain the circumstances of his or her non-compliance before any decision is taken to apply a breach and impose a deferment period. When a person is found to have breached a requirement and requests a review of that decision there is discretion for the authorised review officer to continue payment of allowance to the person pending a review of the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government firmly believes that these procedures are fair and equitable and provide sufficient notice to the person of the consequences of failing to respond to a specific requirement made of the person. To retain a provision which effectively rewards that failure with a two further payments of allowance breaks the nexus between breach and penalty and sends the wrong signals to job seekers about the importance of their reciprocal obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to comment on the guidelines which Senator Troeth mentioned. I have been advised that these guidelines were discussed with Dr Kemp's office on Wednesday following discussions on Monday and Tuesday with Dr Kemp's adviser, a Ms Kate Harvey. Dr Kemp's office did not agree or disagree with the guidelines or accept them but I will just put them on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the guidelines which were put to Dr Kemp's office: the powers conferred by sections 124(1) and 125(1) enable the authorised review officer or area manager to decide, with or without a specific request from the affected person, that payment of allowance should continue to the person pending the review of that decision. In deciding whether to exercise this discretion each case should be considered on its merits having regard to all the circumstances presented by the person and other relevant factors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following considerations should be taken into account: the potential for financial hardship while the review is being undertaken&mdash;that is, whether the person will have sufficient other income or means of support, for example, family or friends; and whether there are alternative means of income support for the person's dependants, if any, bearing in mind that, where people are facing a longer deferment period, they may need the review period to organise their finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major point in the guidelines is the person's compliance history; a person with no previous record of breaches should expect more leniency than someone who has repeatedly breached before. The final point of the guidelines is whether a person has any apparent physical, mental, or intellectual disability or condition which may be adversely affected if payment is not continued. We believe that those guidelines cover the concerns raised by the committee and that amendments Nos 2, 4, 6 and 8 to be moved by the Western Australian Greens should be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction for his intervention. I see he is being as helpful as usual. This afternoon Senator Ian Campbell, the shadow minister for sport, will be having an interview with senior members of the Australian Soccer Federation relating to the inquiry by Mr Justice Stewart into certain aspects of transfer payments and other matters of concern to Australian soccer which were first raised in general by the ABC on its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of former Mr Justice Stewart, which was due originally to be presented to the federation in September, was delayed until 1 December. In the interim, the Senate has on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> a notice of motion that this question should be referred to a Senate committee. This motion has not been brought forward because quite properly its mover, Senator Campbell, wanted to ensure that the Soccer Federation had every opportunity of dealing with this matter in its own way, which was to have its own report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Soccer Federation for, firstly, having an inquiry and for, secondly, having someone of the eminence of former Mr Justice Stewart conducting it. However, I pointed out at the time&mdash;and pressed the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) on this matter&mdash;that such an inquiry would of necessity not provide the protection against legal action that would be needed if its findings were to be publicly released. There would be no doubt that potentially defamatory material would have to be involved in such an inquiry, because there were very serious allegations made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had heard allegations, for example, from many people within the soccer community. I used to play in Sydney and was a referee there. Many good friends&mdash;most of them, I would be happy to admit, much better soccer players than I was&mdash;have been expressing their concerns to me. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hate to admit it, but of all places I was left full-back, which did not seem to fit in with my political orientation. But the right full-back in one team I played with was Dr Klugman, one of Senator Schacht's former colleagues. That was at university.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was, as I pointed out, that the lack of legal protection for witnesses and for the report itself was simply unacceptable. That is why I thought there should have been a an inquiry, perhaps a parliamentary inquiry, with particular powers to enable evidence and conclusions to be protected against the threat of defamation action. The Soccer Federation took the view that it could insure against this eventuality and that that would provide sufficient protection. I disagreed and, in fact, we have had lengthy talks about it. I took the view, which now appears correct, that the risks were far too great. I understand that is one of the reasons why this report, which was presented to the Soccer Federation on the first of this month, has not yet been released. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no likelihood of its being released in the near future, as far as I can understand. That is the reason why the shadow minister for sport has gone to Sydney to discuss with the top people in the Soccer Federation what the problem really is. Quite frankly, unless there is a very sound reason for the Senate not proceeding with this inquiry in these circumstances, I would be strongly in favour of the Senate proceeding with its own inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this is, of course, self-evident: about $2 million a year of taxpayers' money goes towards support and promotion of soccer in Australia. I think that is great and I am all in favour of it, and I do not want to see that put at risk by anything that may emerge from this inquiry. It concerns me that there will be suggestions of a cover-up if the details and the conclusions of this inquiry are not publicly revealed, and that there will be suspicions as to why various matters that should be in the public arena are not in the public arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the great advantages that would emerge, if the Senate inquiry did proceed&mdash;I think notice of that matter has been deferred until tomorrow&mdash;is that it would provide the Australian Soccer Federation with an opportunity to have all this material put on the record as part of the evidence of a Senate inquiry and therefore given protection. I would hope that the Australian Soccer Federation would ask us to proceed with that. It seems to me that it would be in the federation's best interests and it would demonstrate that it had nothing to hide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite frankly, knowing some of the people in the Australian Soccer Federation, I would think that the great bulk of them would be of that view, that it would be in their best interests to be shown to have nothing to hide. At the moment, there is no national sponsor for the National Soccer League. I would think the prospects of getting that kind of financial support would be diminished until the sport was shown to be clean, as I hope it is and I feel sure it will be in the future. However, until the Soccer Federation takes that view, questions must hang over the sport. I would hope that when the Senate discusses this matter&mdash;hopefully tomorrow&mdash;we will take the view that having such an inquiry will be in the interests of the Soccer Federation and of soccer. But I do not want to canvass that debate tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many additional problems that the Soccer Federation has to recognise it must resolve. There are matters that go beyond the role of the Soccer Federation. It has resolved some particular problems affecting it, but there are matters relating to other proceedings and other prosecutions, in some instances. There are reports from bodies such as the National Crime Authority and there are internal police reports. I would think that those could properly be presented to a Senate inquiry; although, the inquiry may have to be extended beyond the very specific and limited role of Senator Campbell's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Soccer Federation for having taken some steps in what appear to be matters of concern relating to the potential for a conflict of interest. For example, the annual report of the Soccer Federation for 1993 reveals that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A director of the Federation, Mr J. Constantine, is the principal of Constantine &amp; Co., Solicitors. This firm rendered legal advice to the economic entity&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the Australian Soccer Federation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All dealings were in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercial terms and conditions. Fees paid to Constantine &amp; Co. during the year totalled $72,725.</PARA>
<PARA>I see no particular problems with that, but I do not think it is a procedure that all people would be happy with. Obviously, some people would not be happy with it. I think it probably creates an unfortunate impression that when you go into the Soccer Federation's building it is basically the same office&mdash;turn left and it is Constantine and Co., turn right and it is the Soccer Federation. In any event, I understand that that matter has been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter has been resolved, that is a director of the federation, Mr Tony Labbozzetta, who resigned during the year, has an interest as a partner in the business Marconi Travel. This business renders service in connection with travel arrangements for the federation in respect of interstate and international travel. All dealings with the business are in the ordinary course of business and on normal commercials terms and conditions. Moneys paid to Marconi Travel during the year in respect of travel arrangements amounted to $129,246. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point once again that when there are those internal relationships there will inevitably be questions, particularly when Mr Labbozzetta, who has been heavily involved  with the Marconi club, has been subjected to a fair amount of inquiry under the licensing court actions relating to alleged improper behaviour in the running of that club. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to repeat the allegations made. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> had an article yesterday with the headline `Marconi president faces 10-year ban'. These are matters on the public record. It was alleged that Mr Labbozzetta was not a truthful witness. My concerns are that this question of travel is a very important one when you are involved in a national sporting organisation. People have to be seen to be purer than pure when they are in this relationship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What concerns me in particular is that some members of the Labbozzetta family, particularly Francesco who was involved with the Marconi Travel company, have been the subject of an internal police confidential inquiry. Once again, I do not want to canvass the contents of that inquiry. There may be an appropriate time when it can be presented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were links with another travel company in South Australia, a company called Sea Air Travel in which Francesco Nicola Labbozzetta was shown as one of the owners for three years. Unfortunately, this company has been involved with another family, the members of which were involved in prosecutions relating to something like $3 million of tax avoided and additional tax relating to understatements of taxation&mdash;this was the result of a National Crime Authority report. There were serious allegations made about how that money was earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are all matters that should and could properly be the subject of an inquiry, if that was the course to take. If one rang the South Australia Soccer Federation and said one wanted to go to the World Cup in the United States earlier this year, the travel company recommended by the South Australia Soccer Federation was Sea Air Travel because that company was organising packages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, it seems to me this raises serious problems, particularly as the family involved in Sea Air Travel, it has been claimed, has been involved in drug dealing. It is recorded as such in the National Crime Authority annual report for 1990-91. In other words, there is a series of problems that need to be looked at and, in the overall issue, these are not directly related to the running of the Australian Soccer Federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soccer has to clear itself of all of these bad associations and it has to start at the top. The best way for the Soccer Federation to do so is to encourage and to support the inquiry by the Senate. All the matters brought up by Justice Stewart should be put on the record so that the public can see that the Soccer Federation has done the right thing in conducting the Stewart inquiry and that there is nothing to hide as a result of that inquiry's ultimate report. I believe that the Soccer Federation made the right decision in conducting the inquiry.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Western Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.01 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take this opportunity to echo concerns which have been raised in a number of forums lately about the arrest rate for Aboriginal people in the town of Wiluna in Western Australia. In particular, the Aboriginal Legal Service in Western Australia has pointed to the enormous increase in arrest rates since there was a change in police personnel earlier this year. There have also been comments from a local justice of the peace, who is quoted in the media as saying that Aboriginal people need to be locked up for their own protection. It is a deeply disturbing situation for such views to be held by a public officer who is able to enforce his views by the power to imprison people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> of 7 November about the arrest rate for Aboriginal women in the town:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From January until August this year, 720 female arrests were made in a community of about 80 women.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that, in an eight-month period, every Aboriginal woman in the town could have been arrested an average of nine times. The Aboriginal Legal Service points out that many of these arrests are based on a charge of communicating with prisoners who are on the lawns of the lockup, even though there is an open-gate policy allowing people to visit their relatives. These arrests attracted prison sentences of three weeks, in spite of the commitment of all jurisdictions in Australia to imprisonment being an option of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comment by the ALS that these charges are being used as a discretionary tool by the police as a means of stopping people talking to prisoners clearly is one that should be taken very seriously. Furthermore, disruption to the lives of families, which must occur time and time again, can only contribute to the pressures and stresses on all concerned. I am sure that honourable senators feel as I do; the prospect of a woman going to see her partner, who happens to be in the lock-up, and then not returning must have serious consequences for her children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALS has conducted extensive research on the situation in Wiluna and has produced a report which presents some very disturbing statistics. I will provide some of the statistics. From 1991-92 to 1994, the total population of Wiluna fell from 400 to 250. Of the people charged in 1991-92, 97 per cent were Aboriginal. During the study period in 1994, 99 per cent of the people charged were Aboriginal. The total number of charges laid in 1991-92 was 522. In the period from 1 January until the end of August this year, 1,071 charges were laid; this in spite of the drop in population. Of these charges, in 1991-92 there were 208 street offences, while there were 846 street offences in the 1994 period. In 1991-92, 184 serious charges were laid, and that figure dropped by half in 1994 to 92. The study draws some interesting conclusions at this point and it refers to age and gender characteristics of the charge patterns. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Current policing involves the criminalisation of a far broader cross-section of the community than is the norm.</PARA>
<PARA>In particular, charge rates for females in the Aboriginal community of Wiluna are more than twice the female charge rate in the general Western Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make particular mention of the treatment of intoxicated persons in recent Wiluna policing practices. Whereas the numbers of people apprehended as intoxicated have remained largely static, the proportion detained for being intoxicated has risen enormously because police stopped transferring people to their home or to other places. Overall, the report states that the case load of charges in Wiluna shows that a far greater proportion of minor charges and far fewer serious charges are laid than is the case when the whole state is considered,</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to question the need for such a high arrest and detention rate when it is considered that 88 per cent of charge outcomes result in fines. If imprisonment is an unlikely outcome upon conviction, detention should not be the initial response to the offence. There is clearly no danger to the community in 88 per cent of cases presented; therefore there should be no thought of placing people in the lockup. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may consider it encouraging to see that fines are being imposed instead of imprisonment terms. However, the pattern in 1994 has been that the real monetary level of the fines imposed has doubled since 1991-92. As a result of this, a great number of people were imprisoned for those fines. To give some idea of the level of fines imposed, for the entire population of some 250 people the fines amounted to an average of $789 per person&mdash;man, woman and child&mdash;for the period of the study. There is a sense in which this whole issue begs the question whether there are, in fact, too many police in the town. After all, if police are prepared to do the paperwork necessary to maintain such an arrest rate, they obviously have considerable time on their hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The justice of the peace, to whom I referred, has been quoted as saying that he thinks the local police strength of seven full-time officers is `about right' for a town the size of Wiluna. In my view, that is an outrageous statement. Extrapolated state wide, that would mean that the WA police force should comprise 43,000&mdash;or over 10 times the current police force. While I am sure that we would find elements in the WA community, maybe even in the police force, who would agree, this is palpable nonsense&mdash;and I know that there are many members of the police force who would not agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary that, four years after the conclusions of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody became known, we are still failing in the crucial area of reducing custody rates for Aboriginal people, and reducing them in areas where there is clearly no threat to the community. When we find that 88 per cent of these arrests result in fines as penalties, and we know they are not serious offences, it is indefensible that we are still continuing with practices that result in this kind of custody rate for our Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue goes to the very heart of the relations between Aboriginal people and the police and also the community at large. There are clearly too many discretionary means by which police&mdash;and I do not think this is restricted to Western Australia&mdash;can control the lives of Aboriginal people. Arrests for minor offences or infractions have a disproportionate effect when they are repeated time and time again. Such incidents breed the very resentment which has poisoned relations between Aboriginal people and those in positions of authority since colonial times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet there are towns in which tensions between Aboriginal people and police have been reduced and arrest rates have been reduced. There are clear indications that cooperation between the two groups can and does work. For instance, in Broome there is a police-community relations committee which has been instrumental in reducing tensions. The work of the Aboriginal visitors scheme should be commended for the way in which their assistance to police has built up a very encouraging rapport and a capacity to work together on community issues. `Community policing', that code word which seems to have a multitude of meanings, can be made to work when there is a commitment to it. If issues can be addressed as they arise, if tensions can be dealt with by discussion at a local level, then progress can be made. And we desperately need progress in this area because, without wanting to be alarmist, there are lives at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue also raises again the matter of the meal allowances which are paid to police officers in Western Australia to provide meals to people in lockups. It comes as no surprise that the response from the highest levels of the police force has again been to say that the matter will be reviewed. But the matter has been reviewed time and time again and always the response has been to keep the system going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add: I first became aware of this problem in 1985. In endeavouring to gain statistics on the rate of juvenile detentions in police lockups, which were not collected, I came upon the very interesting information in the department of community services budget that, for that financial year, $40,000 had been transferred from the department of community services to the police department for the meal allowances for juveniles alone. We know that the rate for adults was even greater so we know it is a longstanding and entrenched problem within the criminal justice system which is allowing a very discriminatory practice to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I consider that the present meal allowance scheme remains open to abuse in a number of ways: police being overzealous in making arrests; police proceeding by arrest where a summons would be more appropriate; prisoners being held in custody longer than is necessary, for example, by delaying bail until after a meal period has expired; supply of poor or inadequate qualities of food to prisoners; and, claims for meals that have not been provided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA police force was recently forced to sack a much respected police officer who had been found guilty in court of rorting the meal allowance system. It is time the opportunity for that sort of corruption was ended. Private contractors have indicated that they would be happy to tender for contracts and that they feel sure that it could be done at competitive prices. If ever there was a government function in Western Australia which should be privatised, maybe this is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, there is a policing crisis in Wiluna. The patterns of policing have changed markedly between 1991-92 and 1994. There has been a change of police staff in the town and it is impossible to escape the conclusion that the changes reflect a different emphasis by the officer in charge. The scope of the changes cannot be explained in any other way. Any privatisation or move to a catering contract will not address the deep systemic problem that is there in our police force unless there is a significant shift in attitudes within the police force that support the measure that is supposed to be prevailing in every jurisdiction in this country, which is that prison is the measure of last resort. It should only be utilised where an individual prisoner is a threat to the community or to himself or herself. It is indefensible to use it in the cases in which it is being used at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every government in Australia claims to be committed to implementing the recommendations of the royal commission. Sadly, there is an enormous gulf between the rhetoric and the reality. This is something we have to get right in this country and we have to do so quickly. There are lives at stake in this matter. We cannot proceed to any reconciliation process if we continue to regard our indigenous people in this way and use the police forces in this country as a way of addressing systemic discriminatory practices. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, that is right across Australia. Let us contrast that with what New South Wales is spending. Would the parliamentary secretary like to give us the figure for what New South Wales is spending? It is above that; it is more than $80 million over one year. We quote figures over one year; we do not follow the dishonest practice of quoting things over several years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to that the number of farmers who are being affected: 64,000 farmers in New South Wales. How many of them are getting this aid? Would the parliamentary secretary like to give us the figure? It is actually 1,800&mdash;grossly inadequate. Ninety-four per cent of all farmers in drought affected areas get nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the parliamentary secretary want to tell us about small business? He could give us the figure on how much the government is spending on assisting small business. According to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, one-third of rural businesses are going to collapse after Christmas. The parliamentary secretary is amazingly quiet. Would he like to tell us how much the government is putting into small businesses? Nothing. It is absolutely zero, and the parliamentary secretary knows it. He would be well advised to sit over there and say very little, as he is doing now, and not point out to the people of Australia how inadequate the government's policies are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell the parliamentary secretary this: the government is going to pay at the next election. Even if he has not realised it, most of the marginal seats happen to be in rural and regional Australia: seats like Richmond, Page, Paterson, Macarthur and Gilmore, just to name a few in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This policy that the government has had so far has been roundly condemned by the industry because its guidelines are far too tight. It leaves out areas in northern New South Wales totally: areas around Grafton and Kyogle, areas in the Upper Hunter, and areas around Mudgee. They have severe drought, but because they do not quite get to the figure of 24 out of 36 months they miss out totally. Yet the ecology of the coastal areas like the north coast is far more sensitive than that of inland New South Wales, so 24 months there without rain is far more devastating than it is inland, where the ecology is more acclimatised to a drier climate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government's rule of thumb, across-the-board guidelines do not take any of this into account, and farm families are suffering desperately. They are relying on charity in the absence of any effective social welfare policy for people who have no income. The government will do this for the cities, but will not do it for the bush. Those people have to rely on charity to put money on the table, and that is a disgrace in Australia in the 1990s. It sounds more like the 1890s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages Small Business Index</EMPHASIS>, as I mentioned before, said that it goes beyond the farm families, it goes to the business families. Take towns like Moree, for example. Moree relies on the cotton crop&mdash;a crop that has totally collapsed because of lack of water. What has also collapsed is the Moree economy: $5 million has been sucked out of it because of this. Usually, 300 people go into Moree at this time each year to harvest cotton. This year, no-one came. Why should they? There is nothing to harvest. So the money that those people generate is not going into the small businesses. What is the government doing to help those people? Absolutely nothing&mdash;and that story is repeated right across rural Australia, particularly rural New South Wales and Queensland. The Keating government has not delivered one cent to small businesses in drought relief. Let us hope that in the new package that is coming out it does something about that aspect, as the New South Wales coalition government has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales drought coordinator, Geoff File, has confirmed the point that I made earlier: that the farmhand money and other charity funds are going to dry up before Christmas. Some 5,300 families have received money from farmhand. What are they going to do after Christmas? They are not going to have any money at all; and the government is not going to provide them any unless, in its package today, it rather belatedly does something about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Smith Family plans to step into the breach with an appeal called `Christmas to the Bush', and hopes to raise another $4 million. As we know, though, there is not a bottomless pit of charitable money. If the Smith Family is raising $4 million for the bush because the government is not putting funds in, that is obviously going to have a ricochet effect through urban Australia as well. The charity funds that are raised there are going to be less because the charities are forced to respond to this government's lack of response to a crisis in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has promised to put in a revised package to cabinet today. Let me suggest what it should include. It should include wider exceptional circumstances provisions for those areas that are left out of this 24 out of 36 months criteria. A priority must be put on spending on drought assistance over other programs. There should be a vastly improved income equalisation deposit scheme with significant tax advantages to help farmers drought proof their properties. If this is done, it will reverse the disastrous 1992 drought policy which encouraged people to put things away for tough days. That was the policy in 1992 actually during the drought. It is a bit hard to start putting things aside for a drought when people are in the middle of it. Of course, the policy has been totally inappropriate for current circumstances in the first part of the 1990s and the government should urgently revise and reverse that. Tax breaks also need to be put on farm infrastructure for fodder, storage and dams to assist in bad times. People in the bush are waiting in hope today for these new announcements from the federal government. We hope this time something effective might be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime in New South Wales, the Fahey coalition government is doing something effective. It has already committed $116 million&mdash;that is now the cumulative total&mdash;on this drought aid compared to the government's figure of $82 million, if we annualise it. Let us compare apples with apples here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the ALP government not put more money into drought aid? The New South Wales Deputy Premier, Ian Armstrong, says that New South Wales is really appealing for a widening of the exceptional circumstances criteria with this government. However, he says that it is getting nowhere with the federal ALP government. I can share his frustration with the inaction of this minister. We cannot get any sensible answers out of him in the Senate in question time. That is why we have got to keep asking ourselves questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, I outline what the New South Wales government is doing. It has committed to provide financial assistance to farmers to plant next seasons cereal crops. New South Wales will participate in the western division of New South Wales drought recovery package that will allocate $15 million to this devastated region. In answer to a question from his own side, Senator Collins in the Senate in the previous sitting week tried to draw some sort of distinction between the way in which New South Wales and Queensland were treating this money. There are differences at the margin, that is true, but the reality on the ground in terms of the take-up rate is virtually indistinguishable. On many occasions, the minister takes one little kernel of truth, blows it right out and tries to build a big story out of it, when 99 per cent of what he says is nonsense. He did this again in the Senate last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $5 million for small business that New South Wales is providing to drought areas has now been taken up with unbelievable demand. This is something that desperately needs to be put in the government's package today, I would suggest, because the New South Wales government, with its limited resources, cannot carry everything. There is still no federal government response to match this sort of money for the small business people. They are really the forgotten victims of this drought, as I pointed out was the case in Moree. The New South Wales government is acting and its efforts are well regarded. The rural community, small business and farm families await effective action from this government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The continual campaign of utter deceit that is being run on this issue is astonishing. I took the trouble of accessing Mr Marks's letter. This is the sole information on which the opposition is relying for its newly invented policy of supporting the third runway whilst continuing to support the continued use of the east-west runway&mdash;a piece of nonsense, as any reference to the EIS on this third runway will demonstrate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been clear from day one that there would be a diminished use of the east-west runway as soon as the second parallel runway was commissioned. It was canvassed in the calculation of the EIS, which is fairly accurate, that there would be a net reduction in the number of people seriously affected by noise because it would benefit those who were living on the east and west of the airport, which is exactly what has happened. I ask those opposite to tell me how we can accomplish that end without diminishing the use of the east-west runway. It is a logical nonsense. The entire opposition campaign is based on a letter from Mr Marks that was written, I think, last year.</PARA>

This morning I met a number of business delegates at a breakfast in Melbourne for the national trade investment outlook conference, a very successful conference which Senator McMullan is hosting and which focuses world attention on Australia as an investment location.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In launching the promotion booklet entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia: your strategic investment location</EMPHASIS>, I was able to cite that it is not just the Australian government that is out there making a case for Australia as a site for international investment. For example, a major international accounting firm, Price Waterhouse, is now advising its clients that Australia is just such a location. In a most recent brochure it has said of Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's comparative cost advantage in the region is expected to continue to grow over time. It will continue to be one of the major incentives for multinational groups to establish regional functions in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>As to that part of the question which asks, `How well does Australia stack up as a location for investment?' I can say that salary costs for qualified professional executives in this country are 59 per cent more competitive than in Singapore and 50 per cent more competitive than in Hong Kong. Australian universities and colleges turn out three times more engineers than Hong Kong and Singapore combined, six times the scientists and 10 times the economists and business management graduates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost of locating in Australia is highly competitive, with a typical expatriate package in Australia costing 50 per cent less than in Singapore or Hong Kong. Office space in this country is up to half the cost in Singapore and one-third the cost in Hong Kong. Our world-class telecommunications infrastructure also gives us significant cost and quality advantages. Our lifestyle, original science and the availability of a pool of multilingual professionals competent in all of the Asian and European languages also are key attractions. People are surprised to learn that Australia has a competitive advantage in the breadth of Asian languages and Asian language support over both Singapore and Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of what international investors are finding compelling about Australia is the advantages that our integration with the fast growing Asia-Pacific economies gives us as a base for regional operations, and part of what influences their commercial decisions is the strength of our own economy. At 6.4 per cent a year, we now enjoy probably the fastest growth rate among the advanced industrialised economies. In the 12 months to September, quarterly productivity has grown by four per cent in this country; employment by 3.4 per cent; real household disposable income by 3.9 per cent; and inflation is at a low level of 1.1 per cent over that period. So we have strong growth of output, business investment, employment, productivity, real household disposable income and savings&mdash;all with low inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of Noel Fitzpatrick's remarks. I am also aware of the level of effort that is being directed at the problems that Senator Lees referred to. It should be pointed out that the Murray-Darling Basin Commission as it currently exists is a joint Commonwealth-state program, as it has to be. The states of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are inextricably linked in any proposal that deals with that area of Australia which is our most productive, but which also has some major problems associated with it. It is a joint initiative.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth contributes in the order of $20 million a year to the initiatives and that is matched by state expenditure. The total budget is around $70 million per year. Nationally, through the national landcare program, the Commonwealth contributes $105 million through the primary industries and energy portfolio alone to address landcare issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are significant problems in the MDB that need to be addressed, but I also point out that resource degradation in Australia is not a problem confined to the basin. I have to say, regrettably, that one aspect of this drought in some areas of Australia is the feeling that all the problems currently being experienced by farmers are caused by the drought. Unfortunately, many of those problems are simply exacerbated by the drought.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen just recently extensive areas where there is massive environmental damage. A lot of that has been caused by previous overstocking, block sizes being too small and so on, and this has been exacerbated by conditions that could not be described as exceptional in drought terms. But, because of the underlying problems, the effect of those factors has been massive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a major national problem&mdash;I know Senator Lees is well aware of this&mdash;similar to the problems that are in the Murray-Darling Basin Commission. Competition for funds in the forthcoming federal budget will be severe. Any proposals for an expansion of funding made by the MDB Commission would need to make a strong case as to why additional resources should not be directed, for example, into the national landcare program or other national priorities. I point out that any funding proposals would have to have the support of the states, which are partners in every sense in the Murray-Darling Basin Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission in its current form&mdash;this is relative to the last part of Senator Lees's question&mdash;has existed only since 1988.

As to the problem Senator Lees mentioned about the estimate of the number of hectares, that is based on the assumption that nothing is done to prevent it.

However, section 100 of the constitution clearly shows that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility to guarantee water quality and flow to South Australia. Therefore, if there is an algal bloom this year in South Australia's section of the River Murray, as 97 per cent of the nutrients are already in the river when it goes past Renmark, surely the minister would accept that it is the Commonwealth's responsibility. Therefore, far more resources than are now being put in to the Murray-Darling Basin Commission&mdash;as well as to Landcare and other sources&mdash;are needed to ensure that both water quality, in terms of nutrient levels, and salinity are far better than they are now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish it was as neat as that and that we could attribute the blame for particular algal blooms to one bit of the river. We cannot do that. I point out to Senator Lees that, as a direct result of the drought alone, no water has passed through the mouth of the Murray River for three months. The river mouth is progressively closing. If no further significant rain is received in Australia&mdash;and it is not looking very hopeful at the moment&mdash;during the course of this summer, the mouth of the Murray is expected to close completely.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the sort of question that one could take most of question time to answer. However, I will just answer it in the context of the theme that Senator Cook was talking about in his answer to a question. The question is timely in the context of the national trade and investment outlook conference that Senator McMullan has been involved with and the theme of that conference, which is creating networks for global business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the increasing globalisation of Australian business, with some 90 per cent of our exports now going to non-English speaking countries, Australia needs to look at how we can best maximise our opportunities. In that context, we have an enormous resource&mdash;that is, our cultural diversity&mdash;and the government is committed to fully exploring and exploiting this resource. The Prime Minister, speaking at the conference this morning, made a point of saying that the government is implementing strategies to make productive economic use of this particular resource and to make productive diversity integral to our trade and investment strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point is very much that there is not one country in the world with which we wish to trade whose language and culture we do not have living within our own community. For this reason, in the context of making productive diversity an integral part of our trade and investment strategies, the government has commissioned the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to conduct the first comprehensive study of our ethnic chambers of commerce and other business bilateral associations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study was funded by Senator Cook's department and the Office of Multicultural Affairs. It set out to identify the extent of the resource. It also set out to identify the potential for this resource in terms of networking and information sharing with mainstream business organisations. Senator Cook and I were able to launch that report this morning to coincide with the conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at the outcomes of that research study conducted by the ACCI. The database we launched this morning is the first database of Australian bilateral associations to be launched in this country. The study found that Australia has a wealth of more than 170 bilateral associations, covering some 58 countries. Most of them are state based. Some 40 or so are in New South Wales. I think there are 36 in South Australia; 26 in Victoria; 22 in Western Australia; at least 6 in Queensland; and three in both Tasmania and the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, it should also be recognised that these associations are open associations between those overseas-born experienced people with backgrounds in both the culture and the language of countries in which they are interested and those in the Australian community who have a mutual interest with the former category in expanding trade between Australia and other countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context also, the study found that there is not one region in the world with which we wish to do trade that is not covered by these bilateral associations. Sixty-three of them relate to the Asia-Pacific region; 76 to Europe; 16 to the Middle East and Africa; and 17 to the Americas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we find in this database, in the study, is a total reflection of the benefits and of the sources of our migration program. The number of associations and the diversity of the regions they cover reflect both the source countries of our migration program and the growing commercial ties between those countries as major partners with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The database is not a one-off. It builds on an ongoing agenda&mdash;an agenda which the government is committed to pursuing with the ACCI and with other peak industry organisations.

Thirdly, as it is likely that the welfare agencies will not be able to fully cope with demand for their services over Christmas, where else can these people go for assistance?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Woodley for this question. I can tell him that it is not possible to be sure about the numbers, particularly in advance, of how many people might indeed be affected by a deferment period during Christmas. The latest figures that I have been provided with show that in the month of September there were 2,824 penalties imposed for administrative and activity test breaches. I am not sure what conclusion one could draw from that but that is a figure that might help Senator Woodley.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the second question of whether the government recognises that withholding a person's income support forces a person into a life of abject poverty, that is not quite an accurate conclusion. The DSS or CES do not arbitrarily impose a deferment period for either administrative or activity test breaches. In the case of activity test breaches, a person is interviewed to determine the reason for the failure of the activity test before the breach and before the deferment period is imposed. When the person can provide a reasonable explanation no breach is imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A breach may also be imposed if people do not respond to attempts by the departments to contact them and in such instances they are given clear notice that they are required to contact and so on. So the concern is much as we were discussing this morning in a slightly different context, namely, balancing justice with mercy, if I could put it like that. We do make the penalties quite clear in the legislation and what people who offend or break those legislative requirements will suffer by way of penalty. Both the DSS and the CES are concerned that the deferment penalties are never placed by accident or for an insufficient reason and, again, if there is any reasonable explanation then, of course, no breach is imposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the third question of where else people can go if they are in fact found to be in breach and therefore lose their income, it is important to know that the poverty or difficult circumstances people might find themselves in can mean that the CES or DSS manager could authorise continuation of the payment for a period, particularly pending any review of the decision if there was a breach. It is also important to note that the majority of breaches are for voluntary unemployment or through misconduct at work and being put out of employment. Some 2,000 of the figure of 2,800 for September that I gave were for those sorts of reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even though a person can be disqualified from a jobsearch or a newstart allowance, it does not preclude the person or the person's partner from being able to claim other forms of income support such as family payments. And the partner of a disqualified person may also claim a payment in his or her own right, such as special benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point Senator Woodley raises is a very difficult matter of judgment. If people do offend against the requirements of social security or the employment provisions that are in place, the government cannot disregard those breaches. It must properly go through the process with as much concern and care for those people as possible. But, in the end, if one is confronting a breach then, clearly, the penalty must be addressed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interestingly enough, I was asked an identical question at a meeting of bankers which I addressed in Sydney at 7 o'clock this morning. The answer is very simple. It needs to be said also that the drop in wheat prices may be of concern to the wheat growers but it has been greatly welcomed by the people buying it to feed their stock. The wheat harvest is well advanced. Quality and protein levels are above average for the bulk of the wheat being delivered to receival points. One of the by-products of the lack of rain is that it has actually increased the protein levels in some wheat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Current indications are for a reasonable summer sorghum crop in New South Wales and Queensland of about a million tonnes. ABARE's next crop report is due out next week. Cash prices for prime hard and hard wheats have been volatile, peaking at about $350 a tonne in Queensland in October. They have fallen significantly over recent weeks as most domestic millers in Australia have covered their immediate needs for high protein.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International wheat prices have eased and the prospect of imports&mdash;and this is an important factor which it has been interesting to follow over the last four or five weeks&mdash;of milling wheats has brought the markets back towards import parity. In fact, after the government made it absolutely clear very publicly that we would be approving, if necessary, significant imports of overseas grain once the price went above import parity, within two weeks the price had started to ease significantly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Growers with supplies of prime hard and hard wheats, including in the Tamworth district, still have the option of sales for cash or into the AWB pools. The Australian Wheat Board advised me today that estimated prime hard pool returns have remained at about their current level of $310 a tonne on an FOB delivered port basis for at least the last month. Equivalent cash prices are currently within $10 a tonne of the pool price. The recent substantial movements in cash prices reflect the volatility of the high protein wheat market around harvest time. It needs to be recognised that the Australian Wheat Board is only one of a number of buyers that are currently buying wheat in a deregulated wheat market in Australia.</PARA>

We are also concerned that they do face the death penalty. This is based, of course, on our resolute opposition to capital punishment in all circumstances in all countries.

Our ambassador was advised in response to these representations that the prosecutor, in seeking to lay charges against the parliamentarians, took into account a substantial body of evidence linking them to the terrorist activities of the PKK.

We are concerned with the process that was involved in the bail question, and that continues to be the subject of representations. But, on the basis of the material that I have personally seen so far and, I repeat, about which I have received advice, there does not seem to be any basis on which a further appeal by the government at this stage would be either productive or appropriate. I obviously share the concern that the family has for Mr Bowra in this matter and would like to be able to do more, but we do have to respect proper process when it is operating in other countries, as, by and large, it seems to be in this instance.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is different if something seems to have gone fundamentally wrong so far as process is concerned or there is some other reason&mdash;as, for example, in the Peng case in China, to which I referred in the estimates committee&mdash;to make one think that a government to government appeal would be appropriate.</PARA>

At Logan Airport, a common configuration involves the simultaneous use of parallel runways 4L/R for arrivals and departures, and Runway 9 (which crosses the approach-end of Runway R4) for departures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Primarily, these operations are conducted in weather allowing visual separation standards to be used by tower controllers and pilots. Crossing/intersecting runway procedures are used both to enhance capacity and equitably distribute noise exposure among surrounding communities. FTA has developed a computer program for Logan Airport which provides recommendations on configuration use. The recommendations consider projected demand, runway capacity, and cumulative noise exposure. We would be happy to provide additional information on this program at your request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although simultaneous use of crossing/intersecting runways may increase controller workload and airspace complexity, the opposite effect is also possible. This can occur when the additional runway capacity is used to segregate arrivals from departures or smaller aircraft (e.g., commuters) from air carrier jet traffic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further consideration of the unique situation at Sydney would be necessary before conclusions regarding the position of the Australian Civil Aviation Authority may be made. However, we can say that internationally accepted standards exist for the simultaneous operation of crossing/intersecting runways and, as such, these standards should allow for the safe and efficient operation of Kingsford-Smith International Airport as has been the case in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since we delivered our report in 1989, changes have undoubtedly occurred in many of the input parameters used in our model. FTA's Flexible Airport Simulation (FLAPS) is a highly advanced program capable of modeling complex combinations of runways, separation standards, fleet mixes, and demand levels. Updating the FLAPS capacity estimates using current information on these parameters along with the finalized third runway location may be desirable. Please let us know if we may be of further assistance.</PARA>

The only international operator that is cleared for simultaneous operations as a result of this incident is Qantas&mdash;and none other, still to this day. It really angers me, with this campaign that this lot have been running all year about aviation safety, to hear Senator Parer come in here and, because it is a convenient political argument, blithely dismiss the potential safety problems of operating intersecting runways at the busiest airport in Australia.

He should ask them about the relative safety&mdash;not the workability&mdash;of operating a two parallel runway system or a three intersecting simultaneous operation system. It is not an argument he wants to hear, but I have to say that it makes an absolute mockery of the crocodile tears that the opposition is crying both here and in the other house about its concern about aviation safety.

It has been pointed out by a colleague who has read the Laurie Oakes article, which I have not had time to read, that the article referred to the original cabinet decision in 1989.

<PARA>For quite some considerable time now the government has been allowing the Department of Human Services and Health to carry the can for making a decision to exempt the drug RU486 for the purposes of importing the drug. That decision was made in March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, at estimates committees, by inference, the department has more or less expressed regret at making that decision, which was contrary to undertakings that were given and policy decisions that were made. One month before then, Senator Crowley wrote a minute to Dr Vaughan, the National Manager of the Therapeutic Goods Administration, indicating that the TGA should treat any application for RU486 in the same way as for any other drug. The first line of the minute says, `The TGA sought guidance'&mdash;I interpret here that it is guidance from the minister&mdash;`on how to deal with an application from the sponsor of RU486 for marketing approval as an abortifacient.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to me, the minister talked about how the drug had possible uses for ailments. This minute dealt with the drug as an abortifacient. The minister was trying to mislead the chamber and the country on a very important matter. We now have to judge whether the department officials are properly carrying the can. Of course, that approval was for a CTN. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the sort of favourable advice that the minister had given just one month prior to the decision of the department, I suppose one could see that had an ameliorating affect on the decision. One therefore has to decide, in this International Year of the Family, who is responsible for the fact that the abortion drug RU486 has been imported into Australia because, quite obviously, the minister does not distinguish between this life-destroying drug and other drugs, many of which are life-affirming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter that should be considered not only by the parliament as such but by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). Here is the Minister for Family Services in this International Year of the Family making that sort of decision. She is giving the department the message to treat this drug in the same way as any other drug when, of course, that drug is a prohibited import as an abortifacient. </PARA>

<PARA>I say at the outset that I implore Senator Gareth Evans to look carefully into this matter. I ask him to look at the appeal papers himself and, in particular, to look at the areas that I mentioned previously&mdash;that is, the lack of opportunity for defence counsel to take evidence on a matter which was not believed to be a charge at that time; and, furthermore, the process by which the fourth charge was brought. Mr Bowra might be up for release in June, but incarceration is always very serious&mdash;very serious indeed for his family, his business and himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to perhaps put in the same effort as what it is putting into the Peng case. I understand fully the reasons for that; I applaud the government for what it is doing in that case. But I fail to see why the government cannot put the same sort of effort into the Bowra matter. After all, I believe that there are some matters here which need looking into. The bail question was the first and most notable one where the court ordered Mr Bowra to be released on bail, but the police would not abide by the court order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to put the effort into one matter and not into the other. Saying that some of these matters are really grounds of appeal or usual grounds of appeal really does not suffice in this matter. A plea from the highest level of the Australian government to the government of the United Arab Emirates could go a long way to assisting Mr Bowra's cause. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that on the 10th of this month there is a hearing to set an appeal date. That is merely a formality. The appeal date could be some months after that. To say, `Leave it to the appeal process,' is not good enough because, quite frankly, that will take some time. Even if it is a couple of months, two months in gaol is two months too much if it can be avoided. I am sure that if representations were made by the Australian government, they would be well received by the United Arab Emirates. I am sure that country would not have a deaf ear to any plea from a very senior level of the Australian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further ask Senator Evans to look at the advice that has been given to him by his department and ensure that it, in turn, is advised by people on the ground in Abu Dhabi, particularly Mr Bowra's lawyer, who was instrumental in putting this appeal together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the situation is one which perhaps the government might not regard as being at the top of its list. It is not a heavy sentence. It is a matter which does not involve life or death. The fact is that there are no aspects of abduction or anything by the authorities. There is nothing as dramatic as that. But I do say this: it involves the imprisonment of an Australian national overseas. It involves an allegation of irregular process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter how long the term of imprisonment is, it is a matter of grave concern for this man and his family. It is of great concern to Australians in the wider community because, after all, this could happen to any one of us. It was a simple accident which caused this man's misfortune. It is something that any one of us, or anyone who is near and dear to us, could find ourselves being involved in overseas. I ask the government to bear that in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to just add a word or two to what I said in answer to Senator Ellison at question time. I have had occasion to check with my office. It does appear that the appeal documents, the detailed documents, were sent to my office the day before yesterday, but for one or other reasons to do with the absence of the relevant person in my office, they have only just come to the notice of the relevant person and me, as a result of Senator Ellison's question at question time. So we lost a day and a half. But I certainly will undertake to look at that material myself and get further advice on it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The relevant consideration is whether there has been some irregularity of process, such as to constitute prima facie an improper process, an absence of the kind of reasonable due process that we would expect, or, indeed, a miscarriage of justice. All sorts of process considerations can arise which are essentially the kind of stuff of which ordinary legal appeals are made&mdash;such as technical misapplications here or there&mdash;and I think Senator Ellison would know that. There must be some limits on the extent to which governments can be expected to intervene in normal judicial process where these things are working themselves out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think I stated clearly enough the kinds of criteria or ground rules we apply when I answered a number of questions from Senator Ellison on this subject in the estimates committee hearing. I repeat: I acknowledge that there is an area in which it is proper for governments to take action. Certainly, we have done that already in relation to the bail matter. I am happy to check it out further in light of the material which has just now come to hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to appreciate that, on the face of what I have seen so far, there is a significant difference between this case and the Peng case. The latter involves a capital charge, with the man actually facing death if charges are proven and the Chinese law works itself out. We also have a situation where he has been incarcerated for some 13 months without any process at all visibly occurring&mdash;no formal charges having been laid. We also have the circumstance of an apparent abduction, or certainly some serious misapplication of process in getting him to China in the first place. On the face of it, there is a whole series of grounds there for justifying quite a high level of governmental concern from a very early stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UAE case, to which Senator Ellison refers, is a most unfortunate one but it does not seem to be in the same league as the Peng case on any of those criteria. Nonetheless, I am not prejudging the issue of irregularity and mis-process. If I am satisfied that there is something of the kind that would justify government action on the basis I have indicated, we will take action accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>On 7 June 1994 the Senate referred the matter of the administration and funding of CSIRO's rural research to the Senate Economics References Committee. This reference arose because of the concerns of both scientists and the rural community that CSIRO was attempting to meet budgetary constraints through asset sales and staff reductions in a way that had become highly detrimental to rural research. In particular, there was a serious concern about a set of proposals that had been made in May this year by the Institute of Animal Production and Processing to sell several CSIRO field research stations and laboratory sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this was the catalyst for the inquiry, the Senate referred a range of broader issues to the committee for examination. These other issues included: the structure and administration of CSIRO; the influence of private funding on the effectiveness and direction of research; aspects of CSIRO's commercialisation process; and the effectiveness of communication between CSIRO and the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received 166 submissions to the inquiry. Seventy of those submissions were from CSIRO scientists in personal capacities. Other submissions were received from universities, CRCs, government organisations, community and business organisations, graziers, members of parliament and individual citizens. This high level of interest was a reflection of the concern that these people held about the future of one of Australia's best-known and most successful organisations. The fact that almost half the submissions received came from within CSIRO is indicative that there are indeed serious issues to be resolved, and the report draws extensively on the submissions and evidence provided to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, these submissions, while they put heavy emphasis on the range of problems currently being felt by rural research scientists, also made a positive contribution by making suggestions as to the steps that need to be taken to ensure that the standard of excellence that has been synonymous with CSIRO's name worldwide is maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry the committee made a particular effort to visit those field stations and laboratories where serious debate had arisen as to whether the properties should be sold. These inspections and the hearings held in conjunction with them gave the committee a very clear understanding of the issues involved. The committee met with CSIRO scientists, with stakeholders and with the beneficiaries of CSIRO research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will outline the committee's findings in a moment but, before I do, I emphasise that they are the unanimous findings of the members of the committee. This is a highly significant point, given the contentious nature of the reference and the fact that the structure of all Senate committees changed shortly after the matter was referred to the former industry committee to place the reference before the Economics References Committee, which is now chaired by the opposition rather than the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the outset, I wish to say that I am a great supporter of CSIRO and, as a former farmer, have been a beneficiary of its research. While much of the evidence that we received was in some respects critical of aspects of the organisation's operations, much was also positive. This aspect is reflected in our short title `The Case for Revitalisation'. The report picks up on many of the positive suggestions made in evidence. However, the title also makes it clear that, to achieve the goals that CSIRO sets for itself, changes will need to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence presented to the committee was very critical of the way that CSIRO is currently structured. Scientists in the rural institutes who gave evidence to the committee were unanimous that the structure of CSIRO was archaic, hierarchical and top heavy. Most of the criticism was directed at the institute level, and strong arguments were put to the committee that not only had the institute structure not been a success, but it had actually been most unhelpful to the organisation. Many submissions suggested abolishing the institute level of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence given to the committee argued that structural problems within CSIRO have resulted in barriers between research staff and administrators, a conflict between the line management and corporate responsibilities of institute directors, and difficulties in communicating with external funding agencies. Similar problems were presented to the committee concerning CSIRO's administration. These problems include: an excess of institute involvement in internal management matters; accountability and review such that scientists are now over-managed and under-resourced; claims that the management system is old-fashioned and inefficient; problems with promoting scientists to management positions; and division between research staff and management staff caused by the inequities in funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last three years the board has met on quite a number of occasions to set research priorities and to review internal administrative arrangements. Most recently the board has announced that it is conducting its own review of structural management and will report early next year. However, in the past these reviews have not led to any great change within CSIRO and have seemingly led to only a proliferation in management positions at the expense of research programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After considering all the evidence put before it, the committee came to the unanimous conclusion that CSIRO has been governed by an ineffectual board in that it has allowed a cumbersome and outdated management structure to remain in place, to the detriment of the organisation. The committee believes that the board must now move to address these problems in structure and administration. To achieve this, the committee has specifically recommended that the board must take a stronger role in the leadership of CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, the committee recommends that the board's current review of the management structure should, as a priority, restructure the CSIRO to reduce the layers of management, including the need to modify or eliminate the institute structure; introduce a business line model of structure based on having direct communication with the work places within CSIRO; set up a new administrative structure around the chief executive officer to replace the executive committee based on the board leaving internal administrative matters to the chief executive officer and such new structure; introduce a world best practice program of management across the organisation, including industrial participation; clarify its formal reporting mechanism to the minister; and, as part of this process of streamlining of administration, report on how excessive accountability can be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the committee is of the view that, if the CSIRO board is unable to address the foregoing reforms in its report, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) should consider establishing an independent assessment of the above proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee took evidence, it became clear that there is a crisis in rural research funding within CSIRO which has been brought on by the multiple effects of reduced appropriation funding, a downturn in the rural economy, increased competition from other public research organisations, an increased administration burden and, most importantly, a drop in the priority ranking of rural research within the CSIRO itself. In demoting rural research, the board made a decision which was inconsistent with its own priority ranking process and, in doing this, the committee believes, the board has acted in a manner inconsistent with its own stated goal of serving the public interest by maintaining a research effort in areas of national importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee agrees with the bulk of evidence put before it: firstly, the consequences of reducing rural research funding within CSIRO have already been and will continue to be extremely detrimental to some vital areas of rural research; and, secondly, there are many important reasons why Australia and in particular CSIRO should continue to give funding of rural research a high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message that the committee received in evidence was universal: in the nation's interest, the cuts in funding to rural research must stop and be reversed. Accordingly, the committee recommends that CSIRO reinstate the high priority ranking of rural research and ensure that the share of appropriation funding of rural research is increased commensurate with that ranking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the significant proposals made by the Institute of Animal Production and Processing. The committee is particularly concerned about the decision making processes associated with the property sales proposals that were the genesis of this inquiry. Let me make it clear that the committee accepts that the IAPP had to address its funding problems. However, the manner in which the institute approached proposed property sales was poorly thought through, caused great anxiety amongst staff and put offside the stakeholders who had originally contributed funds towards the purchase of the properties. As an example of decision making and communication, the property sales proposals left a great deal to be desired.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO's position on the proposals was never made absolutely clear to the committee. However, some decisions have now apparently been made by CSIRO not to sell the properties. The committee believes that CSIRO, having made these decisions, has an obligation to convey them to the interested parties, including scientists and stakeholders, as a matter of urgency. Independent of CSIRO's decisions, however, the committee has unanimously come to the conclusion that CSIRO should not sell the field stations at Longford and Arding in Armidale and Yalanbee in Western Australia and has recommended they be retained. The committee was also convinced that the laboratory site at Long Pocket in Brisbane held too much valuable infrastructure to be disposed of in the near future and has recommended that it also be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the institute's proposal to move part of the Division of Wool Technology from Ryde to Geelong, the committee concluded that there were both advantages and disadvantages associated with the move and that the decision was largely dependent on the future of wool industry funding. Accordingly, the committee has recommended that a decision be deferred until the direction of funding becomes clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because some divisions are highly dependent on external rural industry funds and because those funds have fluctuated considerably in recent years, the committee considered the issue of countercyclical funding&mdash;that is, the nexus between government and industry contributions to rural research which accentuates the peaks and troughs of agricultural production. This issue is far more complicated than it outwardly seems and, accordingly, the committee has recommended that CSIRO, in collaboration with industry and government, formulate a package of mechanisms to buffer research programs from wide fluctuations in rural industry research levies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which proposals for the property sales was handled by the organisation revealed that communications within CSIRO are less than adequate and the committee thus makes specific recommendations about the need for greater industrial democracy within the organisation and the need for staff representation on the board to assist in that process. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also took evidence on the role of communicators in the CSIRO and has concluded that CSIRO has failed to adequately define the role of its communicators and to ensure that they are adequately trained for that role. To overcome this, the committee has recommended that the role and responsibility of CSIRO communicators be more clearly defined and that CSIRO ensure that people employed as communicators either have the necessary skills to do the task or receive appropriate training for the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has also recommended that CSIRO ensure that those scientists who are required to communicate regularly with stakeholders and the public have the necessary skills to do so. In addition, the committee has recommended that CSIRO review the procedures used for the approval of media releases with a view to increasing the speed with which they can be issued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to external funding targets, the committee  believes that, while there have been significant benefits arising from the target figure of 30 per cent, particularly in focusing CSIRO towards the needs of industry, there have also been some considerable disadvantages. The committee believes that CSIRO has not adequately addressed these negative aspects and, more importantly, has not sufficiently taken note of the concerns of its scientists who pointed out the very real difficulties the targets have caused them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was clear to the committee that the demands of obtaining external funds are placing considerable stresses on scientists and that this is hampering their research. The committee considers that the CSIRO has taken a too rigid approach to external funding and should now have a more flexible attitude. The committee thus recommends that CSIRO address this problem by developing multidisciplinary teams within the divisions to assist with obtaining and retaining external funds. The committee further recommends that management play a stronger role in external fundraising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO has played a very active role in the commercialisation of its research over the last few years. There are signs, however, that in pursuing this goal CSIRO was not adequately prepared. The committee has concluded that CSIRO aggressively pursued commercialisation without first establishing a suitable structure and without adequately preparing its staff for commercial transactions. For this the board and the senior officers must be held accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite recent lessons in litigation, and despite the production of a commercial practice manual, the committee believes that CSIRO still does not have sufficient structures and mechanisms in place to prevent legal liability emanating from one area having a significant detrimental impact on other areas of CSIRO. The committee therefore recommends that the CSIRO board commission a study to determine further ways in which CSIRO can limit its legal liability arising from the commercialisation of its research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also recommends that CSIRO clarify its respective roles in commercialisation and development and make its policy in these areas clear to its staff and stakeholders. The committee believes that CSIRO has not sufficiently upheld its role in the adoption of research findings in the rural sector and has recommended that CSIRO examine ways in which research results can be transferred to the rural sector, given the demise of state extension services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the committee considered the broader concerns of CSIRO scientists and concluded that there are serious problems with employment security and a deterioration in conditions of employment within CSIRO. In some areas this is hampering the efficiency of its research scientists and is a major cause of low morale among its staff. The committee is concerned that if the CSIRO board continues to ignore this situation, increasing numbers of scientists will leave the organisation to work elsewhere. The final result will be that the critical mass necessary for efficient research will be lost in many areas vital to Australia's agricultural economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommends that the CSIRO board address the problems of employment insecurity, poor conditions of employment, low career status, excessive accountability, the stresses of fundraising, ineffective industrial participation and low morale amongst its rural research staff as a matter of urgency. Rural research has always been given a high priority by CSIRO. But with recent changes in priority status by the board, agricultural science is now at the point of crisis. Overall funding is inadequate, morale is poor and CSIRO is not attracting the quality people it must have for the continued future of good scientific research. The committee has concluded that if something is not done fairly quickly rural research is likely to suffer a further decline that will ultimately be detrimental to Australia's economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the secretariat, particularly our secretary Rob Diamond and Pippa Carron, who are both in the chamber at present, for their tremendous effort in what has been a very concentrated inquiry with a very large number of submissions and a very tight time frame to prepare this report. Their efforts have been noted by the committee and we certainly commend them for the effort that they have put into this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe personally that rural research has always been regarded as Australia's sacred cow, both within CSIRO and by the Australian community. The recommendations of this report have been made in an effort to ensure that our sacred cow does not become a sacrificial lamb. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to go over everything that Senator Ferguson so ably put to the chamber, but I will cover some sectors of the report of the Economics References Committee on the CSIRO. Some honourable senators may remember that it was my motion that got this inquiry going. At that time, Senator Childs was the chairman of the committee. It is one of those inquiries that we started with one chairman and finished with another, and both, of course, did a top class job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very disappointed that Senator Cook, the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, and Senator Collins are not in the chamber at the moment. My main reasons for proposing the inquiry were: the $20 million drop in rural funding for CSIRO in real terms; the shifting of priority for rural research; the selling off of research stations; and the fact that in 4 1/2 years, or thereabouts, this government had had four ministers for science, including Senator Schacht. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry was opposed by the NFF&mdash;for any good reasons unknown to me. It was opposed by Senator Cook and Senator Collins. These two senior ministers came into the chamber and tried for half an hour to shout down my motion to have this matter referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. It was also opposed by CSIRO chairman, Professor Adrienne Clarke, and by the CEO of CSIRO, Dr Stocker. I hope that Dr Stocker's attitude has changed somewhat, but I will come back to that later. It was also opposed by some of my National Party colleagues in this place. I think they have now seen the light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be interesting to some people, not all, how it came about that I got interested in this situation; I found out about some of these points a bit later. There is a fellow in Perth who works for CSIRO&mdash;and I will not name him for obvious reasons because I think CSIRO is suspicious of him enough already&mdash;who rang me and said that he knew me from somewhere in previous years. I could not remember him, but when I saw him he pointed out what he used to do; I had better not say where he used to work either. Before I met him, I said, `Look, meet me at the airport. I'll only have 20 minutes. If you can convince me in 20 minutes, well you've convinced me.' So he turned up, and I have never seen a fellow talk for 20 minutes so flat out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main things he told me was that Yallanbee in Western Australia&mdash;the research station at Bakers Hill&mdash;was to be sold off. Mr Deputy President, you might have seen it in your mining experience, or you might have seen the turn-off on the odd occasions you go through Bakers Hill. So, that was the reason. Yallanbee is a property of some 3,000 acres, close to Floreat Park where the scientists have their laboratories and animals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then followed that up and spoke to a nephew, Bernie Panizza, who has a Bachelor of Agricultural Science from the University of Western Australia. That is a good plug for him. He was doing experiments there at the time, and when he warned me I thought it was time to look into the matter. When I did look into the matter, I came up with these points. I really found out what was being done. Of course, there were other top research stations at Longford and Arding in Armidale in New South Wales, of which I got a good independent view from Ian Sinclair, a member of the other house. He told me that those two institutions were certainly well worth hanging on to. That is the reason that I decided to go for this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators have already been told by our chairman, we had 176 submissions from all around Australia. Of course, as Senator Ferguson already pointed out, those submissions mainly came from within CSIRO&mdash;CSIRO was leaking like a sieve. I believe that this must be somewhere near a record number of submissions. It is certainly the highest number of submissions that I have seen on any inquiry in the seven years I have been in this place. They were very good, detailed submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We started off hearings all around Australia, as Senator Ferguson already mentioned. The main thrust that came out of that was that the CSIRO board must take a stronger role in the leadership of the organisation. As pointed out, it was thought that there may be conflicting roles here because we were told at the inquiry that the CEO of CSIRO reports directly to the minister and also to the board, as would normally happen. In any commercial board, the CEO reports to the board. On examination of the act, it was discovered that that is not so. The CEO reports to the board and then the board is supposed to report to the minister. Exactly which member of the board reports to the minister is unclear. In a commercial organisation, Mr Deputy President, you would know that the CEO reports to the board and then if the board has to report to a minister it should be the chairman of that board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take the case of a large company that has subsidiaries, we have a board of the parent company and a board of the subsidiary. If we take CSIRO to be the subsidiary in this case, the CEO of the subsidiary reports to the chairman of the subsidiary. The chairman of the subsidiary then reports to the board. That is how I believe that this should be done. If it is not being done, from a reading of the act that seems to be the way it has to go. So that is where the board has to take a more proactive role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we heard in Melbourne from Dr Adrienne Clarke, who I was very impressed with, was that with the encouragement of this report that is the way it will all go. As Senator Ferguson already pointed out, restructuring of the layers of management obviously has to be done. I believe from looking at it, and I always look at most things with a commercial point of view, that there is a lot of room for improvement there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move to the point of reinstatement of the high priority ranking for rural research. To my knowledge CSIRO, and I do not think anyone would disagree with me, was set up exactly for that, for rural research, many years ago. Exactly how many, I do not know. The year 1926 or something like that has been mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is where the research should remain  because rural industries need&mdash;this is different from manufacturing industries and other service industries and communications&mdash;long-term research. I believe that long-term research can only be done in an organisation such as this that has long-term funding. Manufacturing, processing and communications&mdash;they all want quick results. Otherwise, by the time they get their research done, some other organisation has beaten them to the punch. So I believe that rural research has to go to the top of CSIRO's priority list again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also question the amount that is being spent on telecommunications research in CSIRO. In Australia we have Telecom, Optus and other electronic organisations and then there are the worldwide organisations such as AT and T, British Telecom, Italian Telecom and Motorola&mdash;all of those can do all the research for communications in the world without being duplicated too much by CSIRO. That is why I mention that we should have priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we need an independent study of rural levies. We need to know how they are applied to research and expansion and whether all industries and organisations which benefit from this research currently pay levies. I did not know that the horse industry did not pay any research levy whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had that big case in Queensland only a couple of months ago of that virus that killed 20 or 30 horses and a human life was lost. The authorities were able to call on CSIRO which got to the heart of the problem quickly and dealt with it. So I can see that in times to come there will have to be some sort of levy coming from that industry. My colleague in the other place, Mr Wilson Tuckey, as chairman of the galloping association of Western Australia, will probably not be too pleased at my suggestion, but it will have to come as well as a lot of others, including showjumping competitions.</PARA>

A good example in the last few years is the big downturn in wool prices that was caused by the disastrous reserve price scheme. The 1988-89 high prices caused a big build-up in the stockpile, and the industry collapsed. There was a big build-up in levies for wool research. I suppose that the CSIRO cannot be blamed for committing funds instead of putting some away for a rainy day. Not all woolgrowers thought that those prices would last forever, and the prices did collapse. Having been committed to research and having committed its funds, the CSIRO was not able to keep everyone going when the downtown came around. I will not go into it deeply now, but there has to be some way of achieving counter-cyclical funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO undertakes extension projects, where it conducts research and then gets outside organisations to develop its findings. It has had a couple of big losses. Cassegrain was one. The other one escapes me. </PARA>

The CSIRO employs 150 communicators.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue very vigorously that the nation gets an excellent return for its investment in science and technology, that there is a real need to recognise and continue to recognise the contribution of research and development in that innovation pathway, and that the privately funded research which I dealt on a little bit at my previous hearing needs to increase very sharply in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to think that both of those are enormously important in the national interest, and I would have thought that by the time my [hypothetical] appointment is announced in this new capacity it will be a time when CSIRO has a number of performance indicators against which it can report and justify a very strong case for a budget in each triennial negotiation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I thank Senator John Coulter of the Australian Democrats for his support in getting this motion up.

Perhaps this inquiry was not what he wanted&mdash;if he is listening in South Australia, I hope he hears that I am thanking him&mdash;but it went some way down the track towards achieving it.

In addressing this report, I will go back in the history of the CSIRO in terms of the benefit that the CSIRO has delivered to this country over a long time. I do not think anyone is under any misconceptions about the fact that it has been, and is, a very worthy organisation and that it has done tremendous work. Some of it has probably been immeasurable in dollar terms, particularly in the rural sector. I guess that it was for some of those reasons that this inquiry was started. Albeit I believe that it was partly political at the beginning, at the end of the day we may well have come up with something that may help the CSIRO into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been already stated, the inquiry received a huge number of submissions. Although they primarily came from three of the six institutes within the CSIRO, those submissions did raise a number of serious concerns. Those concerns related to the way in which the CSIRO was either structured or managed. It is my view that sometimes we find problems and we quickly point to the structure or the way in which the umbrella of an organisation is set out rather than analyse the management that operates within the structure. It is certainly my view, and I think the findings of the committee demonstrate it, that if we take a look at the overall structure of all the institutes we see that there are problems associated with the management of a number of institutes within the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board during its time has not necessarily had the input to the management or policy or strategy making of the CSIRO that it ought to have had. When the government set up the board&mdash;which was a change in the old act from an executive committee to a board structure with a chief executive officer&mdash;I think the members of the board did not realise what their task was. It certainly appears that they did not adequately carry out their responsibilities in ensuring that the CSIRO had a management system that would enable it both financially and strategically to deliver the results that it should be able to deliver to the country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the CSIRO research does not totally revolve around the rural sector. It is clear, as the nature of this country has changed, that research is relevant to a whole host of areas within the make-up of this country's industries and businesses. That has been a strategy that the government has set about during the course of its term in office. I would like to pick up the matter of funding and read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a statement by the minister which is contained at chapter 2.3 of the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, the Honourable Senator Peter Cook, has stated that `the base level funding for CSIRO has been increased from $418.9m in 1993-94 to $442.3m in the 1994-95 budget. During the 1991-94 triennium, in addition to base level funding, there were three special allocations by the Commonwealth to CSIRO to replace outdated equipment and upgrade building assets. These allocations were clearly intended to apply to that triennium only. In the 1994-95 budget, however, the Government decided that CSIRO would permanently retain part of these special one-off allocations, thereby increasing the base level funding for the Organisation. As a consequence, CSIRO's 1994-97 triennium funding represents a real increase of about $20m per annum in base level funding'.</PARA>
<PARA>The government grants to the CSIRO a one line appropriation. This is where we really started to find the problems with regard to funding for rural research. The board makes the decisions on the allocation of that appropriation across its various institutes depending on which areas of research it finds the most attractive. The executive committee is now made up of the directors of the institute and the CEO, as I understand it&mdash;and I think evidence has shown&mdash;did make recommendations to the board with regard to the funding allocations, and the board did indeed overturn two of the three recommendations in respect of rural research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I had a view at the start of this inquiry that it was somewhat politically motivated and aimed at the government with respect to funding, but during the course of it we started to find things that were very pertinent and relevant to the CSIRO in the way it has operated. One of the things that other senators have raised already is its commercialisation. It is clear from the fact that CSIRO has already suffered significant losses through settlements of litigation that it still does not have sufficient protection and skills within its organisation to enter the field of commercialisation that it is endeavouring to enter into or has entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee recommended with regard to rural research a proposal for counter cyclical funding in that it be looked at in conjunction with industry and other bodies to see whether or not there may be a possibility of organising counter cyclical funding for commodity prices and/or climatic changes which cause downturns in certain sectors of the rural industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was another recommendation with regard to the CSIRO and the funding of it, particularly from an external point of view, and one that I think is very worthwhile. That related to the contribution of post farm gate industries that receive significant benefits from CSIRO research but make little or no contribution. On page 39 of the report, paragraph 2.62 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Government commission an independent study of the system of rural levies, which would focus on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.(i) how they are applied to research in both on-farm and post-farm sectors, and;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">.(ii) how the system could be expanded to include<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">industries not currently contributing to, but benefiting from, CSIRO research.</PARA>
<PARA>I think those things are very worthy. If we are to have a national research organisation such as the CSIRO, it is important that not only the public of Australia understands but certainly the other industries in this country understand that if we are to get to the forefront and to maintain that place in research terms, it will take a contribution from everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important point that has been touched on is that of communication within the CSIRO and with its stakeholders and the general public. It is quite clear from evidence that we took with regard to the decision making process that has to be gone through for press releases of findings or other things that may have happened within the CSIRO that the process is inadequate. It just takes too long. Journalists outside CSIRO identified very clearly that quite often by the time they get information on particular findings their newsworthiness has passed. From a public promotional point of view, that is another very serious aspect that has to be addressed within the CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the other very important element of industrial democracy. It was very clear from the evidence we received from a very large number of scientists and other people who work for the CSIRO that they feel that industrial democracy of the type that we should have in this country today clearly does not exist within CSIRO. There were very good examples of that in the way in which notices were issued to staff with regard to decisions that may be going to be taken or may have already been taken. They clearly showed that the CSIRO really has a long way to go in addressing the type of industrial processes that should exist in this country today, particularly if we look at the types of enterprise bargaining arrangements that are being put in place in other industry sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said that I only wanted to make a few brief remarks. Some of the evidence we received clearly showed that some members of management have a lot to answer for and I certainly think that the board has not really lived up to what should  and could be expected of it. I make one comment with regard to the chief executive officer's statement that he felt he had a conflict of interest in having to report to two masters. I want to reiterate what was said earlier, that the act requires the CEO of the CSIRO to report to the board and the board to the minister. In fact, under the act, the board is required to provide to the minister a strategy for up to a five-year period. The CEO is then required to provide an operational plan to the board on an annual basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the evidence we received and the replies to the questions we asked, it appears that little has come out of the internal review processes that the CSIRO conducted itself. Yet, there were clearly problems existing. It is almost a shame that some of those people have not addressed the issues. There seems to have been a lot of infighting at senior management level, and this has had a detrimental effect on the overall operation of the CSIRO, particularly within two of the key institutes in the rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those are the things which must happen if we are to see changes brought about by the CSIRO. Some of the scientists said to me, `It would not matter if we had another $100 million; the problems would still exist.' Therefore, it is not just a question of funding; it is a question of management getting its act together and the board actually doing its job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there should be communication down to the shopfloor level in CSIRO, because many of the scientists also said that they had many ideas about how CSIRO could operate and still deliver the goods within the budget that it received. Yet they were never given the opportunity to contribute to the decision making process. If this report is to be taken account of&mdash;and I hope it will be&mdash;at the end of the day we will see a better managed, much more efficient and, I hope, more communicative CSIRO, one that ensures greater participation of its work force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank those honourable senators who have cooperated and allowed me to speak now about the CSIRO report. I acknowledge the remarks made by Senator Murphy. He said that when the terms of reference on this issue were first referred to the committee to be dealt with, it may have started off as a bit of a witch-hunt against the government because the reference was on a narrow basis about the funding in the rural sector. But the committee, whose unanimous report is before us with recommendations made on a tri-partisan basis, got very quickly into wider issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former science minister, I believe that most of the major issues in this report, particularly about management structure, are relevant. I say to Senator Murphy and Senator Ferguson that, in some ways, I consistently raised the problem of the structure within CSIRO during 1993 when I was minister. Though I have not had much time to read the report since it was tabled an hour ago, there is much in the recommendations about structure and the descriptions that go with it for careful consideration, not only by the government but also by the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that the CSIRO structure is too top heavy. That was an issue I raised with it. Unless we can get more flexibility and discretion in the way it is managed in the new paradigms of the way science and applied science are conducted in Australia, we will not get a good return for the community's $500 million investment each year in CSIRO. The remarks made by one of the witnesses, Professor Jerry Freed, quoted in paragraph 1.31 on page 8 of the report, are very pertinent. These were issues I raised with the CSIRO management that could not be ignored for the future. Professor Freed said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The newer structures [of other organisations], which are very parallel and involve a lot of people working together across disciplines, seem to be working much better. It is difficult for CSIRO to fit in with those because it has a culture which is based on a very vertical command structure.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a very apt description of the problem CSIRO has. Unfortunately, there is a large conservative element in CSIRO committed to the present structure because of the status, and ego and career commitments that go with the work. But, if CSIRO stays with the present structure, we will never get the best return for the community's investment. Above all else, we will not get the best out of the scientists who work in CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was involved in some controversy last year when I suggested that maybe the best way to get research going in the marine area was to create a new marine institute separate from CSIRO with a couple of its divisions being added to it. The main argument raised by CSIRO management against that was that this would break down the interdisciplinary arrangements within CSIRO. This report clearly shows that there are not enough interdisciplinary arrangements across institutes or divisions. That was the issue I tried to raise with CSIRO last year without much success, in view of the response it made publicly. A fundamental issue about getting discrete flexible science is to have multidisciplinary approaches. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the report there is strong criticism of the institute structure that was proposed by the McKinsey report a few years ago. I think that criticism is correct in many ways. An extra level of management is being put in with no clear definition of good management or what they are doing&mdash;whether they are putting another level of managers in per se. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question to be looked at is, if the institute structure is removed and it goes back to the old divisional structure that many people in CSIRO seem to want, unless there are clear structures, will there be divisions running themselves as little feudal cells separate from everybody else? That will only exacerbate the problem. The real issue in CSIRO's structure is to break down the vertical silos and go horizontal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the great challenge for an organisation with 7,000 staff and a budget all-up of $700 million plus&mdash;$500 million from the federal government. It is a challenge for the board, the chief executive and the senior management. Unless those challenges are taken on, as this report shows, in the long run, the community will not get the return it would expect from an investment that runs at about half a billion dollars a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators have to acknowledge that there are thousands of excellent scientists in CSIRO. The real issue is: what is the best way they can contribute to the development of a cleverer country&mdash;as we say in Australia&mdash;in technology and science and getting it out to industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that CSIRO is, above all else, an applied research agency to help industry&mdash;whether it is in the rural, manufacturing or environmental sector. No-one disputes that. John Stocker himself has said that; 90 per cent of the activities he sees at CSIRO involve applied research to help Australian industry, in whatever area, develop new ideas and techniques to help the output of Australia's economy. Some scientists in CSIRO think it ought to be a pure research body, not applied. That is a fundamental dilemma that has to be sorted out. I think the parliament has been correct in the past by saying that CSIRO is an applied research organisation there to help industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big challenges for any agency the size of CSIRO&mdash;this is mentioned in the report and is part of my portfolio as minister for small business&mdash;is how do we help small and medium-sized enterprises get access to the wonderful, intellectual power that is within CSIRO in a sensible, sensitive and cost-effective way. That is one issue that people in CSIRO realise they have not yet developed well enough. It is a challenge for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO is able&mdash;quite rightly and very effectively in many cases&mdash;to draw up contracts and arrangements when dealing with a scientific research laboratory in a big company, such as BHP or CRA. But the very small companies often need a day's help on a little technological problem. How does one get that information, flexibility and quickness of response? That is a major challenge for CSIRO. It is not the only science organisation in the world faced with that challenge. In most of the industrialised world, organisations similar to CSIRO are facing that same difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that CSIRO's name is a very effective brand name. It is well received in the Australian community and overseas. However, my argument always will be that it is not the institution that is important, it is what it produces and how the people within it go about their business in providing that output. With this identified very vertically structured organisation, we are not getting the best output from the people within. People are more trapped into the structure and arguing over structure, not over science and technology developments. That is what we always have to be flexible about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report&mdash;from just a very quick read of the major recommendations&mdash;moved on to wider issues, thank goodness, from what was to be initially, I suspect, a bit of a witch-hunt about the funding of the rural sector. In that way, it has been very valuable. It is noted that it was a bipartisan report. All honourable senators from all sides agreed to the recommendations. They give the community, as well as the government, a lot of food for good thought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The background to this inquiry by the Senate Economics References Committee into the administration and funding of rural research of the CSIRO&mdash;the report of which has been tabled today&mdash;was the decision by the present federal Labor government to cut funding for the CSIRO by some $60 million in the last budget. The second issue which led to the inquiry was what appeared to be the redirection&mdash;either at the behest of the government or by a decision by CSIRO itself&mdash;of its research priorities away from rural industry towards, particularly, manufacturing and information technology.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those two facts&mdash;the reduction in funding and the redirection of priorities&mdash;were occurring despite the fact that, in all the evidence presented to the committee, it was shown that CSIRO research in the field of agriculture generates very high returns on investment. It was also happening despite the fact that the provision of government appropriation funds for the rural research undertaken by CSIRO is very important because of the large amount of public good that comes out of that research. Again, that is a contrast between the rural research side of CSIRO and the research that CSIRO might conduct into the other areas I mentioned such as manufacturing and information technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the rural sector that that public good research involves a very large degree of basic research, or what might be described as pure research. Mr Acting Deputy President, with your background in the history and philosophy of science, you would understand only too well the high priority that must be retained for basic and pure research. It was with those concerns and considerations that this inquiry was established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister Schacht said a few moments ago, despite the fact that the inquiry has found problems and difficulties in CSIRO that need addressing across a wide range of areas, nevertheless the basic funding problem has also been highlighted in this report. Certainly, the government cannot escape the blame that should quite accurately be levelled at it for its cut in funding to CSIRO and particularly for the reduced funding available to rural research within CSIRO. The report, despite the fact that it deals with other issues, as I said, still highlights the shortage of funds available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first issue which attention is drawn to in this report is the structure and administration of CSIRO. There was certainly a lot of evidence which we, as a committee, found justified, that the structure of CSIRO has become archaic, hierarchical and top heavy. That criticism was in particular directed at the institute level of the CSIRO, which a large number of witnesses regarded as being unhelpful to the success of the organisation. The conclusion of the committee was that there needs to be a flattening of the administrative structure of CSIRO, with one less layer of management in place in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also found certain difficulties with the relationship between the board and its responsibilities. In theory, the board answers to the government, but in practice it seems that it really does not answer to anyone. In fact, rather than acting as a true board&mdash;as would operate in the private sector&mdash;it has become far more involved than we believe is necessary in the day-to-day running of CSIRO and in what ought to be administrative and management decisions. Certainly, the board ought to reconsider its role with regard to CSIRO. Because a number of the board members are part time&mdash;in fact, I think all of the board members are part time&mdash;there are also conflicts that develop between their other responsibilities and their responsibilities as members of the board. One other shortcoming of the board, on which we were unanimous, was the absence of a staff representative to provide staff input. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred a few minutes ago to the problems with the structure at institute level. What has occurred in particular is that instead of the institutes providing, as we believe they ought to have been, advice and decisions on business systems and establishing the visions for their areas of responsibility, at the next level down, as with the board,  they have got too much involved in internal management issues and decisions which really ought to be the preserve of the division level of CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with the current structure of CSIRO is that both science and management have suffered because of the practice of promoting scientists into management positions. This has been done in part because the only way of ensuring that very competent scientists receive appropriate levels of reward and remuneration was to promote them out of doing scientific research and into management positions. The consequence is that they have been lost to scientific research because they have been forced to take over this management role for which, in most instances, they are ill-equipped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While scientists may make good managers, a lot of them do not. It is not their particular skill or perhaps their particular interest. Most scientists want to be involved in undertaking scientific research rather than in day-to-day management and administration. On the one hand, this promotion of scientists into management roles has deprived CSIRO of some of its best scientists in terms of their capacity to undertake scientific research while, on the other hand, it has provided poor managers for CSIRO. This is not only because many of them are basically ill-equipped to be managers, but also because they really have not received any proper management training. That is a difficulty that was clearly evident in our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already referred to the funding issue, and that was the second issue to which the committee directed its attention. Between 1983-84 and 1993-94, in real terms in 1993-94 dollars, appropriation funding for CSIRO declined by almost $100 million from $562 million to $467 million. That paints very starkly the neglect of the government with regard to funding for CSIRO. On the other hand, research levies charged to rural producers increased by about $60 million annually over that period. Although the appropriation funding for CSIRO declined, the extra funding provided by rural industry research because of the increased funding from rural levies largely offset that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall funding available to CSIRO does not seem to have declined by a significant amount. Yet when we look specifically at appropriation funding, which is particularly important for rural research because of the public good aspect and the long-term nature of a lot of rural research, we see that certainly there has been a diminution of government responsibility in that area. For many years CSIRO strongly funded rural research because of the need to improve production and processing in agricultural industries, and because of the previous strong financial support from both the government and the rural industries themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to remember with CSIRO and its research in this area that a lot of our agricultural problems are unique: the nature of our soil is unique; our agricultural industries themselves are unique. Therefore, it is not possible to take the results of research off the shelf from other countries and apply them to Australia in the way it is possible to do that with a lot of manufacturing industries and other industry sectors where, because of the increasing globalisation of the international economy and the development of multinational companies, research in relation to manufacturing industry, information technology, and so on, can be imported from other countries. But with agricultural research in relation to Australia, that is simply not possible because of the unique nature of our agricultural environment and the agricultural industries themselves. Again, for that reason, it is very important that funding for rural research be given a very high priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the cuts in funding, the money actually available for rural research within CSIRO has also been eroded by the increasing burden of the administration and corporate management, as well as the devolution of the administrative support function down to the division levels. An increasing share of the funds that CSIRO has available to it is being eaten up in administrative support rather than going to real scientific research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are several factors that have contributed to the reduced funding. I have referred to the reduction of $100 million in real terms in appropriation funding provided by the government, but the downturn in the rural sector over the relevant period has also contributed to a reduced availability of funding from that area. As I said, there certainly seems to have been a shifting of priorities within CSIRO as regards the importance of rural research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That certainly appears to be at odds with CSIRO's stated priority for rural research. In terms of CSIRO's corporate plan and all its statements, it appears that rural research is still given a very high priority by that organisation. Yet, when we looked at the actual allocation of resources to rural research, we found it was sadly lacking. As I said, there is a clear inconsistency between the stated objectives of CSIRO on the one hand and the reality of the funding made available on the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that Australia at least maintains and ideally increases its overall commitment to rural research in the public sector, particularly if we are going to meet the objectives that this government has of providing the products of agriculture to the rapidly growing markets of Asia. We must retain a high level of rural research if we are to maintain the competitive advantage that we have in rural industry. If we maintain that competitive advantage, the whole of Australia will benefit from the additional markets that our rural producers obtain in Asia and other regions. Small cuts in research will significantly reduce our competitiveness with a consequently large impact on export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue that has emerged from this inquiry is the shift, even within the funds available for rural research, from on-farm research to post-farm gate research. Again, if we recognise the importance of maintaining sustainable agriculture, it is important that the emphasis on on-farm research is retained and its priority restored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the committee noted the importance of the levies which primary producers pay on the ad valorem value of their produce to provide funds for rural research, not only to CSIRO but through the various rural industry research and development corporations to universities, state departments of agriculture, and so on. Certainly, a significant part of CSIRO's funds comes from those levies but no equivalent levy is placed on manufacturing industry or other industry sectors. One of the conclusions of the committee is that some mechanism should be found to encourage manufacturing and information technology industries to contribute more to research in their particular industry sectors. Whether it is practical to apply levies to those industries is debateable but, certainly, a mechanism needs to be found to ensure that a much higher level of contribution from those industry sectors goes to CSIRO. I conclude on the funding issue by saying simply that the committee has found that CSIRO must reinstate the high priority ranking of rural research and ensure that its share of appropriation funding&mdash;funding from the government's own budget to rural research&mdash;is increased commensurate with that ranking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also looked very closely at the restructuring proposals for the Institute of Animal and Plant Production, particularly looking at the decisions which CSIRO had taken to sell a number of its research stations or field stations which are critical to the capacity of CSIRO to maintain its research efforts with regard to rural industry. Virtually without exception, we have recommended that the decisions taken by CSIRO&mdash;some of which have already been reversed in the course of our inquiry, largely as a result of the evidence given to the committee&mdash;be rescinded and that those research stations be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, we have recommended that the Division of Wool Technology postpone any decision to amalgamate its two laboratories until the future direction of the wool industry and funding from that industry becomes clearer. We have recommended the retention of the site and infrastructure at Long Pocket in Brisbane. We have also recommended the retention of the properties at Armidale, which go under the names of Longford and Arding, for the particular benefits that they provide to the animal industries. Also&mdash;this pleases Senator Panizza no end&mdash;we have recommended that the Yalanbee research station in Western Australia, with its Mediterranean climate farming research, also be retained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the inquiry, CSIRO tried to fudge the fact that it had taken decisions for sale, saying they were only recommendations for consideration, but the clear evidence was that decisions for sale were taken. We believe that those decisions were very short-sighted, not only because they would have meant the loss of the future benefit to rural industry of those research stations but also because in many instances CSIRO would have gained nothing from the sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we conducted our inquiry it became clear that a number of those research stations had been purchased with funds provided by the wool industry, the wheat industry, or by some other rural industry funds. In fact, had they been sold, most of the money derived from the sales would have had to go back to those industry funds rather than directly into the pocket of CSIRO. So CSIRO would not have gained any capital out of the sales and, in most instances, would not have achieved any great operating savings either. We believe that our recommendations were valid. As I said, it is pleasing that, by and large, CSIRO has already adopted those recommendations and has agreed not to sell those properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of importance to funding is that of counter-cyclical funding. When there is a downturn in rural industry and a downturn in returns to farmers, there is a consequential downturn in the income available through the research levies that farmers pay. To offset that, there should be a consequential increase in appropriation funding provided by the government through its budget. While it is difficult to formulate an easy formula for how the principle of counter-cyclical funding should be applied, the committee found that it should apply and that a strategy was required to assist those industries most vulnerable to wide fluctuations in research levy income. Whatever scheme is introduced&mdash;whether it is based on a rolling average or a system whereby rural industry research funds can accumulate reserves from which to borrow in periods of economic downturn&mdash;we believe it is essential that some form of counter-cyclical funding is made available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next issue to which attention was addressed was external funding. Since 1989 the federal government has required CSIRO to achieve a funding target of 30 per cent from external sources. There are certain difficulties with this. Most importantly, it is possible for CSIRO to lose control of the direction of its research. There is an administrative difficulty in that many scientists find they are spending more time obtaining grants and satisfying reporting requirements to the external bodies providing those grants than actually undertaking the scientific research itself. Therefore, there are significant shortcomings with regard to the principle of external funding. In fact, while the overall target for CSIRO of external funding is 30 per cent, we found that in some areas it was averaging over 50 per cent and, in an even smaller number of areas, 100 per cent, which, of course, made the job of scientists extremely difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">External funding also brings us back to the issue of fundamental, basic or pure science research as against applied research, which I mentioned earlier. Certainly, there is a tendency in the move towards externally sourced funding for research to become more applied and less fundamental and basic. While applied research is obviously very important, as I pointed out earlier, particularly with regard to primary industry, basic and fundamental research and the maintenance of effort in that field is also of great importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue that I want to deal with is communication. The committee found a number of shortcomings in the communication skills of the CSIRO. The CSIRO has a number of responsibilities as far as communication is concerned: it must communicate to the general public; it must communicate to the stakeholders, that is, under the external funding provisions, those people who are actually putting in the research funding up to or greater than the 30 per cent level; and it must communicate internally with its own research scientists and staff. In each of those areas we found significant shortcomings in communication skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, reputable journalists told us that it was very difficult to get positive stories out of CSIRO because of the maze of bureaucracy which had to be negotiated before approval could be obtained for particular details of a story to be released. Certainly, it is important that that bureaucratic approach to the release of information, which can provide a source of beneficial stories as far as CSIRO is concerned, is removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As some honourable senators have said in the debate today on this report, CSIRO has always been regarded as the pinnacle of scientific effort in Australia&mdash;an icon in the Australian community. It was sad that during the course of our inquiry it became clear that today many farmers and, indeed, peak farming organisations cannot name one benefit that they are currently obtaining from CSIRO. Going back 10 or 20 years, farmers could name benefit after benefit that they had obtained from the research undertaken by CSIRO and yet today they cannot do that. Again, it shows a dramatic shortcoming in the communication capacity of CSIRO today which obviously needs to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to internal communication, the fact that this matter had to be referred to a committee in order to highlight many of the shortcomings in administration, structure and funding of CSIRO and the fact that we received so many submissions from CSIRO scientists and staff themselves, again shows the failure of the senior levels of CSIRO to communicate adequately with the staff and scientists. Clearly, this is an area where experienced and skilled communicators&mdash;people with journalistic and other communication skills&mdash;need to be employed by CSIRO specifically to fulfil the role of communication so that the general public's image of CSIRO is maintained and therefore pressure can be maintained on the government for adequate funding; so that its stakeholders can continue to provide funds; and so that its employees retain confidence in the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">CSIRO has a history of being a very highly regarded organisation in Australia but that regard is somewhat tarnished as a result of shortcomings not only on the part of the government in respect of the funding that it has been providing in recent years and the direction that it has provided to CSIRO but also because of obvious problems with regard to the internal structure and management of CSIRO. This report has highlighted those, it has delved into them in great detail and its recommendations, I believe, are worthy of adoption. The fact that this is a multi-partisan unanimous report simply adds strength to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government to adopt these recommendations to ensure that CSIRO maintains its paramount position in the Australian scientific community. In particular, the recommendations should be adopted to ensure that the benefits to be derived from a continuing high priority to rural research not only for rural producers and farmers but for the whole community through the export earnings generated are maintained and increased in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL LAND RIGHTS (NORTHERN TERRITORY) AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill reflects the continuing commitment of this Government to securing legitimate title to traditional lands on behalf of the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in Schedule 1 of that Act may be granted to Aboriginal Land Trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 58 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the effect of this bill would be to bring within the Schedule to the Land Rights Act that area of land which is the subject of the Hodgson Downs Land Claim. The Northern Territory Government, the Northern  Land Council and Claimants in the Land Claim have entered into an agreement which settles that Land Claim. As part of that agreement the Northern Territory Government agreed to request the Commonwealth to exercise its powers under the Land Rights Act to grant the claim area, excluding the Hodgson River road and the Miniyeri Community access road, to the traditional owners by scheduling that area under the Land Rights Act. The result of such scheduling would be that no further hearing or report by the Aboriginal Land Commissioner would then be necessary in order for the Aboriginal people concerned to be able to have the full rights of enjoyment of their traditional lands in fee simple.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government has the assurance of all parties to the negotiations that representative views of all Aboriginal people concerned have been obtained and their wishes taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no financial implications arising from this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AGRICULTURAL AND VETERINARY CHEMICALS AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware that on 1 March 1994 parliament passed a package of seven agricultural and veterinary chemical acts. Commencement of those acts is dependent on the States and Northern Territory passing legislation adopting the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code (AGVET Code), and thereby commencing the national registration scheme for agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Five states, including the Northern Territory, have passed the necessary legislation. It is by no means certain, however, that the other two states will pass their legislation by 15 March 1995, which is the legislated commencement date for the AGVET Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a contingency, it is therefore proposed to extend that date to 1 July 1995 and thus provide additional time for the remaining two states to pass their legislation. The AGVET Code can of course be proclaimed to commence at any time before then, once the state legislation is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ARCHIVES AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Archives Amendment Bill 1994 will make amendments of a minor policy nature to the Archives Act 1983.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Archives plays an important role in ensuring that the history of Government in Australia is preserved and is available for access by future generations of Australians. These amendments are intended to clarify the application of the Archives Act to two types of records namely the records of Government Business Enterprises and other commercialised bodies and the records of the National Witness Protection Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, the amendments relating to Government Business Enterprises will result in indirect savings through improved efficiency in the process associated with the commercialisation, incorporation and sale of Government bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first category of amendments concern the application of the Archives Act to Government Business Enterprises. In the last few years, the Commonwealth has been reviewing the structure and operations of Government Business Enterprises. As a result, a number of these bodies have been commercialised, incorporated or privatised in order to improve the efficiency of their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the method used to incorporate or privatise these bodies in the last few years has resulted in problems for the Australian Archives. The first is that legislation used to privatise or corporatise the Government Enterprise has, on several occasions, had the effect that the body was no longer subject to the Archives Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second problem is that a particular legislative process used to incorporate bodies also had the effect of removing all the pre-incorporation records of the body from the operation of the Archives Act. As a result of this process, the Australian Archives has lost control of the pre-incorporation records of bodies such as the Commonwealth Bank, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the International Wool Commission and the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments concerning Government Business Enterprises are intended to prevent the inadvertent removal of records from the operation of the Archives Act as a consequence of a change in structure of certain bodies. To this end, the bill provides for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">bodies that are either established for a public purpose or subject to Commonwealth control to remain subject to the Archives Act unless specifically excluded from the operation of the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the prior records of bodies which are subsequently removed from the application of the Archives Act to also remain subject to the Act unless specifically excluded from its application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will preserve established statutory rights of access to records of national significance or public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be recognised that the bill will not prevent the transfer of Commonwealth records where the Government decides this is necessary. The amendments provide for the Government to preclude the application of the Archives Act to commercial government bodies either by means of the legislation relating to the incorporation of sale of the body or by an amendment to the regulations to the Archives Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will not apply to bodies that were excluded from the application of the Archives Act prior to the commencement of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second category of amendments concern the application of the Archives Act to the records of the National Witness Protection Program. Earlier this year the Government enacted the National Witness Protection Act 1994. This Act provides a legislative basis for a program run by the Australian Federal Police which is designed to facilitate the provision of high level witness protection, including the issuing of alternative identity documents for protected witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes special provision for access to and custody of records of the National Witness Protection Program. The bill:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">permits the Australian Federal Police to retain custody of certain sensitive documents relating to the National Witness Protection Program rather than requiring those records to be transferred to the Australian Archives;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensures that certain highly sensitive documents relating to the National Witness Protection Program are exempted from public disclosure under the Archives Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">makes specific provision for the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, or a staff member associated with the National Witness Protection Program, to provide documents and or evidence to a private hearing of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BROADCASTING SERVICES AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill 1994 seeks to amend section 115 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. Section 115 deals with subscription television broadcasting services and the protection of the free availability of certain types of television programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To obtain a full understanding of the operation of the provisions, section 115 must be read in conjunction with paragraph 10(1)(e) of Schedule 2 to the Act. Paragraph 10(1)(e) prohibits subscription television licensees from acquiring the right to broadcast a listed event unless a national broadcaster or commercial television broadcasting licensee has acquired the right to broadcast that event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subscription television services, or pay TV services as they are more commonly known, hold the promise of expanding the range of television programs available to Australian viewers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Satellite subscription television licensees have indicated that they will be broadcasting services devoted to movies, children's programming, news, documentaries, sports and music. This will reflect experience overseas. For example, in the United Kingdom, subscribers enjoy many services including news, sports, movies, travel and "lifestyle" shows, and children's programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, not everyone in Australia will want to, or may be able to afford to, subscribe to pay TV. It is for this reason that Parliament included the provisions contained in section 115 which empower the Minister to publish in the Gazette any event of a kind that, in the opinion of the Minister, should be available free to the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 31 May of this year the Minister for Communications and the Arts announced details of a list of events he had specified under section 115 of the Act in order to ensure that Australian television viewers continued to see the most popular sporting events free of charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list of events is contained in the Broadcasting Services (Events) Notice No. 1 of 1994, which was gazetted on 6 July 1994 and tabled in both Houses of Parliament on 23 August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The list consists entirely of sporting events, reflecting the Australian Broadcasting Authority's survey findings on the kinds of programs that consumers want on free-to-air television. Participating in and watching sport is, of course, a very important part of the Australian way of life. National cultural events such as ANZAC Day ceremonies do not need to be listed as there are no tradeable exclusive rights to broadcast these events. Anyone who wants to can televise them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators may recall that on 31 May the Minister also announced his intention to introduce an amendment to the Broadcasting Services Act to ensure that free-to-air broadcasters cannot "hoard" the rights they obtain through the operation of the anti-siphoning list. If a commercial or national broadcaster secures the free-to-air rights to an event on the list but does not broadcast the event, then these or other events will be able to be taken off the list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am happy to say that this amendment will honour that commitment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, let me turn to the details of this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill I present today amends the Act to make it absolutely clear that the Minister may amend a notice under subsection 115(1) for reasons other than but including those contained in the existing subsection 115(2).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3(a) of the bill corrects a drafting anomaly in the Act by removing an unnecessary reference to "live televising". The distinction between "televising" and "live televising" of events has no practical effect under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 3(b) omits the existing subsection 115(2) and substitutes two new subsections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 115(1A) enables the Minister to amend the notice under subsection 115(1) to specify additional events the televising of which should, in the opinion of the Minister, be available free to the public. There has been some recent questioning about the Minister's ability to add events to the anti-siphoning list. This provision will dispel any concerns by clarifying the Minister's power to amend a notice under subsection 115(1) to include further events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister said on 31 May, events in the Olympics and the Commonwealth Games will be placed on a "Watch List". This approach will allow particular events within future Games to be added to the list of events specified under section 115. Events that will be developed in the future may also be added under new subsection 115(1A) if appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New subsection 115(2) makes it clear that the Minister may amend a notice under subsection 115(1) to remove an event from the Notice and describes certain circumstances where the Minister may wish to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The examples of such circumstances are contained in a note under the subsection. The first example essentially corresponds to the circumstances set out in the current subsection 115(2) of the Act, where the national broadcasters and commercial licensees have had a real opportunity to acquire the right to televise an event, but none of them has acquired the right within a reasonable time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second example deals with the situation where the "hoarding" of an event occurs. This example is where a commercial television broadcasting licensee has acquired the right to televise an event, but has failed to televise it or has televised only an unreasonably small proportion of the event.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stress that the Minister's power to remove events from the anti-siphoning list is not confined to these examples. They have been inserted for illustrative purposes only. The purpose of this amendment is to deal with circumstances that we can currently envisage as well as to allow for future developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) will play a key role in advising the Minister in connection with the operation of the legislative provisions contained in the bill. The Minister is giving the ABA a general direction to monitor and report on the extent to which broadcast rights to events on the anti-siphoning list are acquired and used by free-to-air broadcasters and whether there are any grounds for the Minister to add other events to the list. The Minister is also able to specifically direct the ABA to investigate whether grounds exist for the removal of particular events from, or addition of particular events to, the list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, clause 3(c) makes a consequential amendment to subsection 115(3) to ensure that a notice published under the new subsection 115(1A) is a disallowable instrument. In other words, the Parliament will have the final discretion in regard to the addition or removal of events to or from the anti-siphoning list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, with these simple changes, we will achieve greater flexibility and certainty in the operation of the anti-siphoning laws for Australian television.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMMUNICATIONS AND THE ARTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends 6 Acts administered within the Communications and the Arts portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main amendments are those made to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing scheme. The other amendments make minor policy changes to enhance existing schemes, improve mechanisms for implementing them, and make minor drafting changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will refer in turn to each of the Acts being amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 repeals section 70 of the Act. This removes the requirement for the ABC to obtain Ministerial approval prior to entering into lease back arrangements and contracts above a set threshold (currently set by Regulation at $2,000,000).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that responsibility for entering into contracts and lease back arrangements should be a matter for the Board and management of the ABC consistent with their overall responsibility for the financial management of the ABC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Australian Film, Television and Radio School Act 1973 to make minor changes relating to the operation of the School. The amendments extend participation in the management of the School by enabling part-time staff who have been employed with the School for more than 12 months or who have a 12 month contract of employment to vote for, and stand for election for, the staff-elected position on the School's Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also reduces the number of Council members required to form a quorum at a Council meeting from 6 to 5.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadcasting Services Act 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to clarify a number of drafting anomalies and to adopt current Commonwealth practice of expressing maximum financial penalties in terms of "penalty units", in accordance with section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor technical amendments are made to certain definitions to clarify that Australian drama content requirements placed on subscription television broadcasting licences are not confined to satellite services, but apply to all subscription television broadcasting services devoted primarily to drama (as specified in section 102 of the Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also clarify that the penalty provisions and enforcement powers of the Australian Broadcasting Authority relating to breaches of the ownership and control rules also apply to subscription television broadcasting licences, as originally intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Radiocommunications Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purposes of the proposed amendments to the Radiocommunications Act 1992 are to assist the implementation of a new apparatus licensing scheme which has resulted from a public inquiry by the Spectrum Management Agency (SMA), and to make improvements in relation to various operational issues identified since the SMA commenced operations on 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Submissions to the apparatus licence inquiry conducted by the SMA generally supported a proposal to allow transfer of an apparatus licence with no change to the terms and conditions applying to the licence. The Radiocommunications Act is to be amended to allow a licensee to transfer an apparatus licence to another person. When the licence is transferred, it will remain in force for the balance of the original term of the licence. The transferred licence will also be subject to the same conditions as applied to the licence immediately before the transfer. The amendments give the SMA the power to make a disallowable determination that certain types of licences are not to be transferred, or specifying circumstances in which a licence may not be transferred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will enable the SMA to accredit persons to issue frequency assignment certificates and take into account such certificates in its licensing decisions. A frequency assignment certificate will certify that the operation of a device will not unacceptably interfere with radiocommunications. These amendments are proposed in response to representations from industry participants that the SMA should have powers to accredit persons for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act currently provides that licences, including short-term licences, may be issued only in compliance with the spectrum plan or relevant frequency band plans. This provision restricts the flexibility of the SMA to deal with major public events such as the Australian Grand Prix. An amendment is proposed to enable the SMA to issue short-term licences to deal with such events. These short-term licences will be limited to terms of 30 days and may be renewed only once.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill inserts new provisions intended to improve the scheme under Part 4.1 of the Act which requires compliance of radiocommunications equipment with standards, technical licence specifications and class licences. These new provisions reflect schemes in Europe for the monitoring of compliance with quality assurance programs in the manufacture or importation of radiocommunications devices, and will allow the SMA to publish a notice in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> requiring manufacturers or importers of devices to conduct quality assurance programs or ensure that such programs are conducted in relation to the devices they are manufacturing or importing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments extend the scheme which allows penalties to be paid by persons in lieu of prosecution under the Act. The amendments will allow for the payment of a fine in lieu of prosecution for offences relating to class licences. Such a provision applies in respect of other licence types and this amendment will correct an anomaly in the current provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains various other minor amendments to the Radiocommunications Act and these are explained in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Special Broadcasting Service Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill repeals section 67 of the Special Broadcasting Services Act 1991 to remove the requirement for the SBS to obtain Ministerial approval prior to entering into contracts above a set threshold, currently $2,000,000. The Government considers that responsibility for entering into contracts should be a matter for the Board and management of the SBS, consistent with their overall responsibility for the financial management of the SBS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Telecommunications Act 1991</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1991 to adopt current Commonwealth practice of expressing maximum financial penalties in terms of "penalty units", in accordance with section 4AA of the Crimes Act 1914.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible to make a firm estimate of the financial impact of the proposed amendments to the Radiocommunications Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed provision for the transfer of apparatus licences will involve a transfer fee which is currently proposed by the SMA to be $30 to reflect the cost of administration involved. Payment of such fees should therefore offset any direct administrative costs. There is otherwise no direct cost or revenue benefit to the Commonwealth. Transferability of licences is likely to result in a secondary market for exchange of licences. This is seen to have positive effects for the economy through facilitation of provision of services but the financial effects cannot be quantified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision to require quality assurance programs to be conducted for equipment will improve overall quality of Australian manufactured, or imported, products and will produce a source of further work for providers of quality assurance certification in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other amendments in the bill are not expected to have a significant impact on Commonwealth expenditure or revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EXPORT MARKET DEVELOPMENT GRANTS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr president, the government's May 1994 white paper, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation</EMPHASIS>, proposed a number of initiatives with respect to the development of trade. These initiatives included amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act 1974 (EMDG) related to improving the focus of the scheme relevant to the emerging industries of the 1990's, and measures to refine the direction of grants whilst containing costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill includes five amendments to the EMDG act in support of white paper initiatives, and nine `technical' amendments which clarify some existing limiting provisions, and introduce some new limiting and expansionary provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators will be aware that the government recently commissioned an evaluation of the EMDG scheme. The evaluation was supported by independent analysis carried out by the economic evaluation unit of price Waterhouse and Professor Ron Bewley, Professor of Econometrics at the University of New South Wales. That evaluation clearly demonstrated that the EMDG scheme is encouraging companies to spend additional revenue on export promotion and that the community is reaping significant rewards from EMDG through additional exports of Australian goods and services. Whilst Professor Bewley said that it is not meaningful to summarise the effectiveness of the EMDG scheme in a single multiplier, he argued that a multiplier of 15 to 25 is currently an indicative estimate for a firm from most industries that has been exporting for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition of this the government has decided to extend the scheme for a further four years beyond its current 1994/95 expiry date, to grant year 1998/99.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided also that given the potential increases in exports from the tourism sector and the contribution that promotion of `single tourism services' can make, the EMDG scheme should be extended to include single service tourism providers at a grant rate of 25 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Providers of a package of three or more prescribed tourism `amenities' have been eligible for EMDG assistance since 1990/91. The intention at that time was to extend eligibility to the inbound package providers of tourism services who achieve bulk arrivals of overseas visitors. This bill provides for the scheme to be extended to include the provision of single tourism `amenities'. Providers of individual services, such as hotel rooms, will now be eligible to claim grants for the promotion of that single service alone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The grant rate for the provision of eligible tourism services (three or more eligible amenities provided for an all inclusive price to a non Australian resident) is 50 cents in the dollar. The promotion of single services is to attract a grant rate of 25 cents in the dollar. Promotion by individual operators is interwoven with generic promotion of Australia as a tourist destination, and considerable government funding is already dedicated to this generic promotion through the Australian Tourism Commission. In addition, a substantial level of promotion is considered to result in `switching' from other service operators, tourists who are already `captive' to Australia as a destination. In the circumstances it is considered that the higher rate of grant of 50 cents in the dollar is not appropriate. The range of tourism amenities eligible for grants consideration will be the same for both single amenity and multi amenity providers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some `technical' adjustments have been necessary to allow single service providers access to the scheme. Many single service providers derive a considerable proportion of their income from an Australian inbound operator. If left without amendment to the act, these particular earnings would be ineligible for all purpose under EMDG, as the act accepts as eligible only those earnings received directly by way of a contract with a non Australian resident. However, it is recognised that many single service providers expend considerable funds promoting their amenity directly overseas. If not modified, the export performance test, in later years, could severely limit the grant payable. To minimise this disadvantage to single service providers, and at the same time prevent the double counting of earnings, this bill provides for an apportionment of these particular earnings amongst the inbound operator and the single service provider.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the changed circumstances in the Republic of South Africa, provisions restricting trade with the republic are repealed and the scheme now includes the costs of promotion to that market as eligible expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also extends the scheme to allow the costs of departure taxes and visas as a legitimate component of overseas travel, and closes a developing `loophole' with respect to the interpretation of costs eligible under the `free technical information' provisions of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Companies have been able to access EMDG without regard to their collective ability to attract funds. The grant maximum of $250,000 can be paid individually to any number of companies within a group of companies, thereby not limiting the amount of EMDG funding a company group can receive. Company groups generally have greater access to funds than individual organisations and a limit of $250,000 per company group per grant year is considered appropriate. Group companies will remain free to pursue approved joint venture and consortium without these activities being attributed to the group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of `technical' amendments made by this bill clarify the intent behind existing provisions in the act. The bill ensures that approved joint venture and consortium are subject to EMDG insolvency and convictions provisions in the same way as all other claimants under the scheme. The bill ensures that expenditure incurred in relation to `new markets' can be separated from other expenditure, and be fully eligible under the scheme, and ensures that the costs of travel undertaken on behalf of several individuals may be fully distributed across all beneficiaries to reflect the true share of costs incurred by individual claimants. The bill removes also an unintended and discriminatory benefit in relation to capital expenditure currently available to persons promoting industrial property rights and know how.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Trade Commission administers a number of financial assistance schemes to assist exporters, the majority of which may be accessed concurrently, thus reducing the beneficiary's commitment and increasing taxpayer liability. This bill limits access, on an individual project basis, to either EMDG or other commission financial assistance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons convicted of prescribed offences, within specified time frames, are not eligible to receive grants. In seeking to ascertain whether or not a person is or has been convicted of a prescribed offence, the commission must obtain the written permission of the grants applicant. If refused, the commission currently has no power to discontinue investigation of a claim and not pay a grant. This bill provides this fundamental power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons who make false or misleading statements, or produce false or misleading documents to obtain a grant must be discouraged to the fullest possible extent. The burden of proof currently on the commission is very restrictive, severely limiting the effectiveness of the provision. This bill widens the scope of the penalty provision to include situations where a person ought reasonably to have known, having regard to their abilities, experience, qualifications and other attributes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, it is important that the scheme incorporate measures to limit excessive use by any one exporter or group of exporters. The scheme incorporates a number of thresholds designed to indicate and foster commitment to export, and to provide fair, but not unlimited, assistance. It was with this latter objective in mind that the scheme introduced some years ago a limit of eight grants per claimant. The scheme incorporates also, measures to prevent endless grants being paid to continuing business activities, which would be possible, for example, were a claimant able to become a `new' claimant by simply changing its name. Interpretation of the relevant provision by reviewing authorities, however, has resulted in the intention of the provision being severely diluted. The intention of the provision is restored by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to implement some of the recommendations made in the initial report of the joint review of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 August 1993 the Attorney-General announced in the context of the 1993/94 Budget that his Department, the Department of Finance and HREOC would jointly conduct a review of the role and functions and the efficiency and effectiveness of HREOC. It was appropriate to have such a review as the workload of HREOC had broadened since its establishment in 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An initial report was finalised so that the need for legislative amendment could be considered prior to the appointment of a new Human Rights Commissioner in December 1994. A supplementary report is in preparation and will make recommendations on cooperative arrangements, complaint handling procedures and simplification and consolidation of the legislation. The review is examining the appropriate role and function of HREOC and its relationship to other bodies. Following that, it will address: </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the appropriate structure and operating arrangements for the Commission and Commissioners in the future taking into account:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission's performance of its work to date;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the performance of the Commission to date in relation to financial and resource management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial report examined and made recommendations on resource utilisation, corporate performance and the structure of HREOC. The supplementary report which is still in preparation will deal with three key interrelated issues of cooperative arrangements, complaint handling procedures and possible consolidation of the legislation into one Act including plain English drafting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial report recognised HREOC's unique role and structure and made a number of recommendations bringing into line various functions of the Commission. These have been accepted and given effect to in this bill. They are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment of the HREOC Act to specifically empower HREOC to expend its resources on the functions of the Privacy Commissioner under the Privacy Act. There was no change proposed by the initial report to the role of the Privacy Commissioner, the initial options being either to entirely remove the Privacy Commissioner from HREOC or to amend the Privacy Commissioner's role and functions to bring them fully into HREOC in line with those of the other Commissioners. Any change to the Privacy Commissioner's role was not supported by the Privacy Commissioner or the other Commissioners. Historically the different position of Privacy Commissioner arose because it grew out of the position that would have been established to administer the Australia Card. In addition, the Privacy Commission's functions, especially those relating to audit, are quite different from those of the other Commissioners.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendment of the HREOC Act, the Race Discrimination Act, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Disability Act and the Privacy Act to provide general qualifications and require appropriate knowledge or experience for the appointment to each specialised position of Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The management of HREOC, including the powers of a Secretary under the Public Service Act, is presently vested in the Human Rights Commissioner subject to the direction of the Commission. All Commissioners agreed that the present arrangement was now undesirable and should be changed. The pressures of managing an organisation of the size to which HREOC has grown led the review to consider two options for improving the structure of HREOC. The option favoured by the Commission and the Attorney-General and proposed in the initial report was to remove the management function from the Human Rights Commissioner and settle it instead upon all six Commissioners collectively. It is expected that the CEO management powers will be delegated by the Commission to an Executive Director appointed by the Commission. This provides the Commission as a whole with the opportunity properly to assume responsibility for corporate functions and should encourage the Commissioners to act in a collegiate manner. The President's position could be filled as either a part-time or full-time member of the Commission. The bill provides that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the HREOC Act be amended to vest the management function on all Commissioners as well as enabling the Attorney&mdash;General to recommend the appointment of a President on either a full-time or a part-time basis.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the HREOC Act be amended so that the Attorney-General can appoint an acting President, and to enable members attending a Commission meeting from which the President is absent to elect one of their number to preside at that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The financial impact of the proposals is comparatively small although there would be increasing costs if a full-time President were appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion let me emphasis the importance of this first step in enhancing the Commission's structure to enable the Commission to properly assume responsibility for corporate functions and to encourage Commissioners to act in a collegiate manner in the spirit of promoting the indivisibility and universality of all human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law And Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 will amend six Acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio. It will also consequentially amend a number of Acts within the responsibility of the Departments of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Industrial Relations and the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. They are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act and the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 will rationalise the arrangements for hearing reviews of adverse or qualified security assessments made under the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for review are currently heard by the Security Appeals Tribunal which has no other function. Although it is arguable that the Security Appeals Tribunal's separate status and exclusive function were justified when it was established in 1979, its work load has declined since the early 1980s and it is now averaging less than one application a year. In fact, it has received only two applications in the last five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Abolition of the Security Appeals Tribunal and transfer of its function to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will produce minor reductions in expenditure and administrative burden, in so far as it will no longer be necessary to have a separate Annual Report or separate retainers for some of its members. Moreover, the separate existence of the Security Appeals Tribunal has become increasingly theoretical as more and more of its members and staff have been drawn from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for review will be heard by a new Security Appeals Division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The legislation establishing the new Division will take account of the special nature of its work by incorporating within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act those provisions of the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act that relate to the confidentiality of proceedings and the qualifications for appointment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administrative Appeals Tribunal already has power to hear appeals against the refusal of requests under the Archives Act for access to ASIO records that are more than 30 years old. This jurisdiction will also be included in the new Security Appeals Division because it calls for skills and knowledge similar to those involved in review of security assessments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 will insert a reading-down provision additional to existing section 15A, which already provides that Acts are to be construed so as not to exceed Commonwealth powers. The new provision is intended to address difficulties which have arisen in the interpretation of statutory provisions which have a valid operation, but which can also be interpreted as going beyond the Commonwealth's legislative power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadly, the new provision will provide that if a statutory provision could be read as having a particular application which would exceed Commonwealth power, and can also be read as having a valid application, the Parliament intended that the provision should have only the valid application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 will give effect to the recommendations of the Report of the Review on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The bill will also amend the Act to provide that the Tribunal has the power to remit matters to the decision-maker for reconsideration at any stage of the proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January 1990, under the Courts And Tribunals Administration Amendment Act 1989, the President of the Tribunal became responsible for managing the administrative affairs of the Tribunal. Following this it was agreed that the operations of the Tribunal should be reviewed to assess the delivery of services by the Tribunal and the effectiveness and efficiency of the Tribunal's existing operation, administrative arrangements and structures. Similar reviews were undertaken in the Federal and Family Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Review was conducted by representatives of the Tribunal, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance between October 1990 and November 1991. The Report of the Review made some 200 recommendations for reform. Many of those recommendations related to the internal operation of the Tribunal and have been implemented by the President of the Tribunal. The review also made a number of recommendations for amendments to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975. Some changes to the Act recommended by the review were made by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Amendment Act 1993. This bill includes amendments to implement other recommendations of the Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments are directed at streamlining the procedures of the Tribunal and clarifying the power of the Tribunal in procedural matters. The amendments will enable the Tribunal to operate more flexibly and will assist the Tribunal to achieve maximum efficiency.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976. The Federal Court is able to refer proceedings, with the consent of the parties, to arbitration. Currently there is no appeal mechanism for awards made in court-referred arbitration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act to enable a party to an arbitration to seek a review, on a question of law, of an award made in arbitration. Where the arbitration is not yet complete, a party to the arbitration will be able to request the arbitrator to seek leave for a review on a question of law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will repeal section 77F(3) of the Judiciary Act 1903. This section confers a personal power on the Chief Justice to issue commissions to persons authorising them to administer oaths and affirmations for the purposes of proceedings in the High Court. The exercise of this power ceased in 1972. Section 77G enables the Court to issue such commissions so a personal power in the Chief Justice to do this is not necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the High Court Rules and the Evidence Act together allow for affidavit evidence to be taken by a broad class of persons without the need for special commissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will consequentially amend the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, the Migration Act 1958, the Estate Duty Assessment Act 1914, the Federal Proceedings (Costs) Act 1981, the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1936, the Pay-Roll Tax Assessment Act 1941, the Pay-Roll Tax (Territories) Assessment Act 1971, and the Safety, Rehabilitation And Compensation Act 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also remove gender-specific language from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL HEALTH AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the National Health Act 1953 to continue the benefits achieved in the last four years of the Agreement with community pharmacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill reflects the fact that both community pharmacy and the Government recognise the importance of the current Agreement in being able to make fundamental changes to community pharmacy and the need to continue those changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Agreement has provided the incentives and the stability to allow these necessary changes to occur in an environment of co-operation and planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Agreement has:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provided assistance to over 600 pharmacists to voluntarily accept payment to hand back their approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits. In general these pharmacies have been the smaller, less viable pharmacies which adversely impacted on the cost of supply of pharmaceutical benefits.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">encouraged pharmaceutical services to be established and maintained in isolated areas. Over 400 pharmacies in isolated areas now receive extra remuneration to assist in meeting their higher costs.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">produced a period of stability during which Government and pharmacy have not been locked in conflict over remuneration issues, a situation that has dogged past relationships.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has given both pharmacy and Government the opportunity to explore the beneficial role of pharmacy in health care for the community at a time when community health care is changing rapidly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noticeable now is the recognition by the pharmacy organisations of the need to monitor the performance of community pharmacy and to measure the outcomes of their activities in health care. In other words, pharmacy is moving from a reactive to a proactive service to the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will allow these changes to continue while building on the experiences gained from the current Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the Government and pharmacy agree that the number of approved pharmacies is now at about the correct level and that the closure and amalgamation payments should cease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ratio of pharmacies per 1000 population is now within the range of international figures unlike the higher levels previously experienced. It is now a matter to continue to encourage a good distribution of pharmacies rather than the clumping that has occurred in the past and that still exists in some areas of our capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve this distribution the current controls relating to the relocation of pharmacies are to be relaxed so that developing areas around the capital cities and other growth areas can be provided with appropriate pharmaceutical services. It is expected that these relocated pharmacies will come from the presently overserviced areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To encourage the provision of pharmaceutical services in rural and remote regions, the incentives for pharmacies to operate in isolated areas will be continued under the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will permit simpler procedures for approved pharmacists wishing to sell a business or change the ownership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In other cases the valuable work and successes of the Pharmacy Restructuring Authority will be maintained. The Authority will be reduced in membership and its name will be changed to the Australian Community Pharmacy Authority. It will continue to use the experience of hands-on pharmacists to advise the Secretary on applications for new approvals and on relocations of approvals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criteria for these considerations will, as is the case under the present Agreement, be set out in a determination made under section 99L of the National Health Act 1953.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary to be confident that pharmacists who supply pharmaceutical benefits maintain adequate standards of practice.  The bill will permit the Secretary to apply conditions for holding an approval to supply pharmaceutical benefits, primarily applying standards of practice developed by pharmacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also introduces the ability of the Minister to agree to professional allowances for specific professional pharmacy activities outside the pharmaceutical benefits supply functions. One such area is medication review of residents in nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Remuneration Tribunal, in making a determination concerning the remuneration of approved pharmacists for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits, is required to give effect to any agreement in force between the Minister and the Pharmacy Guild of Australia on this matter. This provision in the legislation is to continue in operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987, the Farm Household Support Act 1992, Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992. In addition, this bill will repeal the Livestock Diseases Act 1978.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Livestock Diseases Act 1978 is to be repealed to remove the Commonwealth's responsibility for exotic disease eradication activities in the Australian Capital Territory (A.C.T.) and remove the Commonwealth's liability for payment of compensation to A.C.T. producers whose property is destroyed or damaged as a result of exotic disease or associated eradication activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the proposed repeal of this act will allow the A.C.T. to join in the Commonwealth/ states cost sharing agreement for sharing the costs of exotic animal disease eradication campaigns on an equal basis with the states and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994 (Collection of Levy Act) is to address the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (the NRA) commencing registration activities in 1995 and not 1994 as was originally intended. The amendments will enable the Collection of Levy Act to apply for 1995/96 and thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, experience with the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Interim Levy) Act 1994 has identified the requirement for a number of minor amendments which will improve the administrative efficiency of the Collection of Levy Act and hence benefit industry. These amendments include changing the date for payment of the levy from 1 June to 31 July each year. This will remove the necessity for industry to pay both the interim levy and main levy during the 1994/95 financial year. In addition, the NRA will be able to approve levy payments by instalments, thus spreading the cost to industry over a period of time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the late penalty payment provisions will allow for those payments to be set by primary legislation, rather than prescribed by regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 provides the framework for the operations of the Australian Horticultural Corporation (AHC) and its subsidiary product board, the Australian Dried Fruits Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the AHC was established, provision was made in its enabling legislation for the chairperson to report to the annual general meeting of the eligible industry body representing a levy paying industry. In the first few years of the corporation's operation, when there were only a small number of industries participating in the corporation, this approach worked well. However, with nine industries now participating in the corporation, the chairperson of the corporation has been required to undertake a significant additional workload. This workload is likely to increase again in the short term as a number of other industries have signalled their intention to commence levy contributions to the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore proposed to amend the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 to enable other members of the corporation's board to provide the annual report of the corporation's activities to the annual general meetings of eligible industry bodies. This will reduce the burden on the chairperson while at the same time maintaining the accountability linkage between the board of directors and its levy paying constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Australian Dried Fruits Board was established, provision was made in the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 for product boards to convene an annual general meeting for the purposes of reporting on their activities to their levy paying constituents. Two such meetings have been held by the Australian Dried Fruits Board&mdash;the first in June 1993 and the second in June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following representations from the dried vine fruits industry, the government has decided to remove the need for product boards to convene an annual general meeting. The government has accepted the recommendation from the Australian Dried Fruits Association, which is the eligible industry body for dried vine fruit producers, that the chairperson of the Australian Dried Fruits Board report to the annual general meeting of the association. This will replace the need for the Australian Dried Fruits Board, and other product boards which may be established under the act, to hold an annual general meeting. This approach is consistent with the accountability arrangements for the parent body, the Australian Horticultural Corporation, which also reports to the annual general meetings of its eligible industry bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The repeal of the annual general meeting provisions of the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 will have a retrospective effect from 1 July 1994. The chairperson of the Australian Dried Fruits Board will be required to present the report of the board's 1993/94 activities to the 1995 annual general meeting of the Australian Dried Fruits Association. This arrangement has the total and unqualified support of the Australian Dried Fruits Association, the Australian Dried Fruits Board and the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation is a statutory body which was established in 1988 with the responsibility for the coordination and funding of horticultural research and development (R&amp;D). Horticultural industries which participate in the corporation contribute through statutory levies and export charges and voluntary contributions. Expenditure of industry funds on R&amp;D is matched by the Commonwealth on a dollar for dollar basis up to 0.5 per cent. of the gross value of production of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a requirement of the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 that the chairperson of the corporation report each year to the annual conference, or a meeting of the executive, of each eligible industry body representing a levy paying industry. As the number of industries now participating in the corporation has increased to eleven, the chairperson of the corporation has experienced a similar increase in workload as the chairperson of the Australian Horticultural Corporation. Accordingly, it is proposed to amend the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 to enable other members of the corporation's board to provide the annual report of the corporation's activities to the annual conference or meeting of the executive of each eligible industry body. This is consistent with the approach being proposed for the Australian Horticultural Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992, will extend farm household support to farmers who have reached the pension age. This will provide a further option for farmers who are unable to receive the aged pension, or who receive a reduced pension, because they have a relatively high level of farm assets which they are not able to realise. Access to farm household support for this group of farmers will enable them to meet basic living expenses while they arrange for the sale of their property or work to place the farm on a firmer footing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Rural Adjustment Act 1992 is being amended to allow the Rural Adjustment Scheme (RAS) to operate at a regional level. This will allow RAS to better meet the structural adjustment needs of specific regions. A regional approach to RAS would not replace the existing individual based approach, based on delivery direct to individual farmers through the state RAS authorities. Assistance will continue to individual farmers; with the two approaches to RAS operating in a complementary manner. The changes will allow the Commonwealth the flexibility of dealing directly with farmers and organisations relating to rural adjustment, and is an important step in the overall implementation of the regional approach to the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ROAD TRANSPORT REFORM (DANGEROUS GOODS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I take great pleasure in introducing the Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is part of a scheme designed to achieve the objectives of the Heads of Government Agreements on Heavy and Light Vehicles. The Agreements form schedules to the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The efficiency of Australia's road transport system has in the past been undermined by inconsistent or contradictory road regulations imposed by each of the States and Territories, and this has impeded Australia's economic development. Accordingly in January 1992 the National Road Transport Commission was established following agreement between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories to develop nationally uniform or consistent regulations relating to the construction and use of heavy vehicles. The Commission's role was subsequently greatly expanded by a second Agreement relating to light vehicles. This agreement, among other things, required the Commission as a matter of priority to develop and/or maintain national standards and associated codes of practice in relation to the transport of dangerous goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of the national scheme are to produce improvements to both road safety and transport efficiency and reductions in the cost of administration of road transport. The parties to the agreement agreed that these objectives necessitated the creation of uniform or consistent road transport legislation throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The model adopted in the agreement to put the legislative scheme in place requires the Commonwealth to submit to Parliament road transport legislation in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and Jervis Bay Territory. The States and the Northern Territory agreed to then secure the passage of adopting legislation through their respective parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation of the States and Northern Territory will also provide for the automatic adoption of future amendments to the road transport legislation and regulations. This will ensure that the legislation throughout Australia remains identical to that enacted by the Commonwealth in respect of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Parliament has previously enacted two other bills under the cooperative scheme. The first established the framework for the adoption of a national system of heavy vehicle charges. The second put in place the powers to make regulations relating to the operations of vehicles and traffic. It intended to be the basis for making a series of regulations covering issues such as vehicle standards, driver standards, hours of driving, the use of large vehicles and traffic operations. A number of sets of regulations have already been developed under that legislation and approved by the Ministerial Council for Road Transport. The Council consists of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for road transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill puts in place the framework for the establishment, administration and enforcement of uniform regulations relating to the transport of dangerous goods by road. The bill therefore forms the top tier of a legislative scheme which will incorporate proposed Road Transport Reform (Dangerous Goods) Regulations and the Australian Dangerous Goods and Explosives Codes, which presently cover the land transport of dangerous goods throughout Australia. While the Codes presently provide a common set of standards for all Australian jurisdictions, there is a lack of uniformity in the degree to and manner in which those documents are incorporated into the law of each Australian jurisdiction. This bill provides the mechanism by which that deficiency can be overcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has been developed by the Commission in close consultation with regulatory authorities responsible for administration of transport and of dangerous goods in all jurisdictions, as well as the substantial industry groupings which will be affected by this legislation. A Regulatory Impact Statement on the bill was circulated widely and submissions in response to that statement, including those from the road transport industry, have been taken into account in finalising the bill. That consultative process is continuing in the development of Regulations, as the Commission continues to maintain close links with the Advisory Committee for the Transport of Dangerous Goods. The Advisory Committee comprises representatives of the industry and regulatory authorities and in the past has been responsible for the preparation of the Codes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial Council voted in favour of the bill by a majority vote on 30 September 1994, in accordance with the procedures set out in the National Road Transport Commission Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to briefly draw Senators attention to a number of salient features of this legislation. As I said earlier, this legislation establishes a framework for the making, administration and enforcement of regulations. Part II of the Act is therefore an extensive regulation-making power. It allows regulations to be made in relation to a wide range of matters, including classification, labelling, packaging, stowage and segregation, transport of dangerous goods, mandatory accreditation of persons involved in the transport of dangerous goods and the obligations which arise in an emergency. The regulation making power allows regulations made under the Act to apply, adopt or incorporate the provisions of a Code or Standard. This is an important provision as the Codes set out the detailed technical standards which the regulations apply, and it is essential that the regulatory regime keep pace with technical developments at an international level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part III of the bill provides for the appointment and powers of Competent Authorities and authorised officers. The powers of authorised officers broadly reflect the powers which are available to authorised officers in each of the jurisdictions under present State and Territory dangerous goods legislation. While there are differences between the body of powers in the Act and those in each of the jurisdictions, the Commission believes, on the basis of extensive consultation with industry and the relevant authorities, that the body of powers is both comprehensive and sufficient to allow for effective administration of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part IV of the bill allows Competent Authorities to grant exemptions to persons or classes of persons from requirements in the regulations and the Codes. This will enable the present practice to continue whereby Competent Authorities responsible for the administration of the transport of dangerous goods can allow a person to operate at variance from the Codes. This brings to the legislation a measure of flexibility which is necessary to reflect the different requirements which may arise from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and the changing technical requirements relating to dangerous goods transport.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part V of the bill creates a number of serious offences in relation to dangerous goods. While offences in regulations will be able to provide penalties up to $3,000 for natural persons and $15,000 for corporations, the general offences in the Act relate to breaches of duties which have potential to undermine public safety. They therefore reflect the serious safety considerations which are at the heart of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part VI of the bill provides for a range of further orders to be made against persons responsible for breaches of the regulations and provides a comprehensive set of powers and sanctions which can be called upon in the event of non-compliance. In particular, clause 42 of the bill allows for corporations and their directors and senior managers to be held responsible for breaches committed by individuals in their employ or acting on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A feature of the present regulatory framework, centred as it is on the requirements of the Dangerous Goods and Explosives Code, is that there is a common set of requirements applying to both road and rail transport of dangerous goods. The Commonwealth recognises the concern which has been expressed by rail authorities and rail operators that creation of a uniform system for the transport of dangerous goods by road should not come at the expense of the intermodal harmony which presently exists between road and rail. My Department has given a commitment to ensure that the provisions of the present Codes relating to rail are revised in harmony with the road provisions so that the essential seamlessness between the two modes is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implementation of uniform or consistent regulations in relation to road transport of dangerous goods is regarded as an integral element in achieving reforms in the road transport industry which will promote consistency, safety and efficiency. The government therefore supports the efforts of the National Road Transport Commission in its development of a truly national approach. It will result in a single nationally consistent and durable set of regulations covering road transport of dangerous goods, which is consistent with the other regulations relating to road transport generally being developed by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and Territory governments must also demonstrate their commitment to the reform process to ensure that its objectives are achieved and to enable the road transport industry to reap the benefits of those reforms as early as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this bill have no significant impact on Commonwealth revenues or expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TELECOMMUNICATIONS (INTERCEPTION) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Telecommunications interception is an intrusive act. It is not as intrusive as other surveillance methods, such as personal surveillance and questioning of members of the public, but it is nevertheless a major infringement of a person's privacy. This Government is very concerned to ensure that the balance between privacy and law enforcement and national security needs is an appropriate one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also concerned that interception be a cost effective investigative tool. Because of the complexity of and changes in telecommunications technology, the capacity to intercept has become more and more expensive. The Government wanted to find a balance between the needs of law enforcement and security agencies, individual rights and the cost to the public purse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end, in July 1993 the Government asked Mr Pat Barrett, a Deputy Secretary in the Department of Finance, to conduct a review of the long term cost effectiveness of telecommunications interception. His terms of reference required him to evaluate the long term cost effectiveness of maintaining Australia's current telecommunications interception capability in the light of rapid changes in complex telecommunications technology, the introduction of new telecommunications services and the continuing need to safeguard individual privacy. Mr Barrett reported in March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence suggests that telecommunications interception is very effective as part of an integrated framework of surveillance by both law enforcement and security agencies. Up to now it has been a highly cost effective investigative technique, particularly in a complementary role to other methodologies. Mr Barrett concluded that, in the short to medium term, the effectiveness of our law enforcement and security agencies and Australia's international credibility in these areas will continue to be dependent on telecommunications interception. In the longer term, the situation will depend very much on international developments. The Government accepts that Australia should continue to support efforts to develop international user requirements. Mr Barrett made recommendations aimed at achieving a continuing cost effective interception capability, which are being implemented by this bill or administratively, as appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the long term cost effectiveness of telecommunications, Mr Barrett has recommended a further review in 1997, after full deregulation of the telecommunications market. The Government has accepted that recommendation. A review in 1997 will be able to evaluate the outcomes of Mr Barrett's review as well as assessing the prospects for maintaining interception capabilities against the background of further deregulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Barrett concluded that `the significant and demonstrable justification' required for such a major intrusion on an individual's privacy as interception of telecommunications is well demonstrated by the extensive range of successful prosecutions and convictions based largely on evidence obtained by interception. He was satisfied that the administrative processes of both the law enforcement and security agencies and the carriers meet the requirements of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. He also concluded that the current system is reasonably effective in recognising and protecting the rights of all parties. He did, however, make recommendations which would contribute to greater transparency and discipline through fuller reporting and enhanced inspection processes. The Government is implementing the majority of those recommendations in the current bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a new special register with details of warrants which do not lead, directly or indirectly, to a prosecution. The amendments also create a new civil right of action against a person who unlawfully intercepts or publishes a telephone communication. These, together with the new prohibition on the disclosure of designated warrant information, represent major new privacy protections, adding to the already stringent controls in the Telecommunications (Interception) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, agencies will be required to provide more detailed information, to be included in the annual reports to the Parliament under the Act, about the usefulness and the effectiveness of warrants, including use of information obtained under a warrant in criminal proceedings and cost effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offences which may found an interception warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act will be extended to include those more serious offences involving corruption (including police corruption) or organised crime which are not at present covered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Barrett also made other recommendations which are to be implemented administratively, such as monitoring of international developments in encryption, more frequent inspection of agency records in secure premises and an increased role for AUSTEL in the coordination of interception matters. A recommendation concerning warrants for the supply of `call data', that is, electronically generated information about telephone traffic falling outside the current scope of the Act, is the subject of discussions with the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government did not accept two of Mr Barrett's recommendations. The inspection and reporting function of the Ombudsman under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act will not be transferred to the Privacy Commissioner. The present arrangements work well, are well understood by agencies and are in line with those applicable in the States. The inspection function is one which is directed towards compliance rather than adjudication of privacy issues. It is therefore better suited to the Ombudsman's functional responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government also did not accept the necessity to notify any innocent person whose telephone service has been intercepted of the fact of the interception. The new special register will provide a similar level of protection against misuse without the adverse consequences of possible disclosure of sensitive operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to tighten up the exception to the prohibition on interception by a carrier employee in the course of his or her duties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January this year the Minister for Communications and the Arts asked the Attorney-General to review the Act to determine whether amendments were necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees to intercept telecommunications in the course of their duties in maintaining the telecommunications network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This was in response to certain allegations by a group of persons known as the `Casualties of Telecom' about monitoring and recording of customer telephone services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review of the exemption, conducted by the Attorney-General's Department, concluded that the exception is very broad and that there are good grounds for narrowing it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment is only one element of a combination of measures which will address the problems that have arisen in the area of customer privacy in telecommunications. The development of more effective policies and procedures by the carriers, in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman, will support the proposed changes. These policies and procedures will serve to protect consumer privacy and will provide employees with guidance as to the circumstances where monitoring of services can take place, and the procedures that are to govern those activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In determining whether an interception was reasonably necessary, a court is to have regard to matters which are specified in regulations. Such matters may include matters contained in guidelines or similar directions issued internally by a carrier or by an independent body such as AUSTEL or the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have no direct financial impact. In the past the Commonwealth has borne the cost of providing an interception capability. The Telecommunications Act amendments will require telecommunications carriers to pay the initial cost of developing interception capabilities in new telecommunications services and recover those costs from Commonwealth and State user agencies. This cost recovery will be as negotiated between intercepting agencies and the carriers, but will be on a fair commercial basis. Actual spending proposals will be subject to the approval of the Attorney-General, the Minister for Communications and the Arts and the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am pleased to present this bill which will clarify the operation and the scope of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and will address some unintended consequences of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you are aware the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 received Royal Assent on 24 December 1992 and took effect from July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of you were party to the passing of that legislation and will recall the Act's objective:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"to improve public health in this country by limiting the exposure of the Australian public to messages and images that may persuade them to start smoking or to continue smoking or to use or continue using tobacco products".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To this end the Act bans most remaining forms of tobacco advertising subject to a few limited exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the bill was considered by the House of Representatives, the Hon S.P. Martin, then Member for MacArthur, stated in the Second Reading Speech that "like powerful drugs, firearms and other legal, although dangerous, products, advertising of tobacco products should be severely limited".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need for a ban on tobacco advertising has not waned over the 24 months since that bill was passed at Christmas-time in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, we know even more about the harms caused by tobacco consumption now than we did then, as evidenced through a number of Australian and International reports including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Peto R. and Lopez.A, et al, Mortality from Smoking in Developed Countries 1959-2000, 1994;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Drug Strategy, 1993 National Drug Household Survey,1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an Australian perspective:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">tobacco is THE major cause of preventable death and disease in Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">tobacco consumption was responsible for nearly 19 000 deaths in Australia the year we passed this legislation, and has been responsible for a further 19 000 every year since;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">tobacco consumption costs our country approximately $9.24 billion each year in terms of health, social and economic costs;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">tobacco consumption causes cardiovascular disease&mdash;this country's biggest health problem&mdash;and is the largest cause of cancer mortality in Australian males.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With one substance imposing such a significant burden on the Australian community it is not surprising that all Australian governments support the National Health Policy on Tobacco.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The pervasive nature of tobacco use in our society, its continuing appeal to a wide range of people and the available evidence on the health, social and economic costs of tobacco means that Parliament has a responsibility to take steps towards reducing tobacco consumption. Therefore, the problems associated with tobacco usage are addressed at a number of levels using many approaches, all of which together are essential to the success of the overall tobacco control strategy. The Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 is an integral component of overall tobacco control strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendments before this House is to address a number of issues that have arisen during implementation of the legislation and by so doing, clarify the operation of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, during implementation of the legislation and following consultation with key tobacco and health groups it has come to our attention that the Act may be interpreted to have a number of unintended consequences and unforeseen deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, the Commodore Car could technically be interpreted to be a tobacco advertisement as it coincidentally bears the same name as a brand of cigarettes. Clearly this is an unintended consequence of the Act that the proposed amendments will rectify.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the High Court has recently had occasion to give further consideration to the issue of an implied freedom of communication in respect of government and political matters under the Constitution, an issue which had not been fully explored before the introduction of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the High Court's decisions, a thorough review of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 has been undertaken. In this context, it has been proposed that a number of amendments be introduced to clarify the operation of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 and to identify the exact bounds of the legislation in terms of the implied freedom. As an example, the Act is not intended to stifle public debate on the question whether a legislative ban on tobacco advertising is itself appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the opportunity has also been taken to make technical and drafting amendments to facilitate the implementation of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 3) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill contains a number of minor policy changes to Veterans' Affairs Legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most significant change is an amendment to the statutory trust provisions for Anzac Hostel which are set out in Part VI of the Social Security and Repatriation Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1984. The Anzac Hostel, which is located in Brighton Victoria, is held by the Repatriation Commission on trust for the provision of serviced accommodation for Totally &amp; Permanently Incapacitated veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The terms of the trust place conditions on the manner and circumstances under which the Repatriation Commission may dispose of the Hostel. These conditions place severe restrictions on the options available for the continued provision of aged care facilities for veterans.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments proposed by this bill would remove the trust and vest the legal and beneficial ownership of the property in the Repatriation Commission. The intention is to ensure preservation of the heritage value of this historically important building and to facilitate ex-service men and women's continued use of the site as an aged care complex. To do this requires the Commission to be able to retain or dispose of the property. In consultation with ex-service organisations and health groups, the Repatriation Commission will consider several options for the continued use of Anzac Hostel as an aged care facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains five other minor amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is the insertion of a new provision which will allow the Secretary to request information from a service pensioner, income support supplement recipient or a claimant for these pensions. The new provision will also allow the Secretary to request a pensioner or claimant to appear in person to provide an officer of the Department with information which is relevant to the payment of pension or income support supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The request for such information is currently authorised under section 128 of the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. However, this section specifies only criminal penalties, that is, fines of up to $2,000 or imprisonment for up to twelve months or both, for failure to comply with a notice issued under section 128.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provision in section 54AA will duplicate the provisions in section 128 which allow the Secretary to obtain information in these situations. However, instead of imposing the harsher criminal penalties for failure to comply with such a request, the new provision will allow the Repatriation Commission to cancel or suspend pension under section 56EA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment will ensure that the action to be taken in the event of a failure of a person to comply with a request for information issued pursuant to new section 54AA will be the same as that which currently applies to service pensioners who are obliged to comply with notices issued under sections 54 and 54A of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment is a minor change to the tax file number provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The amendment will ensure that the "voluntary quotation" principle, which has always formed part of the tax file number scheme, is maintained by making it clear that the Secretary may request, but not compel, a person to provide his or her tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will also change the provisions in respect of a person who does not have a tax file number. The change will mean that, if a person who is a claimant or is eligible for a pension or allowance does not have a tax file number, the Secretary will have the power to request that person to apply to the Commissioner of Taxation to obtain a tax file number and to give the Secretary a written statement of the person's tax file number after the Commissioner has issued it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change follows a similar recent amendment to the Social Security Act and will ensure consistency in the administration of the tax file number provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third amendment relates to the information that the Department of Veterans' Affairs provides to the courts on the amounts of pension, benefit or allowance paid to a person. The Veterans' Entitlements Act does not currently make any specific provision for information provided to a person about the amount of pension benefit or allowance paid on a certain date, to be accepted by a court as prima facie evidence. This entails the preparation of a detailed statement of the payments made for each fortnight before it can be accepted as prima facie evidence by a court. Preparation of such statements are time consuming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes an amendment which would provide that a signed official Departmental document is prima facie evidence of the facts or statements contained in the document. The amendment follows similar changes to the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fourth amendment inserts the cessation date for Cambodia as an operational area. For the purposes of the Veterans' Entitlements Act, Cambodia is designated as an area of `operational service' from 20 October 1991. The Department of Defence has advised that operational service in Cambodia ceased on 7 October 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fifth and final amendment relates to two minor and technical amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act. The first of these amends the section numbers for four sections. The second removes the reference to the `Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940' in section 188A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The measures in this bill have no financial impact. However, if and when the Repatriation Commission disposes of Anzac Hostel, there may be significant savings in running costs. Any savings involved in the disposal of Anzac Hostel would depend on the manner in which it is disposed and the costs of site restoration and redevelopment as an aged care facility. I must emphasise, however, that this bill does not set out a method of disposal for the Anzac Hostel but merely gives the power to the Repatriation Commission to dispose of it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>

I had moved the amendments, and there had been an indication from the government that it had a problem with a few of the words in the amendments. Wanting to be helpful, I invited the government to suggest the wording which would be acceptable to it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the government had never agreed to a set of words. My advice is that the emphasis for the youth training allowance is on helping young people to become financially self-supporting through paid employment so that the expectation is that, on becoming unemployed, a person will initially seek paid employment. If a person were undertaking full-time voluntary work instead, as the amendment proposes, they would reduce their capacity to undertake jobsearch. Accordingly, the allowance will be paid while a person undertakes voluntary work only after the person has tested the labour market for a reasonable period, which is set at three months.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reiterate the points made in that debate, the government considers that the legislation already contains adequate safeguards. The relevant provision, section 80(1), applies only if the young person is acting unreasonably in refusing to enter an activity agreement. Further, the legislation requires that activity agreements are to take into account the clients' `education, experience, skills, age and physical condition'; I refer honourable senators to section 80(4)(a). It also should be noted that the provision under consideration is an interim provision pending passage of the Employment Services Bill. Once the Employment Services Bill is in force, activity agreements entered into under the youth training allowance legislation will be replaced by activity agreements entered into under the Employment Services Act, which is in the transitional provisions bill, schedule 3, clause 24, page 99. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments expand the time allowed for self-employment or group cooperative enterprises to be commercially viable for 12 months to 24 months for people in the deeply disadvantaged categories in the labour market. This is because the 12 months in which the person is meant to be commercially viable is impossible. People are in training activity leading to self-employment in that area that is up to 12 months long. That means, if we work our arithmetic, they actually have no time left to make their business viable. The extra 12 months meets the recommendation of ACOSS, which recommends 24 months of a protracted work plan to get the person ready for self-employment or group cooperative enterprise. The extra time allows them a chance to implement their business plans in a reasonable amount of time. </PARA>

It does not really matter in time. The real measurements are something else. The measurements are the capacity of the person, the nature of the business plan and the proposition and the capacity of the enterprise to be sustainable and to continue in a viable fashion. Such judgments are not necessarily related to time.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nevertheless, questions were asked about their viability during that period&mdash;sometimes unfashionable questions asked about the viability of some of the enterprises of the mid-1980s. Eventually they proved to be non-viable; in fact, disastrous. Time had nothing to do with that. It was the very speculative nature of the business itself. So time is not necessarily a good measurement of the viability of a business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if we are to have a time period then it ought to be flexible and long enough. I agree with Senator Margetts's description that people with disadvantages and disabilities may need time to be involved in learning how to operate a business and how to make themselves employable by themselves. Because of their very disability and disadvantage, the first 12 months could well be spent in learning those lessons, leaving no time to demonstrate the viability of the enterprise. So we believe that a longer time is more desirable if we are to have a time. So for that reason we will support the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Be patient. The government has noted the consistent position of the opposition parties with regard to extending the qualifying period of the independent criteria from 18 weeks to 26 weeks. The government has explained that it has increased benefits by the establishment of an away from home rate. The opposition has indicated that it does not accept this view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a spirit of compromise, the government therefore decided, albeit reluctantly, to present an amendment which would retain the 18-week criteria for unsupported young people participating in the work force. The government does not support the opposition's view that 13 weeks registration with the CES within an 18-week period should qualify a person as being independent, given that an away from home rate is also available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is taking a responsible position on this issue, because including the 13 weeks registration means that young people would merely have to leave home for 18 weeks, irrespective of whether they were supported by their parents, to become independent. This may encourage more young people to leave home in order to qualify. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns already exist within the community that the existing jobsearch allowance encourages young people to leave home and causes family breakdown. Since the current JSA independence criteria was introduced in 1992, the proportion of 15- to 17-year-old recipients of the independent rate increased from six per cent to nine per cent of all 15- to 17-year-old JSA recipients. The new away from home rate will assist those young people who legitimately need to live away from home to undertake training or search for a job. This rate is subject to the parental means test. However, the minimum payment of $62.90 per fortnight is also available. The away from home rate is subject only to standard waiting periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendment does not require young people to be unsupported during the 18-week period to be entitled to claim the independent rate after 18 weeks away from home. They would only have to establish that they were unsupported from 18 weeks onwards. This creates a situation where a young person may claim the away from home rate to support themselves during the 18-week qualification period and can then transfer to the independent rate thereafter. In addition, young people who are homeless will receive the independent rate and will not have to serve a waiting period. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make a few explanatory comments about our requested amendment. Firstly, about a week ago I did request some costings from the department on the implementation of this amendment. Although a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then, we have had no indication whatever of any costings. As I tend to take a rational economic view of life, I would have been extremely interested to see some of those costings in order to see what they were talking about. But absolutely nothing has been produced. So I am still in the dark totally as to what this will cost.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as we indicated at the non-existent briefings that took place, we also established that it was a relatively small number of people who would be affected by this. As I will indicate in my ensuing remarks, the fact is that it is a small number of children, which is what they are, in this age group who will be affected. But if the government goes ahead with its proposals, the proposals still have the capacity to inflict a fair degree of misery, I feel, if it is not taken back to the 18 weeks with the other proposals that we talk about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For eligibility under the jobsearch allowance, persons were required to live out of the family home for at least 18 weeks and to have been employed for at least 20 hours a week for 13 of those weeks or to have been registered as unemployed with the Commonwealth Employment Service. In the light of the government's new proposals, I would like to refresh the memory of the government as to whom the independent rate is supposed to be assisting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independent rate is for young people who, for whatever reason, feel that they can no longer live in the family home. These people may not have experienced sexual or severe physical abuse and there may not have been severe family breakdown. However, there is a compelling reason that makes the young person feel that it is no longer possible to live at home. They make a decision to leave home, they know that they will have to live away for 4 1/2 months&mdash;18 weeks&mdash;at least before they will receive any form of Commonwealth financial assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind parliament that it is a condition of the independent rate that during this four months they receive no financial or non-financial support from their parents. If they cannot get a job, they will be without any income whatsoever during this time. Yet they still feel so strongly that they cannot live at home that they are prepared to put up with this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now proposing to raise the waiting time to 26 weeks, and I accept what it said in some of its amendments. It is six months that a young person is supposed to survive without any form of income. Apparently forgetting the atrocious unemployment rate that the government has created in Australia, it is proposing that if that person is not in paid employment for at least half of that time, then they will be ineligible for the allowance. If the person is one of the hundreds of thousands of unemployed at risk of becoming long-term unemployed, then they will not qualify for this unemployment benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past the coalition has been outspoken about the need not to create an artificial incentive for young people to leave home. We were very critical of the situation with the youth homeless allowance earlier this year when many parents expressed their concern that the payment was inducing their children to move out. We still are concerned about this. We strongly believe that young people should be encouraged to remain in the family home and that there should be no artificial inducement to leave home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been claiming that the new away from home allowance is in place of, or will alleviate, any disadvantages of the stricter requirements. This is totally false and misleading. Firstly, the away from home allowance will be available only to those persons who are required to move away from home to participate in a stipulated training program. It would be extremely unlikely that any person living in a capital city or major regional centre would be eligible for this allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, those persons who are eligible are subject to a parental means and assets test as strict as that currently applying to Austudy. This has two consequences. Students from rural areas, who are those most likely to qualify for the allowance, if they live on a farm will be beset by the same problems currently facing rural students attempting to get  Austudy. They will generally be disqualified on the basis of the asset value of their farm, regardless of whether or not the farm has been producing an income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, eligible students who have to live away from home will be receiving a reduced allowance on the basis of their parents' income and assets regardless of whether or not their parents actually provide them with financial support. Another factor that I would like to present for the committee's attention is that the age range of the people affected by this problem is in the 15- to 17-year age group. We are looking at people who are 15, 16 or 17. They are not going to stay on this allowance forever. It is a comparatively short time that they will be affected and that the government will be paying out for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For heaven's sake, it is about time we looked at the real situation of these people and looked at what they have to contend with. When they are 18, they move on to something else. It is not a long-term problem. The proposed change in the independent rate eligibility by the government, even given the fact that it has conceded, I believe, that 18 weeks is fairer, is unnecessary, unfair and will, the coalition believes, further disadvantage an already disadvantaged group of young people who have suffered greatly as a direct result of Labor policies. Therefore, I commend the coalition amendment to the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we heard from Senator Troeth was a sensible explanation of the reasons for moving the amendment. Before you took the chair, Mr Temporary Chairman, Senator Margetts and I had indicated our ascending deference to a better amendment, starting with one amendment, moving to another and finally arriving at that point. We were able to see the sense of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a meeting which has been described as a non-existent briefing or at least non-resolving, we heard the reasons that the minister restated. Again before you took the chair, I had difficulty in restraining myself from insisting that the minister give reasons as to why the government would not be supporting this properly sensible amendment. We did not get in the meeting which we held with departmental staff a reason which was superior to those advanced by Senator Troeth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was amazed to hear a restatement of the excuses that have been given for arriving at the government proposal, a proposal which does not recognise that the living away from home benefit and the independent benefit will be received by two different sets of people. The benefit which accrues to one will not necessarily pass along to the other. But the government has a view that there is a sort of conveyor belt, that a person starts off on the away from home allowance, trundles along and arrives at a prize of independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Troeth has described the real world, one benefit will accrue to people who are engaged in one sort of activity and the other benefit will eventually, after a great struggle, arrive for another group of people not engaged in the same thing. The away from home allowance will most likely benefit young people from rural areas. It is unlikely that young people from capital cities will be able to justify living away from home on the basis of needing to live in a certain place to attend a certain course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The independent rate will arrive after a demonstrated period of independence. I will illustrate the ridiculousness of the tests for independence. Under the definition of not having received financial or non-financial support from parents for six months, I do not think I would be independent. Over 40 years, I cannot demonstrate that I have had a period of time longer than six months without having received some support. It would now come from my in-laws; my parents are both dead. It was only a couple of weeks ago that my mother-in-law arrived with a cake and a bucket of vegetables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us be sensible about this. How many young people who are independent, establishing their own home and living away from their parents can honestly say that they have had no support whatsoever for six months? What sort of society would we be living in if that sort of thing happened? Of course that is how the real world works&mdash;parents visit their children and continue to support them well into adulthood. In my case, I am pleased to say that the relationship I had with both my parents and which continues with my in-laws is one of a close family where I would not like to say that I was so independent that I had not received some sort of support in my endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be taken to the extreme by saying that child care by grandmothers for young people is some sort of non-financial support. It is ridiculous to put this sort of thing in legislation, and it is ridiculous to ignore what happens when people move out of home for the first time to establish their own premises and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the reality. I think Senator Troeth is quite right to say that these measures are not suitable. The government is insisting that its view of the world is right&mdash;and I say it is the departmental advisers' view of the world, rather than the philosophical view which the government has taken. I have read a couple of quotes of what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sees as the government's role in supporting young people in these endeavours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this legislation reflects the opinion that the Prime Minister expressed. It reflects a bureaucratic version of the world; it does not reflect the enlightened view that the Prime Minister proposed in his speeches announcing the youth training initiative. If the government wants people to applaud what the Prime Minister has announced&mdash;and it sounds good&mdash;it needs to recognise that this improvement proposed by Senator Troeth brings about what the Prime Minister was talking about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment further. The government, in a spirit of compromise, offered to reduce the period from 26 weeks to 18 weeks. That was in our first amendment, which the opposition voted against and we were defeated on. We were a little surprised at the opposition's position on that; nevertheless, that was defeated, but we did offer it as a compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth has asserted that the away rate is available only if a young person has to live away from home to undertake training. That is not correct. The away from home rate is also available for jobsearch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth has made some assertions about not being contacted about the costings. I am advised that an officer of the department attempted to arrange meetings with Senator Troeth or with her staff, and also with Dr Kemp. We have the costings available. This will cost the government an estimated $3.8 million over the next four years. I do not want to get into an argument about who said what to whom or meetings that did not take place or should have taken place. All I can say is that, in good faith, we wanted to pass those figures on to Senator Troeth. I do not know why that did not occur, but the officers believe they acted in good faith in attempting that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth says she is an economic rationalist. I am still waiting for the economic rationalist's explanation as to how we are supposed to reduce the budget deficit when the Senate keeps increasing expenditure and the opposition, in particular, keeps saying that it is not going to agree to any tax increases. It is a fascinating position to be in. I hope that at the next election the electorate wreaks the appropriate revenge on the opposition's amazing position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not accept the comment by Senator Bell that this issue primarily affects young rural people and not young urban people. We think it is nonsense that Senator Bell can differentiate in that way. There is no evidence that people who live in urban areas will not apply in the same way that people in rural areas would. I conclude by reading a case of a young person who is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sixteen and fed up with living with her parents because of the strict rules they try and enforce. She applies for the away from home rate of YTA so that she could leave home and stay with friends several suburbs away but is not eligible as employment prospects are not improved by moving. She is told that she can qualify for the independent rate once she has been out of home for 18 weeks so she decides to leave anyway and try to survive on her own, on the minimum payment of $62.90 per fortnight.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to illustrate to the parliamentary secretary how I reached this position without surveys and the benefit of charts and diagrams from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Drawing from what I know about young people and employment prospects, it seems to me to be fairly self-evident that, if the government has legislation&mdash;which we have been unable to amend&mdash;stating that it is reasonable to ask people to commute for 90 minutes to attend training courses and to engage in job compacts, it would follow that the away from home rate would not be available to anybody who is within 90 minutes of a training course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would also follow that if the main eligibility factor for the away from home rate was having to leave home to attend a course, it would not be easy for a metropolitan student to qualify. A metropolitan person applying for this rate would be able to find a training course for just about anything in 90 minutes of commuting within a major metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not the case for rural people. People living in our country towns would most likely be able to demonstrate the need to move away from home to attend a training course and therefore claim the away from home rate. Surely the parliamentary secretary understands that there are young people in Devonport who would want to go to Hobart to participate in particular training courses&mdash;he spends a considerable amount of his time there&mdash;and that other parts of Australia would immediately leap to his mind as being rural places where people would need to leave home to attend the training courses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the other debates we have had, none of the information that has been given here convinces me that we are doing the wrong thing by proposing that people who are independent&mdash;who are not living with their parents&mdash;should be able to qualify for the away from home rate after 18 weeks of independent living and receive recognition for that status at that time. I do not believe that the case study read to us proved one thing or another. It said that, like many 16-year-olds, a certain girl wanted to leave home and qualify for the away from home rate. She was denied that for the very thing I have just described. Yet she persisted, wanting to be independent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether someone in that situation would be successful is another matter. But it does not alter or change our position that 18 weeks is a more appropriate demonstration of independent living than 26 weeks. Quite rightly, whoever was involved in that case study determined that the person was not eligible for the away from home rate. This proves my first point, that this measure is not a conveyer belt; it is not an easy way of qualifying for the independent rate. The case study the parliamentary secretary read demonstrates what I have been saying. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scrutiny of this bill gave rise to some serious concerns on this side of parliament which have already been reflected on by two of my colleagues in the other place, Dr Michael Wooldridge, the shadow minister for community services, and Mr Philip Ruddock, the shadow minister for social security. We condemn the Labor government for: weakening the bill; failing to specify any structures for accountable and measured outcomes; neglecting the importance of long-term, secure and affordable housing; and failing to develop appropriate services in rural and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SAAP bill we are debating provides an additional $18.8 million over four years to significantly reform the way in which assistance is provided to people who are homeless or at risk of being homeless. In 1994-95, excluding this additional assistance, SAAP's total allocation is $185 million, of which $105 million will come from the Commonwealth. The break-up of the additional assistance in this bill is: for 1994-95, $3.9 million; for 1995-96, $4.8 million; for 1996-97, $4.9 million; and for 1997-98, $5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislative framework of SAAP mark III was based on the government document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SAAP: Strategic Directions</EMPHASIS>, which reflects the strategies and objectives of the senior officials group. It was largely bureaucratically driven with little or no consultation within the community. The bill redefines the terms `people who are homeless' and `homeless' for the purposes of this program; restates the purposes and objectives of the supported accommodation assistance program and the services expected of service providers; and specifies the key matters to be included in SAAP agreements between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key matters listed in clause 8 include: implementing case management; developing assessment and referral mechanisms for SAAP clients; introducing early intervention and outreach; enhancing the skills of service provider staff; strengthening links between service sectors; program management; allowing for the protection of client rights; measuring outcomes; and reporting and accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill establishes the Commonwealth Advisory Committee on Homelessness, CACH, the members of which will have expertise and understanding of the principal issues effecting homelessness. The Commonwealth advisory committee will advise the minister on matters referred to it by the minister. The other major provision of the bill is the establishment of a national SAAP coordination and development committee&mdash;known at the moment as the senior officers group&mdash;as a condition of the new SAAP agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this not starting to look as though the government is using this bill to subtly assume control over the direction of SAAP? Perhaps more importantly we should be asking whether it is using this bill to expand the scope so widely that service providers will be providing many services at less than optimum efficiency rather than delivering more tightly focused assistance with the greatest possible benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Senate estimates hearings on 15 November, officers of the Department of Housing and Regional Development, in answer to my questions concerning the allocation of additional SAAP funding, revealed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of the money will go to expand the number of existing services. All of the money will go to improving service delivery. Some of that money will be expended on salaries in services, other monies will be expended on improving data collection processes and on a range of best practice service which we may be setting up.</PARA>
<PARA>There is also no commitment from the Commonwealth or the states to incorporate growth funds into any agreements for SAAP mark III. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble to a bill, if one is included at all, is supposed to set out simply the broad intentions of the bill as a guide to subsequent interpretation of the main body of the act. The preamble to this bill attempts to give to a statement of policy the standing of a declaration of law. It makes a statement about empowering homeless people to maximise their independence. It cites certain international agreements and treaties as mandating this legislation. We on this side of the chamber have grave concerns about the way this government is making international treaties and agreements central to its social policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech, the minister, Mr Howe, alluded, albeit briefly, to the 1995 United Nations International Year of Tolerance. I understand that the government intends to undertake an awareness campaign to increase the community's understanding of homelessness. This national community education program will be funded from the 1994-95 additional allocation. The additional allocation of funds will go to three areas: improving data collection; implementing case management; and a national awareness campaign on homelessness in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech today I urge the Senate to condemn the government for: weakening the strength of the bill; failing to specific any structures for accountable and measured outcomes; neglecting the importance of affordable housing options; and failing to ensure the development of appropriate services in rural and remote communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody knows exactly how many homeless people there are in Australia today, but it is obvious that there are too many people in dire and desperate straits. A recent report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare found: every night, approximately 11,500 people seek accommodation in shelters and refuges; only 17 per cent of families and sole parents requesting assistance are able to find accommodation; one in three homeless people seeking government assisted accommodation is fleeing domestic violence; and only 23 per cent of requests by young homeless people are successfully met. What damning evidence!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department of housing, which commissioned the report as part of its evaluation of SAAP, played down the significance of these findings, saying that it was `very sceptical' about the figures and questioning the validity of the data. The bill does nothing to address those disgraceful statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also mentioned that by far the greater proportion of service provision is concentrated in major centres of population. This would imply an underservicing of regional and rural areas, particularly if people from these areas are drifting to the cities to find support. Most studies report that the incidence of homelessness will worsen over the coming decade. So, unfortunately, homelessness will increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all people who become homeless gain access to crisis accommodation. The National Inquiry into the Human Rights of People with Mental Illness reported that Aboriginal people, young people, and women with children who have a mental illness, and those with dual or multiple disabilities, are particularly disadvantaged in accessing crisis accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual level of unmet demand for women escaping domestic violence and sexual abuse is difficult to assess because shortages in medium-term supported accommodation place added strain on short-term services. Women's refuges are designed to meet short-term needs only and were not intended to provide for the needs of women and children whose unmet need for a longer term alternative results in the disruptive practice of refuge hopping. Service gaps in crisis accommodation have also been identified in rural locations, including regional centres, mining and company towns, and services catering to the needs of older women escaping domestic violence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at youth, there are literally thousands of young people who no longer live in their original home. There are many reasons for that&mdash;family violence, severe economic hardship, lack of parental support, drug and alcohol addiction within families, to name a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the numbers are increasing. Insecure and low incomes, an extremely depressed youth labour market, and lack of affordable and appropriate youth housing are problems which confront youth today in their search for independence. The supported accommodation assistance program or SAAP has been a positive program since its development. The supported accommodation assistance program is a jointly funded Commonwealth-state program which was established in 1984 in response to the needs of homeless people or those in crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP has evolved over a period of nine years. Its transition from SAAP Mark 1 through to SAAP Mark III has occurred to ensure the provision of much needed support services in addition to supported accommodation. The program's performance has been evaluated at regular intervals&mdash;in 1988 and in 1993&mdash;under forms of agreement within this bill. In response to these reviews the program's focus has shifted from crisis services to facilitating the transition of service users from homelessness to independent living. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evaluation of SAAP Mark II entitled `<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moving forward</EMPHASIS>' released in June 1993 stated that SAAP had been successful in achieving its aims; SAAP should retain its primary role as a safety net; SAAP should incorporate an early intervention dimension; SAAP's objective should be to assist the homeless or people in crisis to make the transition to independent living through the provision of support and accommodation; and contained a recommendation that urgent action be taken to improve the availability of and access to appropriate and affordable housing, including public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that both the Commonwealth and the states have generally been satisfied with the operation of SAAP Mark II. Peak organisations like the National Youth Coalition for Housing, National Shelter and the Salvation Army have been satisfied with the current mix of crisis accommodation and transitional assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP Mark II has accommodated, referred and advocated for large numbers of homeless people. It has assisted large numbers of people to obtain their rightful entitlements in terms of income, in court or through other systems. It has provided support and safety to many suffering domestic violence and child abuse. It has developed and maintained links within the community and government sectors. However, the main barrier and one of the most overwhelming problems with SAAP is the lack of secure, affordable and appropriate housing for SAAP clients who wish to make the transition to independent living and the lack of community support structures to complement the transitional housing support role of SAAP. The government has continued to ignore the issue of supported accommodation and affordable housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that Senator Lees and I will be moving later today will bring these important elements within SAAP back into focus. Many SAAP clients have a need for supported accommodation and are not ready for independent living because of the life stage they are in or their crisis. Many outreach workers have articulated the difficulties in dealing with issues in a neighbourhood when people are placed inappropriately outside a residential supported service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SAAP Mark II has not been successful in assisting people in the transition to independent living because of inadequate exit points to assist people to move on. There is clear evidence of the pressing need to resolve the supply of affordable long-term housing which is falling far short of demand. The government has not addressed these problems in SAAP Mark III. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues in the Liberal and National parties have listened to the concerns of service provider organisations and peak housing bodies about the broader focus of this bill, which goes to the heart of the new direction of SAAP Mark III. The Senate committee last week, on which I know the Australian Democrats shared many of our concerns, also heard the evidence of key community organisations&mdash;and amendments to be considered in the committee stage later today reflect the sympathy that Senator Lees and the Democrats and my colleagues in the Liberal and National parties are prepared to give this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 5(2) and 5(3) aim to assist homeless people to achieve the maximum possible degree of self-reliance and independence. However, these clauses need to be amended to fine tune the legislation. This aim is to be achieved by service providers providing or arranging for the provision of services to resolve crisis; re-establish family links where appropriate; and re-establish clients' capacity to participate in community life and access related services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to fulfil these aims clients must have secure and supported accommodation in the interim until he or she is ready for transition towards long-term housing. Clause 7A sets out a new range of responsibilities for service providers, including case management, assessment and referral, and early intervention. Clause 7B states the types of assistance to which SAAP service providers should increase access for clients under SAAP including employment, education and training; health services, including mental health services; disability and rehabilitation services; children's support services; and income support. In short, what we have here is the government's expected framework on case management under SAAP Mark III. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unclear in this bill as to what case management will comprise and departmental officers were unclear on this issue at last week's detailed committee consideration. Many service providers have been case managing since the inception of the program. I would like to make a few points here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's Working Nation document envisages that over 500,000 unemployed people will be individually case managed. DEET is already experiencing significant problems in getting the case management system for long-term unemployed people up and running because of inadequate staffing resources. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs has also raised concerns about case management in the restructuring of SAAP. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless well co-ordinated the potential exists for an overlapping and duplication of services.</PARA>
<PARA>That report raises the issue of whether SAAP services are an appropriate auspice for this interventionist approach. It calls for close consultation with other Commonwealth and state departments which are providing similar case management to the same target group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads us to clause 10 of the bill which specifies that `SAAP will not replace or duplicate a service that is already provided by, or is the responsibility of, any other government, program or organisation' qualified, of course, by `other than with the consent of the federal minister and the state minister or ministers concerned.' We need to ask how often this consent will be sought if case management under SAAP Mark III comes into competition with other services and programs directed at the targeted group. In a letter to me Mr John Clegg, Chairperson of the National Youth Coalition for Housing, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SAAP has never been about specialist intervention in homeless peoples' lives, and nor should it be. Specialist services . . . will always be required by some homeless people. However, this does not mean that SAAP ought to deliver these services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These . . . are largely the responsibility of (other) state government and . . . Commonwealth program areas, and SAAP should not attempt to provide services in this area, simply because the supply of related services is inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>The ACT Council on Social Service asserts in its response to the SAAP draft national consumer outcome standards concerning resolving crisis:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the effective provision of a service which aims at resolving crises must also address the causes of the crises, and this, of necessity, demands considerable resources over and above what is already provided for treating the symptoms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any move towards a pro-active program must not be undertaken at the expense of the current level of service provision, even though that service might only be equipped to act in a reactive manner.</PARA>
<PARA>This broadened focus increases the responsibilities of SAAP service providers and widens the target area to include prevention work without providing additional resources to do this work effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the way this bill is framed it increases the problem of measuring SAAP's success against external factors which will now include high unemployment, poverty and the lack of other support services as well as the lack of affordable accommodation. Measured outcomes are a necessary and important element of measuring SAAP's success and we would hope that outcomes and/or targets in relation to people who are homeless will be clarified under the form of agreement within the bill. A letter from Mr Nathan Stirling of the Open Family (Aust.) Inc. states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently there is little attempt, or even acknowledgment by service providers, that outcomes should be measured. Yet it is fundamental. What other business in this country doesn't have measures of its service to clients?</PARA>
<PARA>SAAP already assists clients through their immediate crisis by helping them to access a range of services that they might require in meeting their needs. The reality is that some clients simply cannot achieve self-reliance or become part of the work force or participate in community life. Homeless&mdash;how does one define it? There are many interpretations and definitions of the word. The definition of `homelessness' within this bill is another weakening factor. I would have thought a person is deemed to be homeless if he or she does not have affordable, safe and secure accommodation or housing rather than having inadequate access to shelter. </PARA>

Yet it was not sent to the minister until 18 November and it has not been tabled here until today. That is simply not good enough. There is no justification, it seems to me, for this kind of delay, particularly when the Senate estimates examination of the arts portfolio took place last week. There should be a clear explanation as to why the report was not capable of being presented in time, particularly in view of the relevant reporting dates within the report that I have mentioned, or there should be some seeking of justification for holding up its presentation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like first to comment on Senator Baume's remarks relating to the tabling yet again of an enormous number of reports in the Senate. We have only half an hour to deal with them, which means there is an opportunity for only six senators to speak at this time, yet there are 43 reports to be considered. How can we scrutinise the other 37 that are missed? It gets worse than that. Eleven of these reports are in the area of arts and communications. It is an area of particular interest to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Baume, I would have liked to comment on a number of these reports&mdash;in particular, the report by the Australian Broadcasting Authority on R classified programs on pay TV, which has been the subject of inquiry by the Senate community standards committee. What has happened is that the ABA has put out a highly flawed report in terms of its research design and, therefore, in terms of its conclusions. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it started this research I was optimistic that one could measure these things. Having been a university researcher myself, in the end I concluded that what it was trying to measure, one could not really measure, anyway, because it was dealing with the area of attitudes, without giving the people who were to formulate an attitude sufficient data on which to base their opinion. I refer particularly to the qualitative research in which they actually showed people R-rated film clips. What they did not show was the full range of R. If we allow R-rated material to be shown on pay TV, it would mean that the full range of R-rated material could be shown. Yet in this research design it just showed middle-range R material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the quantitative research it did not even do that, of course, because it had a much bigger sample. So what it relied on was a definition of R. Again, this definition was highly flawed. How can people make a decision on whether they want R-rated material on pay TV if they are working from a flawed definition and if, in particular, one-third of the people who are asked the question had never seen an R-rated television program? So how can these people make a sensible decision on this matter?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is dishonest in some of its statements. It states areas of disagreement between the Senate community standards committee and the ABA. It mentions a number of areas of disagreement but just happens to miss out the main area of disagreement, which is the wording of the questions. What the research has done is to phrase questions in such a way that it will get the answer it wants. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yes, Prime Minister</EMPHASIS> there was a delightful story in which Sir Humphrey said, `Well, Prime Minister, if you build the railway tracks in a certain direction, that's the way the train will go.' That is what it has done with some of these questions. It has put propositions that hardly anyone could disagree with. A number of the questions are worded in this way. Question 9e reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">R Rated movies provide entertainment which is of interest to many adults and should be available to them on pay TV in the home.</PARA>
<PARA>The options for answering are to strongly agree through to strongly disagree. I do not disagree with a statement like that, nor would many people. But on the basis of that loosely worded question which is totally out of context it has delivered a report such as this and has made such a recommendation. When the committee said, `This research design is flawed,' it said, `Professor Durkin over in Western Australia has checked all this and it's all right.' We called Professor Durkin before the committee and he could not recall much about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its dealings with us it was most unreasonable. It did not take our advice.

Obviously, I have not had the chance to read it, but I think it contains some very useful material. Its final conclusions and what impact the document may have on the committee that Senator Tierney and I are working on to provide advice to the Senate before a decision is made about whether and under what circumstances R-rated material should be shown on pay TV are yet to be considered. But I think some useful material is contained in this document, although I accept Senator Tierney's legitimate criticisms in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I suppose I reject is the news release that accompanied this particular document which has a banner headline that may be shown across Australia tomorrow. It says `Australians say yes to R-rated programs on pay TV'. That is not what the research says. It is what the press release says, but it is not what the research says. In this respect I guess I am coming round to having some sympathy for certain aspects of what Senator Tierney said. In actual fact, what the research says is that people are uncomfortable about the unrestricted availability of R-rated material. People want controls and limitations to be put in place should R-rated material be approved for broadcast on pay TV and are keen to have information about the content of programs. That picks up on Senator Tierney's point about the range of film in the R-rated category that was shown for research purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA's research also found that there is more concern about the availability of R-rated sexual violence than there is about R-rated sexual content or R-rated violence. I think that indicates to members of this chamber that we will need to consider a range of issues when our report is finally brought in for debate and this whole question is being considered by this chamber. Clearly, the research does not give the green light to unrestricted R-rating, yet people would assume from a casual glance at the press release that the research has been done, it is all A-okay and R-rating on pay TV should go ahead unrestricted. That is certainly not the message of the very limited amount of material that I have looked at to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Senate to something which I think is extremely important. I refer to a table on page 102 which is headed `Attitudes to R-rated sexual violence on pay TV by gender'. I remind all members in this place and indeed in the other place that gender is a very important influence in Australia in 1994. Women vote on these issues, and women have very definite attitudes about certain matters. When it comes to R-rated sexual violence being shown on pay TV, 52 per cent of women said that R-rated sexual violence should not be permitted on pay TV under any circumstances. That is not a feature that has been picked up in the press release. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I do not want to be totally negative about this document&mdash;I think it contains some useful material, some of which I have just referred to&mdash;and I am not going to dismiss the findings, I think that this report needs very careful consideration and analysis. Complementing that will be the work of our committee. We hope to bring our report into the Senate early next year, prior to any decision being made about R-rating on pay TV. </PARA>

The proliferation of regional problems (armed conflicts, both between and within member states, economic crises, natural disasters, human rights abuses and the denial of democratic processes), which may have been dealt with during the Cold War through ideological competition or dampened by the threat of worldwide escalation as superpowers protected their "clients", has required a greater level of broad political input into UN problem resolution. The Australian electorate is increasingly involved in or concerned about those problems that are now imposing such huge demands on the UN that its capacity to deal adequately with them is at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In domestic political terms, the Australian public has a natural interest in the widespread deployment of our defence force personnel in UN missions in foreign countries with many of which Australia has little evident relationship; the Australian migrant community is concerned about conflicts affecting their original homelands; Australian taxpayers question the rapidly expanding costs as against the benefits of support for the UN's activities; many Australians disagree about the merits of Australian support for UN intervention in overseas disputes or the impact of its conventions on Australia's internal affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of Parliamentary Advisers in this crisis time for the UN, when it has unlimited demands being made upon it but severely limited resources, is two-pronged: firstly, to contribute on the spot to the debate about Australia's proper role in all these matters and secondly, to seek (where appropriate) to enhance the understanding and support within their own political parties and through the parliamentary process, not only for Australia's actions within this world forum, but support for the UN itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian electorate's preparedness to continue to fund the United Nations depends on its acceptance of the bipartisan political message that without an effective UN, Australia's peace and prosperity could be at greater risk. At the same time, Australia's mission at the UN benefits from having access to professional political views as to the likely political consequences of the positions it takes in the UNGA negotiations, particularly those that may generate political concerns and put bipartisanship at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So the proper role of a parliamentary adviser is essentially that of a two-way information and advisory street, allied to a key role of active participation in UNGA committees to share the workload with mission staff and, in doing so, gain a greater understanding of the practical difficulties involved in attempting to get the Australian point of view understood, accepted and converted into positive action at the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While coming away from New York with a heightened understanding of, and respect for, the institutions of the UN, we nevertheless have some serious concerns about aspects of its activities. The loss of key, and in our view very impressive personnel under the Director-Generalship of Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali has not enhanced the status or competence of the organisation (the high level briefings given to parliamentarians by top UN officials had indicated to us the high calibre of those executives who subsequently left the organisation); the clear conflict between the US, the major source of finance for the UN, and the Secretary-General (along with justifiable dissatisfaction about inadequate budgetary controls); growing disenchantment with Mr Boutros-Ghali by many delegations; and the continuing power struggle between the General Assembly and the Security Council, had added to the difficulties the UN faces in seeking to demonstrate its capacity to handle the world's problems.</PARA>

<PARA>As I have honourable colleagues who wish to speak on other matters, I will be very brief. It is very interesting to see the way in which astronomy has developed in the period since I was a young boy, when the study of objects within the solar system was the principal interest of many observers using telescopes. These days, of course, the interest lies as a result of space exploration with looking at stellar objects. But of course this year's report is quite interesting because the cover is a photograph of the trail made by fragments of the comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 on its way to Jupiter. It was as a result of the work at the Anglo-Australian Observatory and the AAT there that they were able to take that photograph, and I think it is truly a spectacular photograph and shows the high quality of the work they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of interest, too, is the work outlined on pages 30 to 32 and the fine work that is being done by the observatory in mapping the structure of galaxies. Particularly interesting is the filamentary structure, which is demonstrated by the illustration on page 31, and the issues they raise in terms of the structure of galaxies and the bubble sheets, walls and filaments that appear in the way in which stellar objects are structured and aligned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on at great lengths on this document.

<PARA>I wish to speak briefly because, due to time constraints, unfortunately I could not speak on the rural adjustment scheme report that was handed down by my colleague Senator Brownhill yesterday. So I take this opportunity to make some brief comments on this particular report, and I may run into the subject of the report that was tabled by my colleague yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the total expenditure of RAS during the last year was $172 million, of which the Commonwealth government contributed $150 million and the states $21 million. There were something like 16,600 applications of all elements of RAS and approvals totalled 11,882. These numbers and the amount of money and the fact that we have a rural debt of something like $17 billion, point to the fact that we all know of, and that we have been talking about in this place for quite some considerable time, and that is the dire straits out there in the rural areas. It is not just the drought areas. As we toured around Australia looking at how the RAS scheme was operating we saw that it was not just the drought areas that were suffering; it was just about everywhere for all sorts of different reasons, but mainly the rural recession, the recession we had to have, and also dry times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice the government has announced three new policy directions for RAS 1992, and I have noted them here: the need for greater focus on assisting farmers to improve their technical, financial and risk management skill; the need for a better linking of RAS to other Commonwealth and state-territory farm improvement programs, including agribusiness and landcare programs; and the need for rental assistance to be better tailored to address the regional adjustment needs. The report of the rural and regional affairs committee that we put down yesterday picks up these three particular recommendations plus quite a few more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will refer to some of the recommendations to be made. We came to the unanimous view in the committee that there needed to be a more consistent and uniform approach to adjustment measures and the guidelines needed to be more prescriptive. One of the things we did notice looking through the rural adjustment scheme was that there was no mechanism in place to monitor the effectiveness of the scheme. One would have thought after all this time that there should have been something in place to monitor the effectiveness of the scheme. I suppose if there had been we would not have needed to have another inquiry into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly there is a very important place for the rural adjustment scheme. It has been known over the years by many other names&mdash;I forget what it was called then, but I was a member of it in my early farming days. We believe that there are a lot of doubts and questions about this particular scheme as it is operating now. We recommended that the government should revamp the scheme on the basis of the recommendations we made in the report. As I said, the main thrust of our report was that RAS should be used to continue to encourage farm productivity, profitability and sustainability and the major recommendation in this report was of course that the exceptional circumstances should be treated separately. That was the most important part because it was confusing the adjustment side of the rural adjustment scheme. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

The chairman, Senator Ferguson, and his South Australian colleague Senator Chapman I believe deserve considerable congratulations for the report that was brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report highlights a number of areas where reform could take place within the CSIRO&mdash;matters which I note in June of this year were completely and utterly rejected by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook). I had the opportunity earlier today to reflect on some comments I made on 6 June 1994 concerning this very matter of CSIRO funding and its future. It was interesting for me to note in the debate in which the minister interjected with such comments as, `Cloak yourself with ignorance, then,' and things of that nature that I raised a number of issues&mdash;which I happened to have found in the recommendations at the very front of the report&mdash;which have been addressed and were seen as issues worthy of addressing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised issues such as whether the abolition of the institute structure, as institutes ought be considered because of the fact that they did not add any value to CSIRO. I also posed questions as to why, when private sector management is flat with minimal middle management, does the CSIRO have so many levels of management? I note that in chapter 1, recommendation 1, there is a recommendation to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . restructure the CSIRO to reduce the layers of management, including the need to modify or eliminate the Institute structure;</PARA>
<PARA>So I am very pleased that the committee made those findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I further questioned whether it was the best use of working scientists to require them to spend so much time in administration as opposed to research related activities. It is pleasing to note that, as part of recommendation 1, there is the talk of streamlining administration and reducing excessive accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raised the question of countercyclical funding to ensure a sustainable long-term research base for those industries that are providing funds on the levy basis. I happen to note that recommendation 10, in fact, is headed `Countercyclical Funding', and that seems to have been taken on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also raised questions about why the CSIRO placed agricultural research high in its priority setting, but appears to disregard these criteria when allocating appropriation funding. I note that recommendation 3 of the report suggests that CSIRO reinstate the high priority ranking of rural research and ensure that the share of appropriation funding of rural research is increased commensurate with that ranking. Before I move on, there was also the question of the sale of a number of their research stations. I am very pleased to see that under chapter 3, where it deals with restructuring programs, the committee came out in favour of retaining a number of the research stations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I believe this report is a most satisfactory outcome for the CSIRO and the rural industries in Australia that have come to rely upon the CSIRO for a lot of research. The CSIRO clearly did have a lack of morale. I believe it still has that problem. During the past months, I have had the opportunity of discussing privately with a number of CSIRO researchers the problems as they perceived them within the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report of Senator Ferguson, Senator Chapman and other senators has really addressed those issues very well. I believe they can feel confident that if these recommendations are picked up by the CSIRO board and by the government, CSIRO and, in particular, the agricultural research area will be restored to the glory that they deserve and they that they enjoyed in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply conclude my remarks by congratulating the committee on its wide ranging report and for addressing some of those issues that were made known to me some six months ago. I trust that the people who provided me with the information I raised in the Senate some six months ago are satisfied that those matters have now been addressed in this report, which was brought down this afternoon by the chairman of that committee, Senator Ferguson. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The allegations which they have made in this letter, which honourable senators will be able to read in detail when they get a copy, clearly show that there are matters that require investigation&mdash;particularly the use of money which has been provided by ATSIC to take groups of Aboriginal children as dancers away on trips. The end to which that money seems to have been applied certainly requires investigation&mdash;as do some of the other matters that have been raised in relation to money supplied by ATSIC to pay Mr Burt Button to attend ATSIC meetings and functions and how that was money was accounted for. Those matters are of serious concern, as are the concerns raised on the third page of the document in relation to the Aboriginal Legal Service. </PARA>
