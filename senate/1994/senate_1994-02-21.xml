<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and is in light of the comments of the Minister for Finance yesterday that the government's intention to raise taxes is again `on the table'. I remind the minister of the broken promises budget of last year&mdash;which related to the tax issue&mdash;and the pledge by the then Treasurer late last year that there would be `no further need for any need for any future tax increases'. I ask the minister: does government policy change with a change of minister, and are the Australian people now being softened up for yet another round of tax increases in breach of the previous Treasurer's promise?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If anything at all was said yesterday, it would rather indicate to the contrary. I have no comment whatsoever to make about any tax changes the government may or may not be proposing to contemplate in this budget. The question of the future of the jobs levy and the pros and cons of that has been amply debated already. Even in the absence of any explicit government commitment one way or another, these are matters that will be resolved in the budgetary process and it is inappropriate to comment further at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to a meeting last week in Geneva of the steering committee of the comprehensive plan of action for Indochinese refugees. This meeting, convened by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, discussed the issue of Vietnamese boat people. According to the media reports, the outcome of that meeting is that Vietnamese boat people will now be treated in the same way as asylum seekers from other countries.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="765" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He asked me about that at the weekend. I thank the honourable senator for what is a significant question. The conference to which he refers, which was the fifth meeting of the steering committee of the comprehensive plan of action&mdash;the CPA&mdash;for Indochinese refugees, was convened in Geneva by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mrs Ogata, and was a significant development in the CPA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPA has been an important part of the process of resettling Indochinese refugees. In 1989, the CPA was adopted in response to the humanitarian crisis caused by the continuing outflow of Indochinese asylum seekers during the 1980s. It put in place special arrangements for the reception, processing, resettlement and return of asylum seekers. An important part of the CPA was to consolidate an orderly migration program from Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting held in Geneva last week, at which once again Australia was represented at a very senior level, came to four important decisions. Firstly, with respect to the people involved, as at 14 February 1994, Vietnamese arriving in CPA countries by boat would be considered in the same way as asylum seekers from any other country. Secondly, the end of 1995 was set as a target date for bringing the work of the comprehensive plan of action and first asylum countries to a close. The third part of the decision, and an important aspect, is that there was agreement by countries, including the United States, for the use of non-voluntary return of non-refugees. In this context, countries hope that, with US support, together with the lifting of the US trade embargo on Vietnam, those non-refugees still in camps would now opt for voluntary return. But to put this aspect of the decision in perspective, at the end of last year there were 48,000 Vietnamese non-refugees in five camps throughout the region&mdash;about half of them in Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of the decision relates to the residual case load, that is, people who have been in comprehensive plan of action countries who have been screened but, because of health and character problems, have not been resettled. It is expected some several thousand of those people will be in this category by the end of 1995. First asylum countries consider that these people should be accepted by Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPA, as it does draw to a close, has had numerous and quite significant achievements. Since its inception in 1989, the number of persons leaving Indochina by boat has reduced to a trickle, and the resettlement of refugees has continued. Some 60,000 people have returned home under the CPA arrangements. It should be noted that the UNHCR ensures that the returns are carried out in conditions of safety and dignity and, of course, maintains a comprehensive monitoring program in Vietnam for returnees. To assist the resettlement, the repatriation, the international community funds special projects to assist communities where these returnees have settled. It should be noted that Australia has allocated $100 million to development assistance in Vietnam through its overseas aid program, the end result of part of which would be to assist such resettlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has played an important role in this process, not just in terms of its contribution to the CPA, but also in terms of its reception of people under this program. Since 1989, for instance, 15,000 Vietnamese and Laotian refugees have been resettled in Australia. In 1993-94, a further 2,200 refugees will be accepted in Australia. As I said, the CPA is now drawing to a conclusion. People have already been returned to their homes with dignity, but as it draws to a conclusion it is acknowledged in the region that it has been an important initiative in which Australia has played an important role. It is an example of multilateral cooperation in response to what was an immense regional crisis. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Cook, in his capacity as Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development, and as the minister representing both the Treasurer and the Minister for Finance. As Senator Gareth Evans has stonewalled on this vital question, I refer Senator Cook to the deep internal split within the Labor Party over the jobs levy proposal, and to the comments of his colleague Senator Carr this morning in support of a levy when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I actually got in the sun. I apologise to Senator Richardson for not `slip, slop, slapping' in an appropriate way. If Senator Short wants to participate in any internal Labor Party debate, then he should resign from his party and join the Labor Party. This is not a forum in which I propose to canvass the various views that are often expressed, sometimes in a robust way, in internal debate in a democratic party like the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the jobs levy, there was a green paper on employment which was a report to the government. It is not a government proposal; it is contained in a report to the government. That, along with all the other recommendations in the green paper report, is of course being considered in a process that we are engaged in, in producing a white paper on employment. It stems from our concern about how one deals with long-term unemployment and a number of other aspects of the jobs market. When the white paper is finally brought down it will doubtless cover issues like industry policy and regional development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in the gestation phase. We have a report to us, and it is necessary for us to consider it. Therefore, it is accurate to describe it as being on the table in front of us. We have not yet responded to it. When we do, we will report our response to the parliament. Until that time, questions on this subject are idle or simply mischievous in order to try to stir up some esoteric political point that the opposition, divided as it is, would like to make in order to distract attention from itself.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must say Senator Cook's obfuscation makes Senator Evans look positively forthcoming. I ask the Minister again, as he failed to answer any of the questions that I put to him, whether he agrees with the comments of Senator Carr who, as I understand it, is the convener of a major faction within the government? Does he agree with Senator Carr's comments, firstly, that we need more revenue raising options in the budget and, secondly, that the views of cabinet ministers like Mr Beazley and Senator Cook himself on this issue are not in accord with those of caucus? I again invite him to explain to the Senate how a jobs levy would create one additional job. I ask that this time he have a go at answering some of those questions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction to this supplementary question was that I had failed to answer. I did not fail to answer; I declined to answer. I deliberately declined to answer on the basis that it is none of Senator Short's business&mdash;absolutely none; and it has nothing to do with the processes of this Senate what internal debate there is within the Labor Party. So Senator Short will remain disappointed on that subject, unless he wants to do the noble thing and join our ranks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the issue of the jobs levy, that was a recommendation that was put as an option in a paper canvassing options for employment, in particular dealing with the long-term unemployed. That is a report to the government, and we will respond to that. I am not going to respond here. As I have said, it is in gestation. We will respond to it in a proper, measured and responsible way in due course.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of that interjection,  Senator Ferguson should just wait one minute. For consistency, I am expecting a censure motion in respect of this answer. Programs include the telecentres program, which aims to improve access to communications technology in rural Australia; the countrylink program, which provides information on government services; and the rural access program. The RAP aims to improve skills and training and provide better access in remote areas to health services and information. It helps local groups in small, isolated rural communities to become involved in providing services relevant to their own areas. To date, 337 of these communities have received assistance. I have just approved funding of in excess of $255,000 for 26 projects under the second round of rural access program grants for 1993-94.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful projects include providing funding to enable a student hostel development in Chinchilla in Queensland to operate 12 months earlier than planned&mdash;for Senator Boswell's interest, that is in a National Party electorate&mdash;and also a tractor safety project in Moree, which is in the electorate of the Deputy Leader of the National Party, John Anderson. That tractor safety project is designed to respond to the ministerial advisory group on farm safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the preponderance of these grants are in fact in National Party electorates. As I said before in response to Senator Ferguson's interjection, in view of consistency I do expect to be censured by the opposition about that. RAP is community driven. To be successful for these grants projects must demonstrate active community support, either in cash or through contributions such as personal services or the provision of venues and equipment provided free of charge.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. I refer to media reports that the government is unlikely to implement most of the Kelty regional development task force recommendations. Is the minister still actively considering the task force recommendations for a significant increase to the road building program, for additional support for further wool and fibre processing, for the retention of the pharmaceutical industry development program, for the retention of the shipbuilding bounty and for enhancing the information technology strategy? Secondly, does the minister agree that failure to proceed as recommended would have significant negative effect on regional employment, particularly since Australian investment and superannuation funds continue to flow unchecked into Asia to create jobs there?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can tell Senator Spindler that our policy formulation process is on track and moving according to timetable. The government, as I have said, will probably bring down, around budget time, a white paper which will respond to those issues of employment, industry policy and regional development&mdash;all of those things. In the regional development area, we have before us the Kelty report on regional Australia, there is an Industry Commission report, and I am in anticipation of a report from McKinsey and Company Inc. on business investment in regions, which report is due at the end of this month. I think it is appropriate that we have all of those recommendations before us and respond to them across the board. At this stage that is my intention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a big agenda and it is certainly an important one. No-one would ever underestimate the importance and significance of the issues before us. There is widespread interest across the board about all of these matters. We have received a huge number of submissions on them. Indeed, I have seen reports over the weekend that even government caucus members have put specific views in public. All of those things will, of course, be properly and reasonably considered by the government when it formulates its response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are 137 different recommendations in the Kelty report. I thank Senator Spindler for indicating some of the areas on which his interest focuses, but I add that the report contains a number of other significant recommendations, some of which concern taxation, some of which concern education and a range of other things as well. All of those things have to be responded to. We will do so when we have completed our process. I will answer Senator Spindler's question but in the form of the statement when it comes down.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I am certain the minister will be aware of recent developments in Burma involving Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, including the call on her last week by US Congressman Bill Richardson, and indications over very recent days that talks might even be held between her and General Khin Nyunt of the SLORC. At the same time, there have been reports that her period of detention may be extended for a further six months. What is the reaction of the Australian government to these apparently conflicting responses in Burma?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="768" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the first place, the relaxation of the conditions of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's detention involved in allowing access to her by United States Congressman Richardson in his visit last Monday, 14 February, is a very positive step by the Burmese State Law and Order Council&mdash;or SLORC&mdash;and one which we unequivocally welcome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also particularly welcome indications of a possible meeting between General Khin Nyunt, who is secretary of the SLORC, and Aung San Suu Kyi. We very much hope that such a meeting will take place and that it might lead to a wider dialogue on the issues confronting Burma, including the process of national reconciliation and an improvement of human rights as well as, of course, to the immediate and unconditional release of Aung San Suu Kyi, which we and the rest of the international community have long been calling for. Such a dialogue is an absolutely crucial element in any process of reconciliation that might be contemplated in Burma. Again, it is one that we have long advocated as an important first step. We just hope there is some reality to that prospect, but the reports at the moment have not yet confirmed that that will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other report which, however, points in the other direction and is disconcerting and that is the suggestion that the SLORC has extended Aung San Suu Kyi's period of detention until January 1995. Prior to these reports there had been speculation that she would be released in July this year. General Khin Nyunt has said that a decision on her period of detention has not been made. We obviously hope that the SLORC will send an unambiguously positive signal by releasing her in the short term, but I have to say there has still been no real indication that it is prepared to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Australia continues to work away quietly in the hope of making a positive contribution to the resolution of the continuing tragic situation in Burma. In particular, a couple of weeks ago we convened an experts workshop jointly with the Griffith University centre for the study of Australia-Asia relations. The participants in that workshop included regional and other academics with specialist knowledge of the situation in Burma and broader regional affairs and conflict resolution. The workshop was intended to generate a fresh infusion of ideas from various key people around the world who are knowledgeable about this area on how national reconciliation in Burma might be achieved and what role the international community might play.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very much in keeping with our strong support for what is called second track diplomacy as a tool in seeking solutions to complex problems of this kind. I hope that the ideas that emerge from that workshop, which were quite substantial, will prove useful. At the present moment the government is giving close consideration to them and how they might be advanced. It may be that, before too long, I will be in a position to say something further publicly about that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Our embassy has been very closely following developments in East Timor, not least since the Dili massacre. But we have never obtained any evidence to suggest that the number of deaths was anything like the scale that has now been alleged in this latest Pilger documentary. At the time I said that our best estimate of those killed was about 75. The commission of inquiry established by the Indonesian government rejected, of course, the initial official figure of 19 deaths and estimated about 50 deaths. There are other assessments which have put the figure at anywhere between 50 and 200, but none of them seem to be based on hard or substantial evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time our embassy assessed that the discrepancy between claims concerning the number of people killed and claims about the number of bodies counted in the cemetery did indicate that there might conceivably have been a second series of killings which took place away from the cemetery. However, we found then and still find any evidence for such a second series of killings to be quite sketchy and circumstantial. In particular, we have no evidence at all to confirm the claims that have been made concerning the treatment of wounded East Timorese at the local military hospital. There were no allegations at the time or subsequently, until now, that a second series of killings did take place at the military hospital. And there have also been what I might describe as reasonably credible witnesses, like Father Wanandi who does have some connections and associations with the government but nonetheless is a Jesuit priest in high standing who reportedly administered communion at the hospital daily at the time to wounded East Timorese students. We now have his public statement in the past few days dismissing Pilger's allegations concerning events at the hospital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, it is the case as I said publicly yesterday that there is a conflict of evidence about some of these things and it is not possible yet to finally draw the line on what precisely happened, when and where and how many people were in fact killed and how many remain unaccounted for. Our ambassador in Jakarta accordingly raised these reports, as has been made public, with Indonesia's Foreign Minister, Ali Alatas, when he met him last week. If the allegations did prove to be true the Australian government would, of course, voice its very strong concerns, as we did clearly and persistently at the time of the Dili killings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the time, and I repeat it now because this goes to the last part of the question, we have no evidence to suggest that these killings were a deliberate act of state policy in any way. Rather, all the evidence seemed to be that they were a case of aberrant behaviour by elements of the military.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the Indonesian government's actions following the killings, the establishment of the independent commission of inquiry, the sentences that were awarded to security authorities through the Military Honour Council, the unprecedented statements of regret by President Suharto, all amounted to a really credible response to the event.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have continued to urge the Indonesian government to clarify the number and status of those missing. I have raised this with Foreign Minister Alatas on a number of occasions; our embassy in Jakarta has recently raised it again. The Indonesian government has informed the UN Secretary-General that 56 people remain missing. That is the latest of a successive series of pronouncements by the government about those missing, the previous statement from armed forces spokesmen putting it at 64.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware of discrepancies between those figures and those of the independent commission of inquiry which found that 91 people were missing. That is part of the reason why, for example, at the Commission on Human Rights last year we voted in favour of a resolution expressing concern about the lack of information on the number of people killed in November 1991, and urging the Indonesian government to account fully for those missing. We remain concerned about the absence of final and conclusive evidence on this whole question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the past two or three months there have been some press stories about disputes going on between various bodies responsible for carrying out standards or technical infrastructure matters in the Australian economy. As a result of some of that controversy, in December last year I convened a meeting between a number of the industry groups to discuss these matters. There were increasing numbers of representations to me from industry saying that these matters had to be cleared up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to say that, although this sounds a very dry and boring area, technical infrastructure or standards is a very important area for Australian industry. We in the industry portfolio see it as being an important area of micro-economic reform.

Those standards also equate with our export drives, so the standards we have in Australia for industry are also relevant to our international markets.</PARA>

I have asked both these bodies to respond to me about ways in which this controversy can be overcome so that we can have in Australia a simple and transparent system of maintaining standards which is cheap and efficient to industry and also easily understood.

Whilst Drs Clarke and Latham may have only been writing or speaking about these issues recently in the statements Senator Coulter cites, they are hardly newly identified problems. They are problems which we are making our own contribution to addressing through the aid program and also through our input into the multitude of international environmental bodies that have been coming to grips with these various problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission on Sustainable Development, for instance, in which Australia is particularly active, has, as its name would imply, a mandate to promote policies in which economic development is balanced against environmental considerations and to assist developing countries in that regard.</PARA>

The fact of the matter is that there is no absolute inconsistency between economic development of the kind which is occurring in such a dynamic fashion in the Asia-Pacific region and environmental protection. A cogent argument can in fact be made that countries experiencing economic development will&mdash;at least eventually&mdash;be much better placed financially and otherwise to deal with problems such as population pressure and various other environmental problems that are associated with this age and the technology of the age, and the population pressures within the country in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An equally cogent argument could also be made that a trade war, which Senator Coulter also seems to think has some bearing on this, between the United States and Japan could have such deleterious effects on countries in the Asia-Pacific region, if it were to be pursued to its most alarming conclusion, that any hopes of their rapidly being able to solve the environmental problems they already have would be seriously diminished thereby.

This decision allowed speedier payment of Austudy for families suffering a sudden income drop. Unfortunately, the budget decision was misinterpreted in the material circulated to students, which stated that all holders of a health care card were exempt from the Austudy assets test. This was not the intention of the decision.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can hear it if you want to; I was trying to save the Senate time. If it is the wish of the Senate, I will read the statement. I wish to make a statement concerning the debate which took place following my statement during question time on 10 February 1994 concerning resolution No. 9 of the Senate Privilege Resolutions and senators' exercise of their right of freedom of speech in the Senate. I wish to refer to some questions asked of me and points raised during that debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had prepared the substance of the statement in advance, entirely on my own initiative, so that I could make it at a suitable opportunity. It was a general statement not applicable to any particular incident or circumstance in the Senate, and it resulted from long-standing concerns about such allegations made both in the chamber and before estimates committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I considered that the time at which I made the statement was an appropriate time to make it because, in the course of the asking and answering of a question, there was a dispute, the basis of which was a suggestion that allegations were being made of improper conduct against other persons. I made no judgment about whether allegations were being made or whether those allegations were unsubstantiated or had some foundation. The fact that it was suggested that allegations were being made and that this was leading to dispute during question time indicated to me that it was an appropriate time for me to make the statement. It was also appropriate because at question time most senators are present and that is the time when disputes of this sort are likely to arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In retrospect, I accept that it might have been more appropriate to make the statement at the end of question time. In making the statement, I was acting in accordance with resolution No. 9 of the Privilege Resolutions, paragraph (2) of which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the President, whenever the President considers that it is desirable to do so, may draw the attention of the Senate to the spirit and the letter of this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>The substantive part of the resolution, which the President is empowered to draw to the attention of the Senate whenever the President considers it desirable, sets out matters which senators should take into account in speaking in the Senate. The resolution does not permit or require the President to draw any conclusions about anything which has been said in the Senate, nor does it permit or require the President to link a statement with any particular remarks in the Senate, and I did not do either of those things. I therefore believe that I acted in accordance with resolution No. 9. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of resolution No. 9 and its authorisation of the President to draw attention to its terms involve no inhibition on senators' right of freedom of speech; on the contrary, the resolution is a recognition of that right. My statement drawing the attention of the Senate to the resolution similarly did not involve any inhibition on senators' right of freedom of speech but a recognition of that right which is upheld by the resolution. I made this clear in the preamble to the statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate it was suggested that the intention of resolution No. 9 was that senators should take into account the matters set out in the resolution when speaking about persons other than members of the Senate or the House of Representatives. I do not believe that this is a correct interpretation of the resolution. Subparagraph (1)(c) enjoins senators to take into account, as one of the list of matters which they should take into account, the limited opportunities for persons other than members of parliament to respond to allegations made in parliament, but that does not mean that senators are enjoined by the resolution to take into account the listed matters only when speaking of persons outside parliament. The resolution is in general terms. The explanatory note tabled with the resolution when it was moved confirms that the intention was that senators should take those matters into account when speaking about any person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was suggested in the debate that my action was unprecedented. On the contrary, the chair on at least two occasions in the past has been moved to draw attention to resolution No. 9 by matters arising in debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I believe that I have acted entirely in accordance with resolution No. 9 of the Privilege Resolutions of the Senate. If the juxtaposition of my statement with a particular question has given rise to offence, I apologise for such offence. I nevertheless stand by the substance of my statement, which, I repeat, was a general statement, and ask that all honourable senators pay close attention to resolution No. 9 when framing questions, whether at committee hearings or in the Senate chamber. </PARA>

But I am puzzled by your statement today, `I made no judgment about whether allegations were being made, or whether those allegations were unsubstantiated or had some foundation'.

In response to that, you said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing practice of senators making a series of unsubstantiated allegations and throwing mud in the hope that some will stick is, I believe, frequently an abuse of parliamentary privilege.</PARA>
<PARA>In those circumstances, it is very hard for us to understand how you would then come into the chamber today and say you were not making any judgment on whether there were unsubstantiated allegations.

We do not make allegations without evidence to support those allegations. That is the way in which we have operated and the way that we will continue to operate. But we will not allow resolution No. 9 to inhibit us in our responsibility of pursuing ministers and trying to bring them to account and, in particular, the issues that are causing us major concern about the potential conflict of interest that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has got himself into between the responsibilities of his office and his very large personal business interests.

I thank you for that apology because I certainly was offended by the remarks, particularly in that context. Nonetheless, I am concerned about some implications of the statement. It seems to me that you are saying that the question of possible abuse of parliamentary privilege clearly does not now apply to the question I asked, and your apology seems to suggest that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously it has been established that my statement did not involve any such abuse of parliamentary privilege. I take it, Mr President, that your clarifying statement today, where you said that you were going to intervene at this point because you had been concerned over some time at what appeared to be the possible abuse of parliamentary privilege, clearly now does not relate to my question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That raises the following matter. In your explanatory statement today, you said that you would make a statement at a suitable opportunity and later said that you were empowered to draw it to the attention of the Senate wherever the President considers it desirable. Clearly, of course, it has been established, I think, by your own statement that it was not desirable by any test to do so immediately after I asked the factual and proper question. Nor was it a suitable opportunity directly after I asked a proper and direct substantiated question. As you know, Mr President, I substantiated the facts of that question by tabling the documents that I had searched from the Australian Securities Commission which had been available to Senator Gareth Evans for more than a year had he wished to look at them, when he described the question as containing `unsubstantiated allegations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, it is worth noting that your statement was not applicable to any particular incident or circumstance in the Senate, that it might have been more appropriate to make the statement at the end of question time, and that if the juxtaposition caused offence you were sorry for it. In that context, unfortunately the media clearly took it to be a matter directly related to my question. Continually, the media have remarked on it not only in the news items of the day but also in follow-up stories such as on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS>. The clear inference has been made by the media that you, Mr President, were indicating that my question was a possible abuse of parliamentary privilege. The matter even went to the extent of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Order in the House</EMPHASIS> running an item about my question by substituting a totally different question from the one I asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite extraordinary the way in which this matter has been handled by the media without mentioning the specific detailed substantiated question I had asked, which related to which version of the debt owing to Mr John Brown by Mr Keating's companies should be believed. I said there were four different versions. I apologise for that, as there were five. One return did not mention the debt at all. I suppose failure to mention by omission is another version of the debt. But it ranges from nil to $4.5 million, the debt owed by the Prime Minister's companies to Mr John Brown, a former minister, a former ministerial colleague, a man who lobbies very effectively on behalf of various interest groups in this parliament and who is on some governmental bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a totally proper question. Yet as a result of the unfortunate juxtaposition of your statement, Mr President, in relation to which, as I say, I am grateful for your apology, the media universally took the line that it was directed at my piggery questions rather than at that particular piggery question.

I am demonstrating that while I am grateful for your apology, I am still concerned about the suggestion that there were unsubstantiated allegations; and the very phrase you used was the phrase used improperly and disgracefully by Senator Evans who knew that what he was saying was wrong.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I draw to your attention that fact.

He kept saying it was unsubstantiated muckraking when I said the Prime Minister's company's accounts were false, that they had not been delivered in appropriate time to the Securities Commission, and that they had to be amended by something like an aggregate of $5 million for understating losses and overstating assets. </PARA>

Yet when a member of this chamber, who happens to be the senator representing the Prime Minister in this chamber, accuses me, without one shred of evidence being presented, of making a set of unsubstantiated allegations in a statement, you, Mr President, were prepared to accept that as a suitable opportunity to make a statement of this nature. All I am saying is that this clearly was not a suitable opportunity. Your apology to an extent acknowledges the fact that it could have been better timed. </PARA>

I entreat you, Mr President, that if you consider such interventions in future you have a much greater degree of recognition of Senator Evans's track record of setting out on a deliberate and political campaign of denigration. He has never answered the substance of any one of these well-documented, factual questions relating to the Prime Minister's involvement in an $80 million multinational joint piggery venture, which has a whole series of question marks hanging over it, none of which have been adequately responded to by this government and on which he has not given one iota of hard evidence. I would suggest that if you are to take any notice of this man's nonsense in the future it may be a good idea if you asked him to substantiate whatever nonsensical point he was trying to make. </PARA>

Senator Baume is one of those people who just cannot take yes for an answer. He cannot accept language of the kind that you offered today without seeking, in turn, to make something of it for squalid, partisan reasons of the kind we have come utterly to expect from him. Whether the juxtaposition of your statement from the chair with Senator Baume's prior question was appropriate or not depends, I suppose, on whether one chooses to describe Senator Baume's question as amounting to an allegation&mdash;whether substantiated or not&mdash;as distinct from an inference, implication, innuendo or some other form of imputation. </PARA>

Let me say quickly and succinctly for the record that the nub of Senator Baume's question was that there was something in the nature of a loan outstanding from Brown and Hatton, and John Brown in particular, to the Prime Minister which exposed the Prime Minister to some sort of obligation or potential improper influence should Mr Brown choose to exercise it. The subtext of the question was that there was some mystery about the amount of that particular loan, and it was repeated again today because there have been multiple versions of it according to the various documents that have been in one way or another on the public record. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make absolutely clear is that the so-called `loan'&mdash;and I use the expression in inverted commas&mdash;is payable only at the discretion of the directors themselves. It is payable only at the discretion of the directors who notionally have the obligation to pay it or who would have the clear cut obligation if it were a formal legal loan. That is made perfectly clear, as Senator Baume himself acknowledges in his own statement somewhere on 10 February. He quoted from a document that stated that the $4 million&mdash;he refers to $4 million but the figure, as I said, is $2.76 million&mdash;</PARA>

He quoted from the document that stated that the $4 million will be paid only if the company's directors so determine and if the company makes sufficient profits and has sufficient funds available to pay the additional price in question. I repeat, the accounts made clear that any amount payable to Mr Brown is payable only at the director's discretion. Senator Baume knew that. The payment of any funds to Mr Brown from this provision is payable on the determination of the managers and directors of the company. The point to be made here, of course, is that Mr Keating is not now, and never has been, such a manager or a director. Moreover, the matter was determined by the former directors.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I do not want to comment at length on your statement, as Senator Evans did, but there are a few matters arising from it that I would like to raise. Firstly, I thank you for your statement and I endorse everything that Senator Hill has said with respect to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A Speaker from the British parliament once made the point that he had neither the eyes to see, the ears to hear nor the mouth to speak save as directed by his chamber. That was his way of indicating that the role of Presidents and Speakers is not to follow their personal interest but to apply the standing orders as set by their chambers. I am therefore somewhat perplexed by your frequent reference to your longstanding concern over this matter of privilege. Whether or not you are concerned is not the issue; you have your job to do and you are required to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether you can assist those of us who have not seen that concern evidenced. I have been here only nine years. Since you have been here longer, perhaps you could cite from <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the occasions when you have raised this matter or produce the letters that you have sent to the President of the Senate because this matter has been so troubling you over such a long period. I make that request not so much for you to verify the fact that you have this longstanding interest but to acquaint us with the depth of that interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to your statement, you say&mdash;and, as Senator Hill said, we accept&mdash;that it was not made on anyone's instructions. I remind you of what I have said earlier: it is very unfortunate that you chose to make that statement in question time, following, as it did, Senator Baume's allegations about Mr Keating and the response from Senator Gareth Evans to the effect that they were unsubstantiated allegations. That was another example of Senator Evans's belief that it is improper for us to raise a question in here because it necessarily becomes an allegation unless it can be substantiated&mdash;in other words, unless we already know the answer. That is a non sequitur. It should be obvious to anyone that that is a ludicrous proposition for Senator Evans to make and I suggest it would be a ludicrous one for you to endorse, Mr President. Why would anyone bother asking a question if one already knew the answer? If one knew the answers with respect to these matters, people would be reading about it in the papers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Times will change and the tide will turn, and one day those opposite will be sitting on this side of the chamber. They might believe that the time is further away than we think it is but that is a matter for debate. One day they will be sitting on this side and they should be aware that this is a matter of parliamentary interest and not just a political dispute. We could raise a number of examples where allegations have been hotly denied by those on the other side and have then turned out to have some substance to them. One was the entire Burke affair. Senator Gareth Evans's first response to that matter was that there was nothing to it at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there was the Marshall Islands affair, which was similarly responded to in the first instance. The accusation was that the allegations were false. That will always be the response from those on the other side. Perhaps they believe at the time that the allegations are false and that there is no substance to them. But if some of those on the other side had done something wrong&mdash;be it a case of maladministration or criminal activity, such as keeping stamps that they should not have kept&mdash;they would hardly put an ad in the paper, telling everyone about it. So in good faith, their colleagues come to their defence and say that the allegations are unsubstantiated. That is the foam over the substance of the matter&mdash;the froth and bubble in this chamber&mdash;but the bottom line is that the question is entitled to be asked and we can only hope that the answers will be given eventually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I am pleased that you have said that your statement was not delivered on anyone's instructions. As I said earlier, it is a very sad thing for you that, because of its placement, it very much looked that way at the time. I accept that you feel entitled to have done so at question time but perhaps it would have been better if it had been done after question time. I think everyone would agree with that. I make the point that it might have been better to do as a number of previous Presidents have done when they have been concerned about matters, and that is to distribute a letter to all senators, raising the specific point and indicating that if a particular standing order is stretched any further in the chamber, action will be taken in the chamber. At least that puts everyone on notice as to your views in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, you also indicated that there were two other occasions where the Chair&mdash;I think you used that term&mdash;had chosen to make such an intervention. I am wondering whether, when you have a moment to draw our attention to your longstanding interest in this matter&mdash;that is, the occasions on which you have raised it in the Senate and have written to any previous President about it&mdash;you will also give us an indication of when these two previous occasions occurred. Did they occur in question time? If so, was that when question time was being televised? Was the action taken by the President or someone acting as chairman of a committee? Did it follow a statement in the Senate that could possibly be taken to be a statement to which the President was responding, as happened in your case? I think it is important to clarify that because, as you said, yours was a prepared intervention and that is what worries me because it indicates you had given consideration to making it at an appropriate time. That is another matter. You have indicated that it may have been better to make it at a later time and I agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I turn to the matter of the contribution made by Senator Gareth Evans. I have already made my point about the stupid business he goes on with: people not asking questions until they know the answer, and not making allegations until they can substantiate them. It seems we have to know all the facts before we can ask anything about the facts. That is completely ludicrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for standards in this place, I welcome the honourable senator's indication that we all have some responsibility towards maintaining the highest standards of integrity possible in this place. His remarks, however, seemed a little hollow when, time after time, we see our policies misrepresented, especially on broadcast days, and when any complaint is made about it the throwaway line from those on the other side is, `That is a debating point'. Somehow, when the misrepresentation is made by the other side it is called a debating point but when a genuine question is asked on this side it is described as a false allegation designed to denigrate the Senate. It seems somewhat inappropriate that those opposite should take that attitude.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would only hope that Senator Evans would express the same desire for standards in electoral campaigns because the lies and deceits perpetrated by those on the other side&mdash;or, rather, by the people in charge of their campaigns, with whom they simply go along&mdash;do nothing to alter perceptions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice Senator Ray laughingly offering his handkerchief. As he said before, `Here they are again, the tears, because you lot lost'. It was sad that we lost, but one of the factors occasioning the loss was the gross misrepresentation of our policies by those on the other side. Mr President, you would well know that when the community is making its assessment of the standards of parliamentary behaviour it is not restricted to the behaviour it witnesses in this place. Very few people in the community see as much as they should see because we cannot maximise the television broadcast. With our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the opportunity will probably be even further limited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standards by which the community judges us are not only those that apply to the behaviour they see and hear in this place but also those that apply to what they see and hear on the news services at night, during campaigns and out on the streets. Senator Evans says that he would like to see higher standards in this place but he does not seem to realise that members of the House of Representatives and senators should conduct themselves in a manner befitting the highest standards not only in this place but in the electorate as well. </PARA>

At the same time, it is difficult to see what more you could do than you have already done. What concerns me is that if the debate runs on more than it has, clearly, it might be interpreted by those listening that those on the other side have not accepted what you have said and want to, as it were, use this occasion to go on about matters which may or may not be to their political advantage. That would be an unfortunate situation, not only for the chamber but for their standing. On the other side there are people who have most generous hearts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The contributions made by Senator Cooney, to my mind, for the most part always lift the standard of debate in this parliament. Some of the points made by him were most useful. I would like to assure him that I certainly accepted the comments by the President. Within the culture of this place the President recognised that he had taken an action which was perhaps liable to misinterpretation, or for there to be a particular spin put on what he did. The President stood up today and tried to clarify the matter. I certainly welcome that statement. As far as it goes, it helps lay to rest at least some of the concerns on this side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I say, `lays to rest some of the concerns'. You would understand that the reaction on this side of the chamber was generated because of awareness about the behaviour of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), his strong views about the Senate, and the attacks that he makes on it from time to time. Allied with it is the extreme sensitivity of the Prime Minister when issues relating to his piggery investments are raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known that many journalists have received abusive phone calls from the Prime Minister when they have written stories regarding the piggery. On one notable occasion the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, not being part of the culture here in Parliament House, decided to give a full transcript of the nature of the conversation he had with Mr Keating regarding the piggery. That was a front-page story. It revealed to people the sort of bullying which the Prime Minister resorts to when he feels people are questioning possible conflicts of interest regarding his very substantial interests in this piggery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are those two reasons, Mr President. The attitude of the Prime Minister to the Senate is appalling. I hope, as you have now assumed this high office, you will see it as your role to defend this chamber. We are going to have a very difficult year.

There is nothing that you have said, Mr President, that leads me to feel that you do not see your role in that light.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was concerned a year or so ago when the Prime Minister referred to senators in very derogatory terms. The person who formerly occupied the chair found it difficult to respond. I hope that, if you are faced with that challenge, you will not find it difficult to respond. The public are looking to people like yourself, as the President, and the Speaker&mdash;the two most senior people in this parliament&mdash;to uphold the standards of this parliament and, if need be, to defend it. Equally, if you feel that behaviour is not appropriate, you should give us your views. That is why there is the sensitivity on this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the Prime Minister has been very lax in his  personal affairs previously. People will recall the problems with Mr Keating's tax returns and travel allowances. He has built up a record of laxity in relation to his personal affairs, particularly his financial affairs. Mr President, because you allowed the debate to travel far and wide, the comments made by Senator Evans were very interesting. He has very dramatically confirmed that the accounts show there is a very substantial debt from the companies in which Mr Keating has a 50 per cent interest, to Mr Brown, which apparently only has to be repaid at the discretion of the directors. I had not heard it put as clearly before, certainly by someone on the government side. The question is: what is the nature of the agreement that has been made? We would like to see the documents. I think Senator Evans made a further concession in the debate today&mdash;and Senator Baume has pursued this matter, quite rightly, in my view&mdash;which confirms the sort of problem that Senator Baume is raising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, as I said, I accept your statement in the spirit in which it was offered. But I ask you to indicate to the chamber whether Mr Keating at any time has spoken to you about the sort of action he feels should be taken in relation to questions in the Senate regarding his piggery.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ian Macdonald this day, relating to superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>Local government throughout Australia is a very important part of our democratic system. It is the third tier of government in Australia. It is a sphere of government which carries out very important duties which affect all of us, particularly in a more local way in our daily lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the matters that very much concerns me and concerns the peak bodies of local government is that some action has been taken by the government in recent years that has effectively prevented self-employed people from offering themselves for election in that very important third tier of government. The government's superannuation guarantee legislation penalises self-employed people who have their own superannuation and who, like everyone else in Australia, would normally be able to get a tax deduction for that. But, in certain instances, because of the government's superannuation guarantee legislation, councils now have to pay the superannuation guarantee charge&mdash;in many instances only a small amount is being paid&mdash;in relation to elected councillors. That is okay; there is no problem with that. But there is a problem in that the present legislation effectively prevents those councillors from claiming a tax deduction for their own contributions to private self-employed superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This can mean a very severe financial impediment for self-employed people in local government. It is a matter that peak bodies recognised two years or more ago when this legislation was introduced. As a result of that, they petitioned the government and said, `Look, this is being very unfair to people who are elected to local government positions'. The government looked at this and, because it was in the run-up to an election, the previous minister, Mr Simmons&mdash;a former local government person himself; I think he was mayor of his local council&mdash;came out with a commitment. He promised that the government would do something about this; that it would fix the superannuation guarantee legislation so that it did not penalise self-employed people by making it very difficult for them to stand for local government positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Mr Simmons was sincere when he made that promise. But, in retrospect, it is pretty obvious that the thoughts he was enumerating had been given to him by some people who did not ever intend to put those promises into effect. It is now almost two years since Mr Simmons promised in writing that the government would fix that matter, and nothing has been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have asked several questions on the matter. I have continually brought it to the attention of the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services (Mr Howe). The Australian Local Government Association has also done so. Because people send me copies of letters, I am aware of the constant stream of correspondence from local authorities right around Australia to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and to the local government minister asking for that matter to be attended to because the situation is grossly unfair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, two years after the event, nothing has been done. In September last year Senator Richardson answered a question in this chamber and, after getting advice from the minister, said to me that the minister was looking into it, he had referred it to the Treasurer and we would be getting some advice. That was September last year, and there has been nothing since. A couple of weeks later he told the Australian Local Government Association conference the same thing, but still there is nothing. We were told today by Senator Richardson that it is being looked at and something might come up by June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Queensland local government elections are to be held on 26 March. That will effectively interfere with the right of many people in Queensland to stand for election to that important tier of government because they will be severely financially penalised for so doing. It is a disgraceful situation and one that this government, in spite of its promises and its firm, written commitments two years ago, still has not honoured. That is why I asked in question time: is this a ploy on the part of the Labor Party to save its members facing defeat at local government elections in Queensland, or is it simply another lie in the long list of Labor lies that preceded this election?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Coulter this day, relating to the environmental impact of economic growth.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that the question was in three parts and related to the remarks by Dr Adrienne Clarke, the head of CSIRO, that the major environmental problem facing the world today was one of population increase. She had specifically said that that extended to questions of greenhouse, ozone depletion, water pollution and soil erosion and she listed a number of other damaging events. Secondly, my question referred to Dr Marc Latham, the Director-General of the International Board for Soil Research and Management, dealing with such questions as agriculture and soil erosion. He has also and specifically drawn attention to the rapid increase in many of the environmental factors affecting soil and water throughout Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of the question was in the third part, in which I asked Senator Evans how he reconciled this alternative environmental analysis of Asia with the conventional economists' analysis&mdash;the gung-ho analysis that we had in the Garnaut report and have seen more recently in other reports&mdash;that Asia was going to be the booming development area in the world and Australia should hitch its wagon to Asia because that is where the future lies. I found his answer totally unsatisfactory in that he came out with the conventional view that, as the economies of Asia grow, they will then be able to address their environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans is ignoring totally the fact that the environmental problems that I listed in the first part of the question are most severe in those parts of the world which are richest. I point to our own situation where, in terms of purchasing power, the per capita GDP in Australia is one of the highest in the world, yet we are the second worst country in the world in terms of greenhouse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those of us in the environment movement raise the issue of greenhouse, what we should be doing about it, and how we should be spending money in addressing this problem of greenhouse, we are told that we cannot afford it. In the news this morning we heard that scientists at the AAAS meeting in America were suggesting the injection of millions of tonnes of sulfur into the stratosphere as a cheaper way of solving the problem than addressing directly the problem of the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere because the rich nations of the world that are responsible for this problem simply cannot afford to address it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has totally ignored the evidence which shows that on a per capita basis the environmental problems are worst in the developed world, not in the underdeveloped world. The question still stands and remains unanswered: how is it that Asia, with a burgeoning population increase, will be able to sustain the sorts of economic development which are predicted for it, and is it wise for Australia to hitch its wagon to a series of economies which, for environmental reasons, many of us believe will fall flat on their faces? If Senator Evans reads these remarks, I would like him to review the real evidence in relation to the ability of rich nations to address their environmental problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not only the problems I have outlined in relation to greenhouse but also problems in relation to ozone. We are the world's worst polluters when it comes to ozone depletion. Our water pollution has been mentioned in recent days by the Sydney Water Board. Every ocean beach around Australia in proximity to a capital city is seriously polluted. We are told repeatedly by this government&mdash;and we will be told again during the budget sessions that we are just about to go into&mdash;that we cannot afford, as a rich nation, to address those problems. How is it then that Asian nations, where these problems are even worse, are going to be able to address them? The question is: is it wise for us to hitch our economic and social future to the nations of Asia? I would certainly argue, and I think many people coming from the environment side would argue, that it is most unwise for us to go down that path. I would like Senator Evans to reconsider his answer to my question today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What has come from the question asked by Senator Coulter is the fact that much of the environmental damage is not caused by population growth at all; it is caused by rich countries, many of which have quite sparse populations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. It is not what economic rationalism is about at all; that is exactly right. The point I am making is that it is really unfair to blame population growth, as the CSIRO has done. This is not the time to debate this at length, in a motion to take note of an answer given by Senator Evans, but I do flag that we should look at these things with a great deal more perception than simply jumping on the population control bandwagon. I attended an inter-parliamentary global conference on the environment in Washington on 2 May 1990. I pitched my tent in Green Belt National Park. I was appalled that the well-heeled in the population control bureaucracies were staying at their five star, energy guzzling hotels and belly aching that there were too many Africans and Asians in the world and that they had to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Earlier, I asked Senator Crowley about the absence of a Tasmanian woman on the Australian Council for Women. How can we have an Australian Council for Women that does not include representatives from Tasmania or the Northern Territory?</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to get into an argument across the chamber with Senator Collins. Senator Crowley made the point in her answer that the council was put together on the basis of its expertise. She mentioned the word expertise more than once&mdash;she said it was a great council and that the expertise was there. By inference, it would appear on the surface that the expertise for membership of the Australian Council for Women does not exist in Tasmania or the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sat and thought about that. I looked back at some of the famous women from Tasmania that I can recall. Looking at the field of politics, there is none more famous than Dame Enid Lyons, through to former Senator Shirley Walters. Looking at the state parliament, we have Sue Napier MHA, the first woman appointed to state cabinet. The opposition has Fran Bladel and Judy Jackson, who have been most vocal about women's affairs in Tasmania. I refer also to the Tasmanian director of health and nursing, Gillian Biscoe, who is a former director of nursing here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the sporting side, Tasmania has had famous sportswomen such as Lindy Goggin, Australian women's amateur golf champion, and Julie Kent an Olympic diver. Anna Brown, a student of the Friends' School in Hobart, was recently a gold medallist in the world education championships for biology. The Lord Mayor of Hobart, Doone Kennedy, is the most senior mayor in Australia. So there is plenty of expertise among Tasmanian women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in Senator Crowley's answer, I was taken aback when she said, `It is all right because when we have our initial meeting in Hobart we will co-opt a Tasmanian'. What a slap in the face for Tasmanian women! Senator Crowley is saying, `Because we are having the meeting in your state and you do not have a representative on that particular council, we will co-opt one for the meeting'. Wonderful! Why can Tasmania and the Northern Territory not have a permanent full representative on that particular council? One of the biggest concerns expressed to me by a lot of people is the fact that people in isolated and rural areas are not represented. That was the whole point I was making in the question. I do not think Senator Crowley was on top of this particular question at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, I noticed today in the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS>, a southern Tasmanian newspaper, that the Tasmanian government has appointed its third Tasmanian womens' consultative council with 12 members. Obviously the Tasmanian government is more concerned about womens' matters than is the federal government. That council will deal with the environment, sex discrimination and the like, with representatives from right around Tasmania&mdash;a non-parochial council reporting on womens' affairs in my own state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very disappointed with the answer. I hope that Minister Crowley has words with Mrs Kelly and puts it to her that this co-opted member for the initial conference in Tasmania, whoever she may be, becomes a full member of the Australian Council for Women, and that the government consider appointing a representative from the Northern Territory to make this a truly representative Australian women's consultative council. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the statement and the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> was approved by government earlier this month. It is the latest in a series of published documents in which the government has presented and explained the development of Australia's defence and strategic policies over the past decade. But this document is the first major step in the adaptation of our defence and strategic policies to the major changes now under way in the regional and global security environment following the end of the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> looks ahead three to five years to assess the consequences of Australia's security of key strategic developments now under way globally and regionally, and it proposes policy approaches to meet those challenges over the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the first part of a two-stage process. The second part is a white paper, which is now being prepared for government consideration. We expect that it will be published later this year. It will look further ahead into the next century and set long-term approaches to maintaining our security and managing our defence resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the past ten years Australia's defence forces have been developed to meet regional contingencies, not to fight the Cold War. But the end of the Cold War has set in train long-term processes which will profoundly change our regional strategic circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to start adapting now to these emerging trends. Predictability in security matters has declined. Relationships are now more complex, fluid and uncertain. These are not necessarily unfavourable, but they do place new challenges on defence policy-making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the fundamentals of regional security are reflected in two major trends. The first of these, flowing directly from the end of the Cold War, is the evolving role of outside powers in regional security affairs, and especially the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">America's continued engagement in the Asia-Pacific region is not in question. Despite big cuts, America will for the foreseeable future remain the strongest military power in the world by a wide margin. And America will retain strong interests in the stability and security of the Asia-Pacific region. Those interests will remain fundamentally aligned not just with Australia's interest, but with those of the region as a whole. Therefore, we are confident that America will remain strategically engaged in the Asia-Pacific region, making a very important contribution to maintaining peace and stability in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is clear that Americans do not see it as appropriate for them to shoulder alone the responsibility for guaranteeing Asia's security. They will support regional security initiatives, while maintaining their bilateral relationships.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly over coming years regional countries, including Australia and our Asian neighbours, will need to take responsibility themselves for the basic elements of security in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second major trend in regional security is the extraordinary economic growth in the region itself. Over the next ten years, the strategic potential of the nations of the Asia-Pacific will increase significantly as their economies continue to grow and diversify. Their actual military capabilities are likely to increase, with many new capabilities already being introduced. So by early next century the strategic potential and military capacities of the nations of Asia are likely to be substantially increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These trends do not mean that our region is necessarily becoming less secure. On the contrary, the Asia-Pacific region today is stable, prosperous and dynamic. With a few exceptions, the countries of our region show strong economic growth, stable and effective government, and a commitment to peace, stability and freer trade. We have seen that commitment reflected in the development of institutions like APEC and the ASEAN Regional Forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, some serious problems remain, particularly on the Korean peninsula, and also for example in the South China Sea. But the collapse of superpower rivalry has eased many tensions in the region, and effective cooperation has helped to resolve longstanding problems like Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have good reason to be confident about the security of our region. But we cannot be complacent. The fundamental conditions which support Asia-Pacific security are changing, slowly but in important ways. Security in the Asia-Pacific region will ultimately depend on the maintenance of a new and more complex set of interrelationships between the nations of the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clear message of this review is that Australia's security&mdash;like its economic future&mdash;lies in and with our region. This means we must be a participant, not an onlooker, in regional security and other areas. We must pursue our national interest, through engaging with our region. The challenge for all the nations of the region is to expand their strategic engagement alongside each nation's commitment to its own national defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These developments have important ramifications for Australia's strategic policies which are set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS>. I will deal with these first in summary, then in more detail. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review</EMPHASIS> confirms that the central focus of defence policy should be our capacity for national defence. This will continue to be pursued through a policy of defence self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people expect that Australia should be able to defend itself, and it is a fundamental requirement of a responsible government to ensure that the nation has this capability. The forces developed for the defence of Australia will also be able to contribute to global and regional activities consistent with our national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, a dominant theme of our defence policy will be increasing defence engagement with the region, with a growing focus particularly on South-East Asia. Our alliance with the United States also remains important both for the way it enhances our capacity for national defence and for its contribution to regional security. We will continue to pursue alliance activities which sustain these mutually reinforcing priorities. Finally, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review</EMPHASIS> concludes that we must continue to support efforts to promote effective global security mechanisms, especially through the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the opening theme of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS>&mdash;national defence.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that at the core of our ability to contribute to those key activities I have just outlined is the maintenance of a highly competent Defence Force equipped with advanced technology and structured for Australia's unique geo-strategic environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Defence Force of today is shaped by the rigorous application of planning principles enunciated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS>. The most important of these principles is that we must be confident of being able to deal in a timely way with circumstances in the future.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, our capability to defend our own territory is central to our standing in the region and to the role we can play as a partner in regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our strategy for the defence of Australia remains one of defence in depth. This strategy, and our force structure planning, give priority to presenting any adversary with a comprehensive array of military capabilities capable of independent defensive and offensive operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Emphasis, therefore, is given to clearly-focused intelligence and surveillance operations, to strong maritime and air defence capabilities, and to highly mobile and capable land forces which can deal with hostilities quickly on our own terms. The capabilities for these roles determine the ADF's overall force structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To optimise our force structure, the development of the ADF will give a particular emphasis to the key principles of joint operations, the promotion of competence and professionalism, the selective application of advanced technology and a rigorous approach to preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major expansion of force projection capabilities by other nations for direct attack would require long lead-times which would be clearly evident to us. Our intelligence monitoring and analysis plays a key role in assessing warning time for major conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A commitment to the defence of Australia includes a commitment to the industrial strength of this nation. The development of our defence science and industry are important elements of our self-reliant defence capability. Without support from defence science and industry, the sustainability of our combat support capabilities would be quickly eroded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is committed to developing, in Australian industry, an ability to support and maintain Defence Force equipment and, where appropriate, to produce it in Australia. The close relationship between defence industry and defence science will be an important factor in our ability to deliver the technological advances demanded by our defence requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of this Government's support for local industry, Defence is now better able to draw on Australian industry. This is reflected in the considerable increase in local content for defence systems and equipment, from 30 per cent a decade ago, to 65 per cent today. Defence depends heavily on Australian industry for the provision of goods and services. Local shipbuilding and electronics industries are playing a major role in the delivery of many of our major defence platforms such as submarines and frigates. Defence is also looking towards industry to provide maintenance and support of equipment and, through the commercial support program, to provide a range of support services such as catering and base support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the next theme of this review, namely regional engagement. The recognition that our future security lies with our region, not against it, provides us with significant opportunities to enhance our national interests by contributing to regional security and enmeshing ourselves in this economically dynamic region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We intend to expand and accelerate our strategic engagement with our nearer region alongside our primary commitment to developing our self-reliant capacity for the defence of Australia. We are establishing closer relations with nations of the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;especially our neighbours in South-East Asia&mdash;across all aspects of national endeavour. The enhancement of these relationships will greatly strengthen our security. Their proximity is a factor in our security and their position as major trading partners contributes to our national well-being. Australia in turn has much to contribute to regional security and the capabilities we have developed for our self-reliant defence will help support peace and stability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the preparation of this review, we undertook an unprecedented series of consultations with the countries of our nearer region. It was important that we understood regional views and perspectives, and that our thinking was understood and appreciated by our neighbours as a positive contribution to our mutual security goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same approach was taken with our alliance partners. This forward-looking, open approach is a touchstone of defence thinking under this Government. It has paid significant dividends in our developing relationships with our region.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that Australia is better prepared than many other countries to face the realities of the post-Cold War world of today, a world that is more regionally focused than before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, the Asia-Pacific region has been changing rapidly in line with the aspirations of individual nations. Australia, as an active member of this region, must make the necessary adjustments to keep pace. In South-East Asia, we are developing defence relationships based on the concept of strategic partnership. We have long stressed the need for Australia to strengthen its linkages with its neighbours and comprehensively engage with the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We aim now to move beyond the framework of existing cooperative activities to consider new opportunities, including for shared training, defence science and industry cooperation and procurement. This will increase our understanding of regional defence developments and encourage effective and responsible planning for self-reliance that will add to the strategic strength of the region as a whole. Clearly, the particular nature of our partnerships which develop will vary from country to country over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our relationship with Indonesia remains central to regional engagement. Priority will be given to the development of personal and professional relationships amongst senior officers on both sides, combined exercises, personnel exchanges, training and other activities which foster long-term mutual understanding at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five-power defence arrangements will remain relevant to our defence policy objectives of promoting regional security and are an important element in Australia's national engagement with our nearer region. Through the Malaysia-Australia joint defence program and defence science and industry working group, we have a well-established and mutually beneficial defence relationship with Malaysia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Singapore, the relationship has broadened substantially to include access to our training areas such as the Delamere Air Weapons Range and Shoalwater Bay and to the collocation of Singapore Air Force personnel and 30 aircraft with existing Australian RAAF personnel at Pearce in Western Australia. This agreement, totally funded by the Singapore government, is a valuable extension of Australia's defence links with Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These increasing defence force and defence industry links with regional nations are an important indicator of the growing sense of regional strategic community. It serves our interests and those of regional countries to pursue the development of such links. Such activities represent the type of openness that is one of the building blocks of regional stability and security. More broadly, the Association of South East Asian Nations will be central to efforts by regional countries to achieve workable and common approaches on regional security issues. The establishment last July of the ASEAN Regional Forum was an important step in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With New Zealand we will seek to maintain a strong defence relationship based on the longstanding commitment of each nation to the security of the other. Our efforts to promote our shared defence interests and commitments will be based on our program of closer defence relations and the coordination of our policies throughout the region. We will also maintain strategic commitment to Papua New Guinea and other south west Pacific states with a focus on cooperation, which assists in promoting national resilience and increases the capacity of these nations to deal with security problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further afield, the increasing power and influence of the major Asian powers such as Japan, the People's Republic of China and India, require Australia to develop constructive contact with these countries in the security field. In particular, we need to understand their interests and gain their understanding of Australia's objectives in enhancing regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of a US strategic role in the Asia-Pacific region remains a critical element for the security of Australia and our region. Our alliance relationship with the United States is the next key theme of the review, with an emphasis on its importance in the context of a shared commitment to security in the Asia-Pacific region. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's defence relationship with the United States helps maintain US strategic links with this part of the world and thereby contributes to regional stability. It is also of enduring significance for our national strategic posture. Our alliance with the United States continues to be an important factor in the development of Australia's defence capabilities. Both countries acknowledge the continuing importance of our security cooperation under the ANZUS treaty, including the continuing relevance and the value of mutual security obligations embodied in the treaty, and our close consultation on issues of mutual security concern. The nature of the relationship continues to evolve, as it has over the past five decades, but it has grown even stronger. This is a reflection of the depth of our shared values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Australian industry is increasing its ability to support the Australian Defence Force, a number of weapons platforms and technologies in our defence inventory are purchased from and supported by the United States. We could not afford to produce such systems locally. The joint defence facilities and our intelligence relationship with the United States remain valuable factors in our security and they continue to make a major contribution to global and regional security. Australia's defence science activities benefit strongly from cooperation with the United States, both bilaterally and through the technical cooperation program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final theme of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> concerns our support for the United Nations and wider national efforts to promote mechanisms that contain the spread of weapons of mass destruction. An Australian contribution to international efforts to keep or restore peace is consistent with our interests. Our participation in peace support operations is a tangible demonstration of our commitment to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts, one of our major foreign policy goals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When peace support operations occur within our own region, Australian involvement also reinforces our position as a participant in and a contributor to regional security, which is one of our major defence goals. Working together with regional states on peacekeeping operations, for example, in Cambodia adds to a sense of regional security and reinforces our capability to act together in other situations if needed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are limits to the amount of peacekeeping to which we can commit. Our level of contribution should not blind us to one basic point: such activities are supplementary to the central role of the Australian Defence Force in the direct defence of Australia and its interests and the promotion of those interests within our neighbourhood. Each request we receive for our participation in a peace support operation must, therefore, be considered on its own merits and with a very clear understanding of its implications for our national interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a word about resources. In recent years, Defence has made highly innovative and successful reforms to maximise efficiencies and maintain investment and capabilities broadly in line with our long-term defence policy, despite significant reductions in financial guidance. These efforts will continue and intensify, but the maintenance of a self-reliant defence capability that can protect Australia, contribute to the security of our wider region and support the United Nations will require continued commitment by the Commonwealth and the people of Australia to adequate sustained defence funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> is the first comprehensive post-Cold War assessment of Australia's strategic outlook. Work has now begun on the Defence white paper to be released later this year. It will take account of the key assessments and the broad policy framework in the strategic review and, from these, develop detailed planning guidance for Defence for the first decade of the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will review and, if necessary, revise our basic planning concepts to ensure that they fit our evolving strategic environment and provide planning guidance on force structure development, management of regional and alliance relationships, and industry, science and personnel policy. This strategic review and the white paper which will follow will build on the defence policy developed by this government over the past decade to provide a clear and rigorous basis for Australia's defence policy into the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) for presenting his ministerial statement, even though it is probably a few months late. There is no more important obligation on a government than the security of its people and their freedom from aggression from other nations. It is, quite simply, the first and most important duty of a national government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, in the 11 years of this Labor government we have seen a policy of keeping debate on defence out of the parliament and as low key as possible. We have also seen a policy of progressively reducing the defence budget. There has been a marked decline in Australia's defence capability in the 11 years that the Labor Party has been in government. I accept at the outset that it is difficult, but I certainly do not accept that it is impossible, to maintain an interest in funding defence forces in a democracy in a peacetime state. But the lessons of history are that wars are a recurrent, tragic event for the human race. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We never know when we will need a defence force. If we have a good defence force, the chances of having to use it are considerably less than if we have no defence force or an inadequate defence force. The other basic fundamental about a defence force is that we cannot fund it in good years when we have a good season, a good wool clip, good beef prices or something like that and then not fund it when times are hard. We have to maintain a basic level of constant expenditure so that we maintain capability and expertise within that defence force. It is an ongoing commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now nearly 50 years since the end of World War II. That means that the time of stress placed on the nation, when its national security was challenged, is beyond the memory of most Australians who are alive today. The ending of the Cold War a couple of years ago also contributed to a run-down in interest and willingness to support defence measures. The emergence of the United Nations, both in its peacekeeping and peace enforcement roles, has conveyed some false aspects to the maintenance of international security. I am very pleased that we have not had any world wars for 50 years. I am very pleased to see the end of the Cold War, which was a highly dangerous state for all of us. I am very pleased to see an expansion of the United Nations into peacekeeping and other roles to maintain international security. But that is not the end of the matter by any means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about here is national security, and in that there can be no mistakes. We are playing for the highest of all stakes with respect to our own security. If we get it wrong and we do not protect the country in the way we should, then tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of young lives will be lost, and lost pointlessly. We will have many careers broken. We will have enormous disruptions to the community and an enormous economic debt. Of course, in the worst possible case, we could lose the country. So this really is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the practice of all Australian governments, probably since the end of the Second World War, to make appreciations, in the military sense, of what might be the security situation that faces Australia. These appreciations are done every three to five years and, up to 1990, they have always been regarded as confidential documents. In 1990 the Labor government released a publication called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's strategic planning in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, which was the first release ever&mdash;of what used to be called a strategic basis paper&mdash;for the general public. I support the government in its activities to add to the debate on security matters by doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with these strategic planning papers is that, first of all, they are sanitised. We do not know what has been left out. This paper is in exactly the same category as the one that preceded it in 1990. The other great difficulty is that they lead to white papers, which more precisely define the threat and, therefore, the force structure and capabilities that are needed to counter that threat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not given to anyone, least of all the senior people in the Department of Defence, to accurately foresee the future. While it is prudent and commonsense to make an appreciation of what might happen, the difficulties are that when those predictions become prescriptive, they become enshrined as fact as to what is going to happen and the force structure of the Defence Force is designed about them. Sadly, that is what tends to be done instead of taking them as a guide, like the Queensland railways timetable, of what might happen. As I said before, it is not given to any of us to forecast the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first paper to be released, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's strategic planning in the 1990s</EMPHASIS>, was a sanitised document. It virtually validated what the government had been doing up to the time. It maintained the status quo. Page 3 of that report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the end of the Cold War that has prompted the government to release this declassified version. ASP 90 shows that the broad thrust of Australia's security approach remains appropriate despite the major global changes we have seen.</PARA>
<PARA>There is not terribly much difference between the paper tabled today and ASP `90, except that it rejects the assertion that despite the end of the Cold War there have been no changes. Sadly, the document before us today is twice the size; it is 75 pages. While I have made only a quick review of it, I have a feeling of disappointment about it. It mentions, as a central part of its claims, the fact that the end of the Cold War creates a different environment for Australia. That is perfectly true. But it then does not go on to forecast in any detail at all what those changes might be that affect the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems we face in dealing with a paper such  as this&mdash;after all, this is a booklet of 75 pages&mdash;is reviewing it in the time that we have before it comes into the chamber. I would like to thank Senator Robert Ray, the Minister for Defence, for his generosity in making the paper available to me before the normal one hour before tabling time. It was made available to me a bit after 12.00 p.m. today, but even so it is a very short period to go through what is a really major statement, read the minister's 20-minute tabling speech as well and organise my views on it. The sad point is that if we do not tackle it at the time of tabling, we will not get a chance in the Senate to come back to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a great deal of repetition in this document. It does not really advance the sum of public knowledge at all. Without being unkind to it, I do not think there is an original thought in it. All that is in it about the changed circumstances, the government could have learned had it listened to what I have been saying for years and what all the members of the opposition have been saying&mdash;that is, the ending of the Cold War has had significant changes on Australia's security considerations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have moved from a bipolar world to a multipolar world. We have moved from a world where global issues predominated to a world where regional or national issues predominate. We have moved from superpower defence, where we could shelter with the Americans and the NATO countries, to a period of self-defence. We have moved from some degree of certainty of our defence threats to an area of uncertainty and unpredictability. It is not only the uncertainty of what might happen in foreign relations in the region, our relations with other countries, but also we have a great deal of uncertainty now as to who our allies would be in any sort of military conflict. That becomes very important with respect to logistic support, munitions, equipment and things that we would need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, I have the impression, reading this book, that there is a very strong influence of Foreign Affairs on the Department of Defence. While I have the greatest of respect for the Department of Foreign Affairs, it really has a limited place in defence planning and defence analysis, particularly when it gets into the field of intelligence gathering, which Foreign Affairs prides itself on. The only thing that I would say to the department is that from Fiji to the Falklands it got it wrong. While there is a place for consultation around the cocktail circuits and the embassies of the world, the business of defence is the business of the defence department. I can see many fingerprints on this document of current thinking in the Department of Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> comes up with no specific requirements that have to be met for the defence of Australia. The minister presented a good speech for 20 minutes and I do not propose to debate that speech here. I think the essence of what we are talking about this afternoon is in the paper itself. I propose to move through the paper. The introductory statement is good. In the preface it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defence of Australia is not just an activity of Government. It requires the understanding, involvement and support of the Australian people.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fundamental truth. That is something that the government should actively work at&mdash;to educate people that defence is not the responsibility alone of the people in uniform in Australia; it is something that involves all of us. We all have a part to play in it. In the introduction there is again a general statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's security derives from a combination of factors, including the maintenance of a highly competent defence force equipped with advanced technology and structured for Australia's unique geostrategic environment, growing involvement in a widening range of cooperative arrangements with Asian neighbours, and our active support for global security and international alliances.</PARA>
<PARA>That is true. The next sentence says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force (ADF) of today is shaped by a rigorous application of planning principles enunciated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia 1987</EMPHASIS> White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA>I mentioned before the difficulties that arise&mdash;the lack of flexibility and balance&mdash;when white papers prescribe what will happen in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 1 is a reasonable review of Australia's strategic outlook. There is some comment about the United Nations in paragraph 1.10 to the effect that it is to be supported and encouraged to fulfil its fundamental role, which is the maintenance of secure international relations around the world. However, it must be recognised that there are limitations on what the United Nations can do. For example, there are difficulties when a shooting war starts, particularly within a country. We have all witnessed the impotence of the United Nations to effectively control what is going on today in the former Yugoslavia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point in this chapter refers to United States strategic defence policy and transitions and the very major defence force reductions taking place. The certainty of those reductions, which is not mentioned in this report, is that the Americans will make a mess of them. They always get force reductions wrong; that is the lesson of history. They will probably cut too deeply and inappropriately and that will lead to increased security tensions around the world. Conversely, when expansion is required the Americans always get it right&mdash;they get it right brilliantly. They have produced miracles when it comes to force expansion, but when it comes to force reduction, unfortunately, history is against them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other difficulty with the American position in the Pacific at the present time is the great conflict of interest over commercial activities in Japan. No-one knows where that will end up but the certainty is that the Americans will be looking for allies. If we have some military difficulty with another Pacific nation, there is no way that we can make a confident prediction that the Americans will support us under ANZUS. It is possible that America will give preference to its commercial interests and support a country with interests at variance with our own. After all, when our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was in Japan last year he said that Australia would support Japan against the United States in any commercial conflict arising out of trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chapter goes on to talk about North-East Asia. In particular, it deals with the Korean peninsula, an area of serious concern since it is the world's pre-eminent military flashpoint. The situation there shows the limitations of arms control agreements. I have been a great supporter of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, as has this parliament, but the defiance of the provisions of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty by the North Koreans demonstrates that at the end of the day these agreements have their limitations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South-East Asia is an area of great economic growth, but growth is uneven between the nations. History shows us that when economic growth takes place and economic competition is paramount, that often leads to some degree of military competition and, at times, friction. While the economic growth of South-East Asia is to be applauded for a variety of reasons, that is no guarantee of peace eternal in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chapter also deals with the South-West Pacific area. It does not say too much because there is not much the government can say about its activities in the South-West Pacific area. It and Papua New Guinea have been the great black hole, the area of neglect, in our foreign policy over the last 11 years. Similarly, the chapter on New Zealand is also very weak. The New Zealanders simply are not pulling their weight. Recently, the foreign minister of Australia went to New Zealand and told them to pull up their socks and do something about it; they just yawned. This is a country that spends 1.4 per cent of a minuscule GDP on defence, so in real terms, that expenditure is very low. It is really only a token. I remind the Senate that it was New Zealand that broke the ANZUS agreement, and the consequence of that was increased costs for our defence forces, which are already tightly strapped for money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government has taken the view that if it does not cosset the New Zealand government and put up with its unreal views on world affairs&mdash;particularly with regard to its own security&mdash;New Zealand will get right out of having a defence force. They believe that half a loaf is better than no loaf. My personal view is that, unless New Zealand is prepared to make a contribution proportionally equal to our contribution to security, we should sever any links with them, and that includes commercial agreements such as the CER and the rest. We are flat out paying for our own defence without carrying a weak sister at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 2 deals with the United Nations. One problem is that the United Nations has not set up a military command and control system. It has not planned for anything other than peacekeeping activities. Most of those activities have been successful. Cambodia was a brilliant success. It was a great mistake that the Australian government did not send General Sanderson to New York as our military attache to the UN. While he would have been grossly over-ranked there, he would have gone as a hero&mdash;the victor of Cambodia&mdash;and he would have filled a vacuum that exists in military planning and military expertise, which would have been extremely valuable and would have expanded Australia's influence in the UN. </PARA>

It is a post that certainly does not need to be filled in peacetime.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 3 deals with regional security. That is the standard line that the government is pushing now&mdash;the line the opposition has been pushing for 10 or 15 years. Fifteen years ago I said that our defence and security depended on the defence and security of the region. That is one reason that I attacked the isolationist theme of the Dibb report and why its recommendations were totally untenable. However, the government has now come around to recognising that fact, which is good, even if it is a little late in the day. Of course, militarily, Australia has always enjoyed good relations with the military establishments of all the nations in the regions. In some cases, they are better than our commercial or diplomatic relations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 4 deals with Australia's relationship with the United States. It is a very important chapter because even today ANZUS is absolutely essential to us. It is welcomed by the regional countries. They like Australia being part of ANZUS because they recognise that it is a sort of guarantee of the United States taking an interest in the region. There are also many benefits of ANZUS for Australia. High technology equipment is one. I should say here that Australia is one of the few countries in the world that has always paid top dollar for the equipment it has purchased from the United States. We have never been a party to any military aid program. While we are grateful for the access to this equipment, we have always paid for what we have bought. The other great benefit is our access to American intelligence gathering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deplore the Prime Minister's statement made during his recent visit to the United States that henceforth the basis of the relationship between Australia and the US will be based on commercial interests and not security interests. That is a very false and shallow reading of the relationship between the two countries and one which, in the fullness of time, we will come to regret if anyone tries to implement it in a wholehearted way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chapter 5 deals with Australia's defence posture. It starts with the laudable statement that we have a responsibility to the Australian people to provide for our own defence. I wholeheartedly support that view. On page 41, under the heading `Planning for the defence of Australia', things start to become a little bit fuzzy. Paragraph 5.14 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In circumstances where Australia faces no identifiable military threat, priorities for the development of our defence capabilities are driven principally by Australia's geography, the different forms of conflict to which we would be required to respond, and the timescales in which various levels of pressure which could arise.</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 5.16 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's northern environment also presents potential vulnerabilities that could be exploited by an adversary. The use of limited military force to attack population centres or settlements and other targets around northern Australia, our offshore territories and resource assets, and shipping in proximate areas could pose significant problems for us.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very defeatist statement and sends very much the wrong signals to the region. The simple answer is that we would not sit back and allow Australia's sparsely settled areas to be picked off at will by any marauding armed forces from another country. The facts are that no armed force comes out of the thin air. It comes from a base, and it comes from a base in a country. The message which should be clearly spelt out in our doctrine is that any armed intervention against Australia will be met by an instant retaliation against the base from which that force operates. If that does not stop it, it escalates from then on. There is no other option available to us. If we run around trying to appease people and argue the case in diplomatic circles, we will be exhausted. We cannot maintain our sovereignty on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next part of the chapter deals with warning times and the difference between intention and capability. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Intent alone is an insufficient basis for defence planning, since intentions can change relatively quickly.</PARA>
<PARA>That misses the point altogether about intentions. One can measure capabilities of another country but one can never measure intentions. People or nations that have offensive aims in life do not make their intentions clear. The classical case was Iraq and its invasion of Kuwait. No-one could foresee that. It is quite wrong to claim intentions can change relatively quickly, and miss the major point that they cannot be measured.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chapter also has a section called `Major Conflict'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, Australia has a significant capacity to expand its forces.</PARA>
<PARA>One of the difficulties with all the planning that has gone on in the last 15 or 20 years is that no-one has taken seriously the case that we may be involved in something beyond low-level contingencies. With regard to a major war which might arise&mdash;even though it might be remote&mdash;planning for expansion, which is an essential task of the Department of Defence, simply has not been done. The worst-case scenario, where we might be fighting a major war on our own, is never contemplated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then come to a section entitled `Defence of Australia  Roles'. On page 45 a number of qualities are listed. There is no argument about the topics listed, but the priority in which they are listed does reflect a degree of muddled thinking, because the first one is intelligence collection and evaluation. The second is surveillance of maritime areas and northern Australia. The list then continues as follows: maritime patrol and response; protection of shipping, offshore territories and resources; air defence in maritime areas and northern approaches; defeat of incursions on Australian territory; protection of important civil and defence assets, including infrastructure and population centres; and strategic strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lessons of war as they apply to Australia are best shown up in the Second World War because that was a situation where national security was threatened in a way it never had been before. We had to fight in our own geographic region. It was quite different from fighting in France, North Africa and all the other places that Australian forces have been involved in. The lesson that came out of the Second World War was the pre-eminent role of air power in our environment. It showed flexibility, responsiveness, range, versatility for air superiority, strike, surveillance, transport, adaptability and concentration made air power predominant in our environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter which I believe needs to be considered about air power and its neglect in Australian defence planning is that it is now more socially acceptable to use and develop air power than to be involved in the widespread carnage of the land battlefield, or ships being torpedoed and sinking in blazing fuel oil. Death in any form is to be deplored, and we want to avoid it. It is horrible in any sense. But the social climate of Australia, as I read it, is more prepared to see aircraft used in an offensive role to protect our interests than to see massed armies or navies going to sea to defend our interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technological advances allow precision guided munitions to be used from air platforms, so that the collateral damage to civilians is limited. The aim of all these activities, of course, is to destroy an attacking nation's military potential. If that potential can be precisely destroyed without damaging either the human life or civilian structure of that other country, I think it is a more acceptable way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent years, an imbalance has been created in the Australian Defence Force. We have put a huge amount of money into developing naval capabilities&mdash;the Collins submarines, the Minehunter program, the Anzac ships, to name a few&mdash;which have sucked up all the available capital. We have a huge investment in naval construction, now and in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I leave this chapter I point out that while it talks about what Australia needs to do to plan for its defence, it carries with it the implication we have a clean sheet of paper, which is quite false. We do not have a clean sheet of paper at all. We are the inheritors of the mismanagement and bad policies of the Labor government. I refer particularly to what Mr Beazley did when he was defence minister, with his defence equipment purchases. He has dictated what capabilities the Australian defence forces will possess for the next 30 years. As to the Anzac ship program, not one ship has been launched. We will be running those ships 30 or 35 years down the track because we simply cannot afford to get away from it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chapter about Australia's defence posture should contain something about how we are going to use the capabilities that we have been locked into. Some of those have been as a result of the Cold War philosophy. The Anzac ship is a classic example of buying a capability for the Cold War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many basic shortcomings of the Australian Defence Force, and they are not mentioned in the review. I hope when we get the next chapter in this saga, the white paper, some of the specifics of Australia's defence capabilities will be addressed in more detail than we have here. As I have said, this is a disappointing document. There is nothing new in it. I hope the follow-on white paper is a bit more intellectually developed. I hope it is not a blue paper, meaning written entirely with a view to the United Nations and foreign affairs and peacekeeping forces, but that it really does deal with the nuts and bolts of how we are going to defend this country in the next decade or two.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

We also welcome the review's low-key emphasis and sober analysis of possible military threats from the region, although no doubt some of its more controversial conclusions have been cut to prevent antagonising regional neighbours. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) has acknowledged that taking part in United Nations' operations and regional security cooperation are increasingly important contributors to national security. Subject to important reservations, which I will outline later, the Democrats would agree with that assumption as well.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I would like to place on record our admiration for the very fine contribution that Australian forces have made to peacekeeping operations with the United Nations in recent times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We further support the document's statement that Defence should buy Australian to support self-reliance. It is to the shame of this government that it cannot apply the same philosophy to the defence of our economy. If other ministers and departments showed the same commitment to Australian industry, our unemployment rate and balance of payments would look a great deal better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We disagree with the document in some key respects, which I will now discuss. The document fails to acknowledge that some forms of regional military cooperation, such as training, joint exercises, exports and aid, can undermine security by contributing to human rights abuses. Australian aid to the Papua New Guinea defence force has demonstrably contributed to atrocities on Bougainville during the first Papua New Guinea defence force military campaign against the BRA, and via the blockade which has resulted in many innocent deaths from preventable diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Joint training with Indonesia's special forces links Australia with abuses committed by those forces on Aceh. The effect of human rights abuses is to undermine respect for and confidence in the regime which commits them. This undermines stability and is therefore not in Australia's security interests, even from a conventional viewpoint. The Democrats are not opposed to regional security cooperation, but it should be carefully designed to promote, not detract from, respect for human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section on regional security is fairly sanguine about the pattern of arms purchases in the region, although it identifies some potential for competition to undermine sound strategic judgment and distort force structures. What this ignores is the positive contribution that arms restraint could make to regional security and economic prosperity. This is not about to happen in the near future, but it would be appropriate for Australia to start raising the possibility and focusing regional minds on the benefits of arms restraint. We admit that there are many obstacles to regional arms restraint, not least China's force projection ambitions and the uncertainties surrounding its political evolution, but that is no reason not to start the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The section dealing with national defence acknowledges that Australia faces no identifiable military threat. This has been the case for decades. Elsewhere, the review concludes that the likelihood that economic tensions and divergent growth patterns will spill over into military confrontation is not high. On the other hand there is an acknowledgment that trade in illegal immigrants is growing, becoming more sophisticated and requiring greater resources for its monitoring and prevention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review also spells out the various ways in which Defence provides aid to the community through non-defence activities such as disaster relief. However, I find no mention in the review of environmental threats, yet these are growing rapidly, just as regional military threats are declining. The review maintains the longstanding view that non-defence tasks should not determine the Australian Defence Force's overall force structure. Yet it is becoming less and less likely that the Australian Defence Force will be called upon to defend Australia militarily, given the growing importance of regional and global security institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of this is to suggest that we should not have a national defence system, but the Democrats would ask whether we could better combine military defence with defence against natural disasters, illegal immigration and environmental degradation. For example, the Democrats would ask whether the guided missile frigates will be as useful as a greater number of lighter and faster coastal patrol vessels costing the same amount. I note that Senator MacGibbon made a similar point. There is a widespread view that coastal patrol vessels would have been better able to defend against low-level military incursions while being far more useful for such peacetime tasks as fisheries patrol and the interception of smugglers and illegal immigrants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are strongly of the view that Defence should purchase a fleet of at least six Canadair CL-415 amphibious aircraft. These are brilliant water bombers which are also useful for coastal monitoring and patrol. There is a widely held view that the gallant men and women who fought the New South Wales bushfires deserved far more firebombing support than the helicopters which were provided. If Canadair aircraft are good enough for such diverse countries as France, Greece and Thailand, they are surely worth considering for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review states that Defence needs to maintain close liaison with civil surveillance organisations and explore ways for them to assist in time of conflict. The Democrats would argue that if Defence provided more assistance to civil surveillance as I have just outlined, it would be much better served in times of conflict. It is a sign of the inadequacy of our coastal surveillance systems that a boatload of Chinese refugees can reach the Western Australian coast without being detected, and that a fugitive Malaysian prince and his children can drift for days through Australian waters without being intercepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review concludes by warning that adequate sustained defence funding is needed to ensure that the ADF can protect Australia, contribute to regional security and support the United Nations. The Democrats would ask whether Defence has cut sufficient fat from its own budget. In these days of fiscal stringency it is remarkable that Defence is the only department to escape line-by-line budgetary scrutiny of the Department of Finance and the Expenditure Review Committee. We believe that that must change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has attacked the Democrats for objecting to his attempts to save money by contracting out services at Woomera under the commercial support program. We do not object to legitimate attempts to save money, but we are totally opposed to cost cutting by stripping employees of benefits to which they are lawfully entitled. Savings should be achieved humanely, in accordance with the government's own industrial relations principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of the CSP to Woomera is not the only case to raise such concerns. The federal Labor member for McEwen, Mr Cleeland, raised similar concerns about its implementation at the Puckapunyal army base in the Sunday <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of 13 February this year. I cannot vouch for the accuracy of Mr Cleeland's allegations, but I would urge the minister to ensure that industrial rights are not again trampled on under the CSP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, and in conclusion, there are some aspects of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> with which the Democrats agree. However, it does not appear to have moved with the times or shown the flexibility and lateral thinking which our new strategic circumstances demand. There are opportunities for a responsible and productive change in course, but it seems to us that Defence remains too preoccupied with the past. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Defence Force of today is shaped by the rigorous application of planning principles enunciated in the Defence of Australia 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>But by the government's own admission in the force structure review, 25 per cent of the program is not achievable. If this is a rigorous application, I would hate to see sloppy application of planning principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review states that Australia's current military relationship with the United States helps maintain US strategic links in this part of the world, and therefore contributes to regional security. That is an absurd leap of faith when one considers the destruction and following security problems wreaked in the pursuit of US national interests in Korea, Vietnam, Iraq and central America, to name a few. A more secure region might be gained through an understanding of the US-Japan relationship, but there is little investigation into how the department feels about that relationship, and the possibilities of Japanese rearmament and even nuclear weapons capability, as flaunted in the Korean nuclear crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also in relation to the United States, rather strange mention is made of our obligations under ANZUS. I ask the question: what exactly are our obligations under ANZUS? It has long been considered and accepted that our obligations were to accept without question, and not necessarily with a great amount of prior information, the visits of nuclear-powered or armed warships. This never has been and never will be part of the ANZUS agreement as it stands. Yet New Zealand was punished for disobeying part of an agreement which did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So our ANZUS agreement required us to provide information only to each other, information which did not seem to be always forthcoming from the United States. It seems as though it was used against us by the US saying, `You'&mdash;that is, Australia and New Zealand&mdash;`must accept the visits of nuclear-powered or armed warships without question, otherwise you have broken the agreement'. It was a nonsense argument then, and is a nonsense argument now. Yet it is still being used in current military reviews. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also mention in section 4.3 of the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993 </EMPHASIS>that Australia provides opportunities for the United States military at little cost to US taxpayers. I can say that but page 37, section 4.11, actually suggests that we offer more. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We should also encourage the United States to use Australian facilities for maintenance and support to assist its continued maritime presence in the region.</PARA>
<PARA>What does this mean? Considering the closure of the Philippines bases, does this mean an invitation to establish full-time United States naval bases in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I return to other questions. Focusing on the near region, the current and longstanding policy is, first, to prop up the post-colonial state of Papua New Guinea against internal threats, such as those in Bougainville, and the external, but hardly ever mentioned, threat from Indonesia; and, secondly, to befriend Indonesia. This policy has prevailed over considerations of self-determination and human rights, and evidently there are no signs of its improving. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review places importance on the strategic commitment to Papua New Guinea and on increasing the capacity of south-west Pacific nations to deal with security problems. It must be recognised that the major security threats to Papua New Guinea begin with ecological and internal social problems, escalating because the Papua New Guinea administration believes it can deal with them through a military response and is supported in this belief by Australia. This current strategic commitment is resulting in significant upheaval in Papua New Guinea and is causing regional concerns with Indonesia, which is wary of any ethnic groups gaining a right to self-determination, and the Solomon Islands, where the PNG military have made incursions and possibly killings while engaged in Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review</EMPHASIS> has not considered that the environmental destruction by international companies, resulting in dislocation of peoples from their lands, spreads the seeds of dissent and fuels arms struggles which when met with excessive military response, do indeed turn into a military problem. This is why a huge crisis began in Bougainville. One only needs to look at the environmental and consequential social upheaval throughout PNG, the Philippines and elsewhere if they wish to avert similar security problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review</EMPHASIS> does not address the necessary steps to end our support for PNG disintegration and Indonesian repression, Australia's actions are a source of insecurity for people in our immediate region. I can quickly outline some points in which Australia can have a role in enhancing security&mdash;steps which are not unknown to the government and Department of Defence, steps that have been outlined by academics and non-government organisations, steps that the department could have seen fit to include had it seriously undertook consultations on the regional security problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, Australia must support regional self-determination, support democratic, non-corrupt movements in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. Practical elements of this would be formulating proposals for resolution of the conflicts in East Timor, west Papua and Bougainville&mdash;this does not imply thrashing the local people into fearsome submission&mdash;suspending the Timor Gap treaty until there is an acceptable resolution of the problem in East Timor, and phasing out military aid to Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Australia needs to tackle controversial issues such as human rights, self-determination and the environment, acknowledging the value of the non-government network. Thirdly, Australia needs to look at some sort of peace building commitment to PNG over the border with Irian-Jaya. I am astounded that the problem in west Papua concerning Indonesia, PNG and Australia receives no special mention, considering the trilateral nature of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must also forestall the regional arms build-up, despite the minister's denial of it. I will give honourable senators some examples from the report. I refer to the introduction on page 1. Key factors of change within the region include `the force modernisation underway in many countries in the region'. That is upgrading, keeping up with the Joneses. Page 11, section 1.32, mentions a switch in emphasis from ground forces orientated to internal security in the region to a `focus on modern maritime and air forces to support new economic and security interests'. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New prosperity will mean that real growth in defence spending is likely to continue, allowing the introduction of high-technology weapons systems. The glut of weapons on the current world arms market will facilitate this.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 1.35 suggests that this accelerated arms race, or buyers' market, will `enhance regional stability' against pressures from `further afield'. Who and how will it be enhancing security from?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is more, page 49, section 5.53, suggests that Australia's standing in the region requires that we keep an edge on `skills in acquiring and adapting high technology for national defence'. If our military thinks this, surely that is also what others in the region believe&mdash;namely, that their military standing depends on the nature of the war toys that they can acquire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reality, the most effective way to forestall the regional arms build-up is to include curbing the long-range naval and air strike capacity and seeking comprehensive arms control agreements. The always anticipated boom in exports sales from the arms industry is not achievable, as was highlighted in the recent hearings of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. I do not know why the department insists, as it does in sections 1.32 and 1.33 of the review, that there is a strategic and economic potential in the regional arms market. The flood of available arms from around the globe keeps our market down to a few specialised goods and services, and anyway serve only to facilitate the abuse of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, going wider than the limited approach presented in this review, Australia must use its aid budget to avert the two major non-military security threats facing Papua New Guinea: resource destruction and environmental degradation, and political disintegration. This would involve stipulating that aid cannot continue under conditions of gross corruption, as examined in Tos Barnett's report a few years ago, and rechannelling aid through non-government organisations to avoid the unaccountability of the current administration. Sixthly, Australia could help establish and fund a conflict mediation service run by the South Pacific forum where government administrations find resources for conflict resolution in short supply or of a biased nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to my last point for the moment, the question of peacekeeping. Again, the review is narrow and unimaginative in its approach to security problems. It places peacekeeping and the vague term of `peace support operations' within the direct defence of Australia. Surely the Department of Defence must realise that peacekeeping in the region is an exercise carried out long before the tensions or conflict reach the stage of threatening Australia's direct interests. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade Government Response to The Report of The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Implications of United States Policies for Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Introduction</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomed the Senate's decision on 16 September 1992 to direct the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to conduct an inquiry into the implications for Australia of United States policies in the context of the 1992 Presidential election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's Report was tabled in the Senate on 16 December 1992. Its terms of reference focused on key issues of concern to Australia, including the likely direction of US trade policy, US security policy in the Asia-Pacific region and the US/Japan relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomed the Committee's Report as a contribution to analysis and public debate on the likely directions of US policy under the new Clinton Administration. The Report, though based on hearings and testimony provided prior to the inauguration of President Clinton, remains relevant in its identification of key issues and their implications for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report's recommendations are consistent with, and build upon, the broad thrust of current policy. The Government's responses to each of the Committee's recommendations are included at the end of this report. Before addressing these recommendations in detail, it is appropriate to offer some broad judgements on the policy directions taken by the Clinton Administration and on their implications for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and the United States have a substantial and wide ranging political, economic and security relationship. Linked by formal alliance for over forty years, both share a deep commitment to democracy, international security and an open world trading system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relationship today is undergoing a process of change. While defence and security ties remain strong, the end of the Cold War, and the growing importance to both countries of the Asia Pacific region, has seen a shift away from the previous emphasis on Western alliance and towards building on common interests in a closer engagement with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The accession to power in both countries of a new generation of political leaders from the post-World War II generation&mdash;and the advent of a Democratic Administration after twelve years of Republican control of the White House&mdash;further marks the onset of a new chapter in the relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has moved quickly and effectively this year to ensure that Australian concerns and interests were signalled, clearly and early, to the new Administration and Congress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The year so far has seen a succession of productive contacts, including numerous Ministerial meetings, the inaugural Trade and Investment Council meeting, a successful Parliamentary delegation visit, the Prime Minister's visit to the United States in September and his subsequent visit to attend the meeting of Economic Leaders of the Asia Pacific Cooperation Forum (APEC) in Seattle in November.  These contacts have afforded Australia an excellent opportunity to impress upon the new Administration our concerns and interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration has provided excellent access to Australian Ministers, members of Parliament and officials, and has shown itself to be receptive to Australian ideas. Senior Administration officials have recognised Australia as an important partner on a range of bilateral, regional and international issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's discussions with President Clinton confirmed and gave renewed impetus to the traditional patterns of friendship and bilateral and international cooperation between our countries. At the same time, their discussions demonstrated that shared interests in the Asia Pacific region are now central to the relationship, with Australia's importance in regional affairs clearly acknowledged by the United States.In the Asia Pacific region, the Clinton Administration has emphasised that the United States intends to share in the development of a "New Pacific Community" to foster security, prosperity and democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his visit to Japan and Korea in July, President Clinton reaffirmed in the clearest possible terms the United States's security commitments in the region, both with respect to existing treaty ties&mdash;including with Australia&mdash;and also in terms of US support for new forms of multilateral security dialogue. The latter represents a significant step forward in US policy, and one that is fully consonant with Australian objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration has also made a strong commitment to APEC as the region's pre-eminent forum for economic cooperation. President Clinton's decision to convene a meeting in Seattle of APEC Leaders at the time of the Ministerial meeting was welcomed by Australia, the Prime Minister having proposed such meetings since January 1992. Again, during the Leaders meeting, the Administration made clear the value it attaches to Australia's contribution to the formation and development of APEC. The Leaders meeting was very successful in consolidating support for APEC and its future agenda and reaffirmed the importance of a successful conclusion to the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration's approach to trade policy has become clearer as the year unfolded. There has been a welcome reaffirmation of US commitment to an open multilateral trading system, including through an early and successful close to the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration was successful in securing Congressional approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), despite strident opposition. This was seen as a litmus test of the direction of US trade policy: defeat for NAFTA would have been an indication that protectionist sentiment was becoming more influential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAFTA is likely to have mixed implications for Australia&mdash;on the one hand NAFTA will stimulate growth in North America and thus create additional trade and investment opportunities; on the other, NAFTA's rules of origin and local content provisions have the potential to divert trade and investment flows to the detriment of third countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alongside its Uruguay Round and NAFTA commitments, the Administration has also placed the highest priority on pursuing a results-oriented trade policy and on reducing its trade deficits with major Asian trading partners, especially Japan. Again, the record is not yet complete enough to form a definitive judgement. Australia has registered very clearly with the USA that we are opposed to any form of managed trade or discriminatory bilateral arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the bilateral trade front, we continue to have serious concern over a range of US actions and policies which either limit Australian access to the US market or damage our interests in third markets. The Government has put these to the Administration with persistence and vigour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration has acknowledged that Australian representations in regard to the bilateral trade imbalance&mdash;which is proportionally larger than the US imbalance with Japan&mdash;have some validity. The Administration has also agreed on the need to engage in substantive and serious dialogue on addressing mutual trade concerns, including through the Trade and Investment Council which met at Ministerial level for the first time in June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton specifically acknowledged Australian concerns with regard to the Export Enhancement Program (EEP) in his joint press conference with Prime Minister Keating, giving assurances that his Administration would "go out of its way" to avoid conflict with Australia's trading interests. The Government is seeking to ensure that these assurances are fully reflected in the administration of the EEP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Internationally, the Administration has placed non-proliferation concerns at the top of its agenda, an approach which Australia strongly supports. The Government also welcomes the steps the Administration has taken in extending its nuclear testing moratorium and its preparedness to commence negotiations for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration is also strongly committed to reforming and strengthening the United Nations and its peacekeeping and collective security activities, objectives to which Australia too is strongly committed and where our credentials as a valued international partner are clearly recognised by the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance, then, the policy directions of the new Administration contain much that is consonant with Australian interests. While our differences on some trade issues remain of serious concern, it is inevitable, in a relationship as substantial and broad-ranging as ours, that some differences will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has succeeded in establishing a sound and cordial relationship with the new Administration and looks forward to a positive and constructive dialogue to address mutual concerns and achieve progress on shared objectives, especially in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION: POLICIES AND PRIORITIES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Foreign Policy Priorities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton is the first President of the post-Cold War era and faces the difficult challenge of giving new purpose and direction to US foreign policy now that the organising principle of the past four decades&mdash;containment and defeat of Soviet communism&mdash;is a thing of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be no easy task. The monolith of the Soviet threat has been replaced by a mosaic of regional, ethnic and religious conflicts whose causes are complex and whose solutions elusive&mdash;and in which direct American interests may be hard to discern. Economic competition is gaining importance in world affairs, placing new stresses on Cold War alliances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addressing these challenges, President Clinton must also take account of the changed national mood in the United States. After fifty years of engagement and leadership against fascism and totalitarianism, the American public is now looking first and foremost to the home front&mdash;to domestic social and economic issues such as deficit reduction, health care reform and economic recovery&mdash;issues which President Clinton has also identified as key priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton is firmly committed to continuing US engagement in world affairs, arguing that as a leading democracy, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the world's largest national economy and its only military superpower, the United States has vital interests and a fundamental obligation to remain actively engaged in world affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his first nine months in office, President Clinton has had to wrestle with a wide range of complex and difficult international problems, including Bosnia and Somalia. The Administration's handling of such issues has generated debate and controversy over the appropriate scope of US engagement and the extent to which US interests are at stake.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these issues have tended to dominate public debate in America on President Clinton's foreign policy, the Administration can legitimately point also to issues where the United States has played a positive role, including support for reform in Russia, reactivating the Middle East peace process and assisting in the achievement of the historic agreement between Israel and the PLO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From Australia's perspective, there have been a number of foreign policy developments under the Clinton Administration which accord with Australian interests and objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration's emphasis on closer engagement in the Asia Pacific region, which will be discussed in more detail below, is an important and welcome development at a time when Australia is integrating more closely with the region and when doubts existed over the level of US interest in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton has also given priority to preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. While the end of the Cold War has greatly reduced the threat of strategic nuclear conflict, the threats posed by the spread of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons, and of the technologies for delivering them&mdash;especially through use of ballistic missiles&mdash;has emerged as a fundamental challenge to peace and stability in the post-Cold War world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his address to the United Nations General Assembly on 27 September 1993, President Clinton outlined his Administration's policies on curbing the spread of weapons of mass destruction and their delivery systems. The Australian Government is at one with the United States in viewing this threat with the utmost concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia plays a significant role in the fields of arms control and non-proliferation, and has worked closely with the US and others to achieve major arms control objectives, most recently the successful negotiation of the Chemical Weapons Convention. We share strong support for the global nuclear non-proliferation regime, based on the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and for the nuclear safeguards system of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The indications so far bear out the Committee's judgement (2.51-2.60) that a Clinton Administration will accelerate movement on a range of arms control issues. The Clinton Administration is maintaining the Bush Administration's policy of attaching the highest priority to ratification and implementation of the START agreements by Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan and their accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty as non-nuclear weapons states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration has extended the moratorium on nuclear testing embraced, with some reservations, by the Bush Administration last year and is fully supporting negotiation of a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The indications are that the Administration is also developing a commendably broad-based approach in dealing with problems posed by the proliferation of exotic weaponry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton has also given priority to enhancing the capacity of the multilateral system in addressing global problems, including through reforming and strengthening the United Nations in its capacity to meet the ever expanding demand for peace-keeping operations, and in reviewing the membership of the Security Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton has taken important initiatives on international environmental negotiations, including signing the Biodiversity Convention and adopting a more positive approach to the obligations of the Climate Change Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THE ASIA-PACIFIC REGION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration has articulated a broad policy framework for the region which contains much that accords with Australian policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first major exposition of the Administration's Asia-Pacific policy framework came in the testimony of the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston Lord, in his Senate confirmation hearing on 31 March. In July, President Clinton underscored US commitment to the Asia-Pacific region in major speeches in Japan and Korea&mdash;significantly, President Clinton's first overseas trip was to Asia. In November, President Clinton hosted in Seattle the inaugural meeting of the Economic Leaders of the APEC Forum&mdash;a very successful initiative which drew the Leaders of economies accounting for half the world's production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton and his senior officials have laid particular emphasis on the concept of a "New Pacific Community", reflecting the Administration's support for the growing sense of community among regional states, embracing firstly economic relations but also beginning, in various forums, to include political and security relations as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States has a major stake in the continued prosperity and security of the region. Forty per cent of US trade is now with this region, half as large again as American trade with Europe. As Asian economies enjoy some of the highest growth rates in the world, the United States economy has much to gain from participating fully in the expanding commercial ties with the region. The Australian Government strongly welcomes the Administration's commitment to participating in the evolution of a Pacific community of nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REGIONAL SECURITY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration has strongly reaffirmed its existing bilateral security commitments, including to Australia through ANZUS, while also taking on a more active role in the development of a more broadly based dialogue among regional states on issues of common security concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his speech before the Korean National Assembly on 10 July, President Clinton affirmed his Administration's commitment to regional security, including the importance attached to multilateral security forums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has been a leading player in fostering the development of regional security dialogues, which can make an important contribution in consolidating peace and security in the fluidity of the post-Cold War world. The multilateral dialogue is designed to complement and build upon the existing bilateral ties between the United States and selected regional states and to strengthen confidence and patterns of cooperation among regional states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Bush Administration initially held some reservations about participating in multilateral security dialogues in the region, it subsequently began to show more enthusiasm for this approach. It is encouraging that the new Administration has moved quickly in committing itself to this process, which has centred upon the annual ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference (PMC), and will in future increasingly focus on the ASEAN Regional Forum, established during the last ASEAN PMC in Singapore from 26-28 July. The ASEAN Regional Forum includes, for the first time, China, Russia, Vietnam, Laos and Papua New Guinea in a new dialogue process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a sign of US commitment to multilateral security dialogue that the US strongly supported the creation of this new and inclusive body.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration played a key role in persuading North Korea to suspend its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council and as a leading force for countering proliferation, the United States will continue to have a major role to play in addressing this complex and serious problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Clinton Administration has reaffirmed its security interests and commitments in the region, it is nonetheless legitimate to ask whether the substantial defence cuts foreshadowed by the Administration will over time weaken the capacity of the United States to project power and deploy forces in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the judgement arrived at in the Committee's report, namely that in the short term at least, the nature and scope of US force reductions in the region should not diminish the ability of the United States to meet security demands and foreseeable contingencies (2.31). This has been confirmed in the Clinton Administration's "Bottom-Up Review" of US force structure released in September this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States has strongly reaffirmed its security commitments to Japan and Korea. In his visits to Japan and Korea in July, President Clinton reaffirmed in the clearest possible terms the US's commitment to its Asia-Pacific treaty partners (including Australia) and also reiterated the US intention to maintain its forward force deployments which continue to play a key role in regional stability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maintenance of strong US forward deployments in Japan and Korea is assisted by the generous levels of support provided by those countries as hosts to US forces and facilities. Japan meets around three quarters of the non-salary costs of US forces deployed there, amounting to over $3 billion per annum (and equivalent to about ten per cent of Japan's defence budget). Korea provides a similar level of support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has played a leading role in the formation and evolution of APEC which has now established itself as the pre-eminent forum for economic cooperation in the region. It has also given impetus to efforts to free up world trade through the Uruguay Round and has made a start towards liberalising trade among its own members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully shares the view expressed in the Committee report that the United States should be encouraged to continue to play an active role in APEC. It is therefore gratifying to observe that the Clinton Administration has signalled a very clear commitment to the APEC process and has elevated APEC to the forefront of its regional trade strategies. The United States held the chair of APEC in 1993, hosting the Ministerial meeting in Seattle in November and the inaugural meeting of the economic leaders of APEC, providing an excellent opportunity to reinforce United States commitment to the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia welcomed President Clinton's proposal to host a meeting of APEC leaders in Seattle in November 1993. The meeting resulted in support for the continued development of APEC as a forum dedicated to producing tangible economic benefits for the region. Leaders agreed to convene a meeting of Finance Ministers, establish a Pacific Business Forum, strengthen policy dialogue on small and medium sized businesses, establish an APEC education program and an APEC business volunteer program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is strongly committed to pursuing a broadranging agenda of trade and investment facilitation through APEC and is also working closely with the Clinton Administration in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through its Embassy in Washington, the Government has also sought to encourage Congressional interest in and awareness of APEC. The Chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Lee Hamilton, is among a number of members of Congress who are taking a keen interest in APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is clearly a role here for members of the Australian Parliament to reinforce with members of the United States Congress, through formal and informal links, the vital importance of APEC for the region, and to encourage an active, constructive and ongoing US role in APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">US/JAPAN RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No relationship is more important for the security and prosperity of the region and for Australia than the US/Japan relationship. Together Japan and the United States provide nearly forty per cent of world output. Two-way trade is around US$140 billion. The US/Japan security relationship has played, and continues to play, a critical role in maintaining the stability and security of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The relationship between the United States and Japan has particular significance for Australia. They are our two largest trading partners and the United States is our most important ally and treaty partner. Both are key players in the future of the region, for example through the roles they play in APEC and in regional security. Internationally, the policies of the United States, and increasingly those of Japan, materially affect issues of vital importance to Australia, ranging from the Uruguay Round, UN reform, peace-keeping, development assistance, and efforts to tackle transnational issues such as the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration has signalled clearly that it regards no relationship as more important than that with Japan. During the visit to the United States by Prime Minister Miyazawa in April, in President Clinton's visit to Tokyo in July, and in the meeting between President Clinton and Prime Minister Hosokawa in Seattle, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the three key elements in the relationship&mdash;security ties, trade and global partnership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the first and third of these elements, the outlook remains positive. With respect to trade, the United States and Japan are again in a period of increased tension. Both sides will have to adopt a reasoned and balanced approach if these problems are to be handled in a manner which will avoid undercutting the Uruguay Round negotiations and the positive evolution of APEC and also avoid generating uncertainty over the regional economic outlook.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Clinton Administration has said that in the post-Cold War period, the economic relationship with Japan has acquired an increased importance. The Administration, indeed, describes Japan as a special case, arguing that the size and persistence of the United States trade deficit with Japan is proof that Japanese economic practices and policies result in unfair limitations on US exports to Japan of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration is placing emphasis on a results-oriented approach, and during the Miyazawa visit it was agreed that a sectoral/structural agreement would be negotiated by the time of President Clinton's visit to Tokyo for the G-7 Summit in July.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement, known as the US-Japan Framework for a New Economic Partnership, was announced in Tokyo on 10 July. The agreement is based on reciprocal macro-economic undertakings, with Japan agreeing to make "highly significant" reductions in its trade surplus and to boost imports, and the US promising to cut its budget surplus and work to improve its competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these broad pledges, the Agreement identifies five areas where further sectoral or structural negotiations or consultations will be undertaken, with various timetables for completion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Framework Agreement leaves ample scope for differences of interpretation and implementation and there is no guarantee that it will lead to successful resolution of US-Japan trade frictions. Nevertheless, the Agreement is a positive development in that it provides a framework within which the world's and the region's pre-eminent economies can work constructively in addressing economic problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government awaits a clearer picture of the sectoral/structural negotiations and their implementation arrangements. In discussions with both countries, the Government will continue to make clear its concern that in addressing bilateral problems there should be no resort to discriminatory managed trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">US TRADE POLICY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States has been one of the pillars of the free trading system which has contributed so much to world growth since World War II. Continued American commitment to free trade and to GATT principles is imperative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advent of a Democratic Administration has given rise to concerns over the direction of US trade policy, since historically the Democrats have been seen as more inclined to protectionist or aggressive trade policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During its first year of the Clinton Administration has sent out some conflicting signals, creating uncertainty over the broad thrust of US trade policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the one hand, the Administration has strongly reaffirmed its commitment to free trade principles. In his first major address on trade policy, President Clinton said at the American University on 26 February that the truth of our age is this&mdash;open and competitive commerce will enrich us as a nation. It spurs us to innovate. It forces us to compete . . . in the face of all the pressures to do the reverse, we must compete, not retreat.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No clearer affirmation of free trade could be wished for.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">President Clinton has also stressed, including in his American University speech, that the United States must acknowledge that many of its deficiencies in competitiveness are "made in America" and can only be redressed by American efforts and not by shifting blame onto trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration has also given priority to pursuing a successful conclusion to the already protracted Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Administration introduced a bill in Congress on 27 April to extend fast track authority until 15 December and Congressional approval was completed on 30 June. President Clinton reaffirmed US commitment to a successful and balanced Uruguay Round outcome in his meeting with Prime Minister Keating in September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this welcome reaffirmation of free trade and the rules-based GATT system, however, there are also more ambivalent signals. The Administration is placing great emphasis on achieving quick results in opening foreign markets and has signalled that it is prepared to use whatever methods seem necessary to achieve this, including unilateral ones. The danger here is that the Administration will resort to methods which will offer the illusion of short-term gain but at the risk of damaging bilateral and multilateral trading relationships in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Administration officials have indicated, for example, that they favour reviving the currently lapsed "Super 301" provisions of US trade legislation, which would allow the United States to identify countries it thought were maintaining unfair trading practices, and impose mandatory negotiations, and possibly unilateral sanctions, if the negotiations did not meet US goals. Legislation of this kind also has strong supporters in Congress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administration has also signalled, particularly with regard to Japan, a results-oriented approach that involves sector-specific identification of appropriate criteria for assessing the level of access for American goods and services. While the Administration denies that this approach is tantamount to "managed trade", there are certainly grounds for concern that this might be the ultimate outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is concerned that widespread resort to unilateralism or managed trade along these lines by the United States would have a profoundly unsettling and negative effect, particularly in our region where some of the largest US trade deficits exist. If countries like Japan are required to tailor access to their markets to satisfy US demands, third parties are likely to be disadvantaged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior members of the Administration, including the President, have said that they regard distinctions between unilateral, bilateral, regional and multilateral approaches as a "distracting debate" and have emphasised that it is results that count.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The emphasis on a results-oriented trade policy, though more explicit than that enunciated by the Bush or Reagan Administrations, is a continuation of a shift in emphasis in US trade policy that first emerged in the early 1980s. In its multi-stranded trade policy the United States began to focus more attention on bilateral agreements and vigorous pursuit of unilateral action, in addition to its support for the GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change in emphasis was reflected in negotiation of bilateral free trade agreements with Israel (1985) and Canada (1988) and the trilateral NAFTA agreement signed with Mexico and Canada in 1992. Congress also passed amended trade laws (including the so-called "Special 301" and "Super 301") that either required or provided scope for the Administration to apply unilateral sanctions more widely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government accepts that a range of different trade policy approaches may be pursued simultaneously. What is essential, however, is that the various instruments being used should all be consistent with rules-based GATT principles. Unilateralism and multilateralism are not simply two of a range of equally valid alternative trade strategies, and the US Administration needs to address this squarely and make clearer to its trading partners that it remains committed to the rules-based GATT principles which have served the world, and the United States, so well for the last four decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAFTA</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee report devoted considerable attention to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), signed by Presidents Bush and Salinas, and Prime Minister Mulroney, on 17 December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following intensive lobbying and public debate, legislation to implement NAFTA was passed by the US House of Representatives on 17 November and the US Senate on 20 November. The agreement will come into effect from 1 January 1994 following ratification by the Mexican Senate on 22 November and proclamation of Canada's legislation&mdash;the new Canadian government sought reassurance from the USA on some issues before doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US Administration was successful in securing the necessary Congressional votes, but only after making the issue a critical one for the future of the Clinton presidency. This, plus the Administration's concerted lobbying campaign and willingness to bargain for votes, proved sufficient to overcome the concerns of Congressional representatives about job losses, reductions in US workers' rights and environmental standards and a prominent campaign by former Presidential candidate Ross Perot, high ranking Democrats in Congress and the US trade union movement. The vote on NAFTA was seen by many international observers as a litmus test of the strength of protectionist and isolationist sentiment in the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implications of NAFTA for Australia and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region appear likely to be mixed. On the one hand, NAFTA is likely to stimulate growth throughout the large North American market (370 million people), increasing opportunities for trade and investment there. On the other there is the potential for trade and investment diversion which would affect Australia and other countries in the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia, the direct trade and investment effects of NAFTA are in general not expected to be great, but there are potentially serious implications for our exports of meat, sugar and dairy products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of Australia's exports to the USA, including meat, steel, sugar and dairy products, and some to Canada (beef) are subject to restrictions imposed by the US or Canadian governments. NAFTA will not alter any of these restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The indirect effects (i.e. on our trade and investment in third countries) are likely to be more significant for Australia than the direct effects in the longer term. In particular, the stringent local content and rules of origin provisions of NAFTA (a surrogate industry policy) are likely in effect to raise trade barriers for third countries and thus cause trade diversion. The local content provisions appear likely to have a particularly strong effect on some major sectors of interest to Asian producers, including textiles, autos and auto parts, with possible flow-on effects for Australian inputs into those exports (e.g. coal, iron ore, wool, and automotive components).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NAFTA may also have both beneficial and adverse effects on the international trading system. NAFTA establishes high standards in a number of areas which will establish important precedents for future trade agreements, including the GATT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there would be concern if NAFTA were to encourage the proliferation of preferential (and therefore discriminatory) trade agreements or the division of the world into a few trading blocs, and reduce support for the liberal, multilateral trading system. This would be exacerbated if NAFTA were to form the basis of `hub and spokes' arrangements (i.e. one where the hub&mdash;e.g. the USA&mdash;has different agreements with the spokes, which do not have similar agreements among themselves).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key issue for the future will be expansion of NAFTA. The US implementing legislation requires the President to report to Congress on or before 1 July 1994 and again before 1 July 1997 with recommendations for free trade negotiations with countries nominated by the President. These countries are required already to be providing access for US goods and investment beyond that required under the GATT or to offer significant opportunities for US trade and investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expansion of NAFTA would be likely to have a greater effect on Australia as some Latin American countries such as Chile (which is expected to be the first country to join an expanded NAFTA) are competitors for Australian exports to North America in a larger range of goods and services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is completing a study which analyses the implications of NAFTA for Australia's current main exports to North America. The study is expected to be released publicly in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SCHEDULE OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND RESPONSES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.16  Recommendation one: The Committee recommends that the Prime Minister of Australia make a visit to the United States as early in the new presidency as possible and that an early invitation be extended to President Clinton to visit Australia. One purpose of these visits should be to inform the President of the importance Australia attaches to the continuing engagement of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government endorses the Committee's view on the importance of high-level contacts to ensure that Australian perspectives on the Asia-Pacific region are clearly understood in Washington.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister conducted a highly successful visit to the United States from 12-16 September 1993, holding discussions with President Clinton and senior members of his Administration including Secretary of State Christopher, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bensten, Defense Secretary Les Aspin, United States Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and the Director of Central Intelligence James Woolsey. Mr Keating also met senior Congressional leaders from both parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's visit was successful in establishing a close working relationship with President Clinton. Their discussions reaffirmed the longstanding patterns of cooperation between the two countries, and gave clear expression to the interests we share in working together in the Asia Pacific region to strengthen and expand economic, political and security links and in achieving a successful and balanced outcome to the Uruguay Round.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister met President Clinton again in Seattle in November. Their discussions highlighted a mutual vision for regional economic cooperation. The Prime Minister also conveyed Australia's interest in a visit to Australia by the President at a mutually convenient time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial contacts are also a key element in Australia's pursuit of its interests in the relationship. The Australia/United States Ministerial Talks (AUSMIN), in which Australia is represented by the Foreign and Defence Ministers and the United States by the Secretaries of State and Defense, take place about every twelve months and provide a highly effective forum for discussion of bilateral, regional and international issues of mutual concern.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ausmin Talks were scheduled to take place in Australia at the end of July but had to be deferred until early 1994 when Secretary of State Christopher was recalled to Washington by President Clinton for urgent consultations on the Middle East and Bosnia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have already been numerous Ministerial contacts with the Clinton Administration this year. The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, and the then Minister for Trade and Overseas Development, Mr Kerin, visited Washington in January and February. Soon after the Australian general election, the Foreign Minister Senator Evans visited Washington, and he has met with Secretary of State Christopher on several occasions subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Trade, Senator Cook, visited the United States in June 1993 where he met with five key Cabinet members and held the inaugural Ministerial talks under the Australia/US Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement (TIFA). Senator Cook's visit was important not only in terms of the bilateral trade relationship but more broadly in terms of underlining and cementing support for APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans and Senator Cook also attended the APEC Ministerial meeting (APEC V) in Seattle in November which dealt, in a forward looking way, with APEC's longer term goals, its mechanisms and work programs, particularly through the Eminent Persons Group Report and the endorsement of a permanent Committee on Trade and Investment (CTI).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other Ministerial visits include those by the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories Ms Kelly, the Treasurer Mr Dawkins, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy Mr Crean, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training Mr Beazley, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Arts and Administrative Services Senator McMullan and the Minister for Social Security Mr Baldwin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is also an important role for the Australian Parliament to play in fostering American understanding of Australian policies and interests. A Parliamentary delegation under the leadership of the Speaker Mr Martin completed a highly successful visit the United States in June, which included a meeting with Vice President Gore and the Congressional leadership.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through Ministerial contacts and through other channels, the Australian Government is well placed to impress upon the Clinton Administration the importance of the United States developing a coherent policy framework towards the Asia-Pacific region and applying that framework in a consistent fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.18  Recommendation two: The Committee recommends that the Government give a high priority to reviewing possible ways of drawing the United States into multilateral dialogue on security issues in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government strongly endorses this recommendation, which is consistent with the Government's established policy of fostering multilateral security dialogue in the region and of encouraging a constructive US engagement in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bush Administration, the Government sought to allay US concerns about multilateral dialogue by arguing that multilateral forums would complement and support, rather than challenge, the existing network of largely bilateral security arrangements in the region which mostly involve the United States.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government strongly welcomes the shift in policy under the Clinton Administration, which has become an active and fully committed partner in the broadening of the regional security dialogue including through creation of the ASEAN Regional Forum. There is now a wide area of agreement between Australia and the United States on the question of multilateral security dialogue in the region and we look forward to further close cooperation with the Administration in this important area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.21  Recommendation three:  The Committee recommends that the Australian government continue to pursue a threefold strategy of:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">encouraging United States commitment to multilateral free trade;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">drawing the United States as fully as possible into the economic networks of the Asia Pacific region; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">identifying the most effective means available to ameliorate the bilateral and other trade problems between the United States and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the light of the change in leadership in the United States, the Committee recommends that there be an increase in the effort devoted over the next twelve month period to achieving these objectives, particularly with regard to the second and third objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports this recommendation, which is consistent with strategies already being pursued by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.1</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been the established policy of this Government to encourage United States commitment to upholding and strengthening an open multilateral trading system, including giving the highest priority to the GATT and to early and successful completion of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The indications so far are that the Clinton Administration will maintain a policy of strong support for the multilateral system. President Clinton and the US Congress are committed to early completion of the Uruguay Round through legislation extending the Administration's "fast-track" negotiating authority until 15 December 1993. The President's commitment was reaffirmed in his meeting with the Prime Minister in September and at APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government considers that the extension of fast track to mid-December provides a credible time-frame for conclusion of the negotiations, while maintaining a sense of discipline and urgency. The Government welcomes the fact that fast track extension was not encumbered with conditions, such as renewal of "Super 301" or similar unilateral trade measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond this broad commitment to free trade principles, however, the future direction of US trade policy remains uncertain. The signals emerging from the Administration thus far have been somewhat mixed, giving rise to some concern among trading partners over the likely evolution of US trade policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a major speech at the American University on 26 February, President Clinton strongly endorsed free trade. Saying that the United States must compete, not retreat, he acknowledged that many of America's economic problems were "made in America" and should not be blamed on trading partners.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the same speech, however, the President said that American trade policy would bypass what he described as "distracting debate" over whether efforts should be multilateral, regional, bilateral or unilateral. This is a view being echoed by other senior figures in the Administration, including US Trade Representative Mickey Kantor and Commerce Secretary Ron Brown.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government accepts that a flexible approach to trade policy mechanisms is appropriate and that bilateral, regional and multilateral initiatives are not mutually exclusive. It is vitally important, however, that whatever trade strategies the United States chooses to employ should be fully consistent with its international obligations and with rules-based GATT principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.2</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the second part of the recommendation, the real issue is perhaps not so much drawing the United States into the economic networks of the region, as it is ensuring that the United States's economic relations with the region develop along cooperative rather than confrontational lines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States is already a major player in the region's economic dynamism. Forty per cent of its trade is with the region, half as much again as US trade with Europe: only a decade ago these trade flows were about equal. The United States is an active member of APEC and closely engaged with ASEAN through the dialogue relationship. The United States has reacted strongly to any suggestions that it might be left out of regional economic arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The United States continues to play a strong and constructive role in APEC and held the APEC chair in 1993, passing it to Indonesia at the Ministerial meeting held in Seattle in November. This meeting, the fifth APEC Ministerial meeting, was followed by an inaugural meeting of the leaders of APEC economies. Australia welcomed the US proposal to host the leaders meeting which was attended by fourteen APEC member economic leaders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and the United States have been working together constructively with other APEC members to expand APEC's regional trade and investment agenda. The Seattle meetings endorsed a Trade and Investment Framework which established a permanent Committee on Trade and Investment and approved a solid work program with initial focus on trade facilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key aspect of the framework has been to identify the goal of creating an open, integrated market in the Asia-Pacific. The framework has also provided the vehicle for a medium to long term work program designed to expand opportunities for, and address the impediments to, greater regional integration as enunciated by the Prime Minister earlier this year. These initiatives build on the important progress made in the former informal APEC Group on Regional Trade Liberalisation (RTL) and the ten APEC Working Groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation 3.3</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to amelioration of bilateral trade problems, the Government has been pursuing an active role in seeking solutions to what are admittedly longstanding difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An important element in the Government's strategy has been the establishment of appropriate channels through which Australia can convey its concerns and pursue its interests with the United States Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia and the United States agreed in December 1992 to establish a Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement (TIFA) as a high-level forum for addressing trade and investment issues. Under the TIFA, a Trade and Investment Council is to meet approximately annually at Ministerial level. Australia is represented by the Minister for Trade and the United States by the US Trade Representative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The initial TIFA Council meeting was held on 9-10 June in Washington, with the Minister for Trade Senator Cook representing Australia. The Government was pleased with the positive discussions at the initial TIFA meeting and will make every effort to ensure that the TIFA becomes an effective forum for protecting and promoting Australian interests in the trade and investment relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to agricultural trade, the Government is pursuing a range of initiatives as part of an interrelated strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 the Government, through the Joint Parliamentary Delegation led by Dr Blewett, proposed to the United States the establishment of a consultative mechanism on agricultural trade issues. Following United States agreement, the first round of talks, at senior officials level, was held in August 1991. The fourth round of talks was held in Washington on 26-27 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that these consultations have been helpful in giving Australia a forum for full and frank discussion of our concerns. The advent of a new Administration in Washington adds to the importance of using these consultations to register our concerns in an effective fashion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the shorter term, our efforts are directed to getting the United States to administer its current laws in a manner which increases market access for our exports to the United States (for example for meat, sugar and dairy products) and which minimises the impact of US export subsidies (for example the Export Enhancement Program or EEP, the Dairy Export Incentive Program or DEIP and the cotton program).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In seeking to limit the damage caused by current US programs, the Government works closely with Australian industries to identify pressure points and develop effective strategies to pursue with the US Administration. Australian representations have had some effect, albeit at the margin, in that the 1993-94 EEP and DEIP programs have not been extended to key Asian markets of most concern to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senior Administration officials have acknowledged that Australian representations have had some influence on the final shape of their agricultural export programs this year. Some Administration officials also acknowledge that US policies and actions damage Australian interests. Winston Lord, for example, readily acknowledged in an interview on 18 August that "there are areas here that are somewhat less than free trade in the US regime and it does seem to hit Australia more than other countries. Australia has a major deficit with us".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the Prime Minister's visit to Washington in September, President Clinton acknowledged Australia's standing as an agricultural free trader and gave assurances his Administration would "go out of its way" to implement the EEP in such a way as to avoid damage to Australian trade interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these statements are a welcome indication that Australia's voice is indeed heard in Washington, there are no grounds for complacency. Concerted and sustained Australian pressure, through official and private sector contacts, will be required to ensure that assurances given are carried through.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the longer term, we need to seek fundamental reform of currently mandated US agriculture programs, especially the Food, Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (usually referred to as the Farm Act) and the Meat Import Law (MIL).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The stated commitment of the Clinton Administration to improve US competitiveness and reduce the Federal budget deficit, as well as the Congressional process for renewal of the Farm Act in 1995, provide a focus for seeking amendment to US farm policies and legislation which adversely affect Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The elevated priority being given to reducing the Federal budget deficit may lead to a more rational allocation of resources under the next Farm Act. In the lead up to the 1990 farm legislation, efforts were made, including by consumer advocates and proponents of fiscal responsibility, to highlight the costs to the wider US community of farm programs which in some instances had their origins decades ago in entirely different circumstances. One of our priorities over the next two years will be to seek to influence debate within the US about the domestic and international impact of US agricultural policies in the lead-up to the 1995 Farm Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.24  Recommendation four:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pay particular attention to identifying United States' self-interests, and how they may coincide with Australian interests, in any trade proposals or representations we make, both bilaterally and in APEC, and ensuring that the matters identified are widely known within the United States, particularly by potential allies within the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an established element in Australian trade policy to make use of strategic alliances and coalitions with specific interest groups in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strategy of this kind, of course, needs to be handled with sensitivity. There are occasions when interest groups in the United States are happy to have the support of foreign corporations or governments in their efforts to influence US policy or laws; equally there are going to be occasions when a highly visible campaign by a foreign government or industry might be seen as inappropriate or counterproductive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is considerable sensitivity in the United States in relation to the activities of lobbyists on behalf of foreign interests, particularly where former Administration officials are concerned. This sensitivity has been reflected in the formulation by the Clinton Administration of a new code of conduct for Administration officials, with a specific focus on limiting the scope for officials working on behalf of foreign interests soon after leaving office.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a wide-ranging debate in the United States&mdash;within the Administration, within the Congress, within the private sector, and within universities and think tanks&mdash;on what sort of trade strategies the United States should pursue. A key element in Australia's strategy is to impress upon the United States the costs and risks entailed in pursuing trade strategies which rely on unilateral or coercive methods or which involve managed trade, and to stress the benefits of maintaining an open multilateral trading system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC also addresses the concerns underlying this recommendation in a number of ways, particularly the interests of all Asia-Pacific players (including the US) in fostering a healthy economic climate. Through its advocacy of the principle of open regionalism, APEC recognises the fact that the key to continued growth of Asia Pacific economies lies in promoting an open liberal trade environment which places emphasis on a cooperative trans-Pacific environment rather than one characterised by confrontation and bilateral disputation. As the Minister for Trade Senator Cook said to the Malaysia-Australia Business Council in Kuala Lumpur on 26 April :</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We equally believe that in an environment of possible trade tension between the United States and Japan or other East Asian economies that APEC could be of great value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong commitment of the Clinton Administration and the US Congress to deficit reduction is also a factor that should favour a more rational approach to resource allocation and may help rein in domestic programs and export subsidies that distort the market, penalise US consumers and hinder the overall competitiveness of the US economy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.25  Recommendation five:  The Committee recommends that the existing programs of exchange of visitors between Australia and the United States be intensified. In particular the Committee recommends that the major emphasis be placed on identifying well informed Australian experts, both government and non government, in the fields of most concern to us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government maintains a range of visitor and exchange programs which include the United States. The Special Visits Program (SVP) and the Visit Australia Program (VAP) have brought a range of influential United States personalities to Australia in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the SVP is to build an understanding of Australia and its place in the world through visits to Australia by individuals who are eminent in their fields and are in a position to contribute to greater awareness of Australian policies and concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prominent Americans to visit Australia in recent years under the SVP include Dean Kleckner, President of the American Farm Bureau Federation; Laverne Hubert, Legislative Director of the House of Representatives Committee on Agriculture; Charles Riemenschneider, Chief of Staff of the Senate Agriculture Committee and Gerald Curtis, Professor of Political Science and Director of the East Asian Institute at Columbia University.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be clear from the above that Australia's agriculture and trade interests, as well as our Asia-Pacific priorities, figure prominently in our criteria for the SVP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant recent visitors under the VAP include Dr Fred Bergsten, who visited Australia in 1991. Dr Bergsten has had a distinguished career in international economics, serving as Director of the Institute for International Economics in Washington DC. Dr Bergsten has been appointed as the US representative to the APEC Eminent Persons Group of which he acts as Chairman.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also worth noting was a visit in May this year by six influential US agricultural reporters. The group made an extensive tour of Australian farming districts and met a range of Government and private sector contacts, including the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the National Farmers Federation as well as visiting farms and rural areas. The visit has resulted in a number of media reports, including in the influential US Farm Report, favourably portraying the Australian farming sector and acknowledging the damage done to Australian farmers by US trade policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another significant public affairs success this year was a series of six live two-hour broadcasts from Australia of the Good Morning America program. Subjects included tourism, multiculturalism, the political system, Aboriginal culture and the medical system. An interview with the Prime Minister was also broadcast. The programs generated keen interest in the USA with a surge of tourism enquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Department of Defence also actively encourages an exchange of visitors between Australia and the United States, including senior US Defence officials, members of Congress, academics and representatives from US services and service colleges. In 1992 there were 59 VIP visits to Australia including a visit by Secretary of Defense Richard Cheney for the fiftieth anniversary of the Battle of the Coral Sea. Thirteen senior Australian Defence officials visited the United States last year, including the Minister for Defence and the Chief of the Defence Force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Programs of this kind clearly have an important role to play. An intensification of such programs with respect to the United States, as advocated by the Committee, has obvious resource implications and also raises questions over the relative priority to be attached to visits from the United States as compared to visits from other countries. The key to the success of these programs is to ensure that the selection of candidates is well targeted in accordance with Australian priorities and that the visitors' programs are thoughtfully prepared so as to maximise the benefit to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.26 Recommendation six:  The Committee recommends that an in depth study be undertaken to identify the costs to the United States economy overall, and the costs to particular sectors, of the continuation of the United States agricultural subsidy program and other forms of protection of domestic agricultural producers. This study should seek to identify specific interest groups whose interests would most coincide with Australian interests in seeing an end to these subsidies, for example those who bear the cost of these subsidies, and forming strategic alliances with these groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges the value of studies of the kind identified in this recommendation. Indeed, much work has been done, both in United States and elsewhere, on such issues. Some of this work was referred to in evidence before the Committee by the Director of the Centre for International Economics, Dr Andrew Stoeckel (Committee Hansard page 510, 511), who also provided to the Committee a copy of the book "Macroeconomic Consequences of Farm Support Policies", published in 1989 and edited by Stoeckel, Vincent and Cuthbertson. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) also produced a major analysis on the impact of US grains policies in 1989 and is currently doing further work on the effects of the Export Enhancement Program&mdash;an ABARE Issues Paper on this subject was published in the June 1993 issue of the Agricultural and Resources Quarterly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises there may be merit in further studies of this kind. Given the volume of already published material, any additional work which the Government might commission would need to be carefully considered in the light of existing research and in the context of an overall strategy for pursuing our agricultural trade objectives with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the Committee's concern to ensure that these important issues receive greater exposure in the public domain to maximise the impact on US policy makers. This is particularly important given that comprehensive farm legislation will again be considered in 1995 against a background of mounting concern over the size of the US budget deficit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the Committee's proposal concerning formation of strategic alliances with interest groups whose interests coincide with ours. This is already an established element in Government strategy, but there is always scope to refine and expand our activities. We should seek not just to work with traditional allies, but also to identify others, such as environmental or welfare groups whose interests may also be affected adversely by the misallocation of resources through certain farm support programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian industry also has important contacts in the United States and these linkages also contribute to the formation of strategic alliances and coalitions. Some Australian industry groups have embarked on programs to seek to identify and to energise US partners and associated interests to develop a US constituency for the trade relationship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the research level, good linkages already exist between ABARE and US agencies and organisations undertaking research into agricultural economics. There may be scope for developing these linkages further.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.28  Recommendation seven:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government continue to make every effort to promote the rapid achievement of concrete trade liberalising outcomes through APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation is fully consistent with Government policy and the Government welcomes the role which the Committee has played in helping to focus attention on APEC as the preeminent forum for economic cooperation in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC lies at the heart of the Government's strategic approach for Australia's integration into the economic dynamism of the Asia-Pacific region. One of the Government's primary objectives for APEC has been to develop a substantial trade policy agenda, in terms of both an effective policy dialogue and measures to liberalise trade in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional trade liberalisation will continue to be the major focus of APEC in 1994 and beyond. The work program agreed by Ministers in Seattle will be considered by the new Committee on Trade and Investment at its first meeting in Jakarta in January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APEC work program comprises a forward-looking agenda of trade and investment measures including on investment, non-tariff measures, standards and conformance, tariff database, customs as well as a post-Uruguay Round review, measures from the Eminent Persons Group Report and work on small and medium enterprises in the region. This work program embraces a number of ideas advanced by the Prime Minister including on investment, standards and conformance and customs measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministers in Seattle also endorsed the thrust of the report by the APEC Eminent Persons Group. The EPG has been mandated to elaborate further on aspects of its long term vision over the course of 1994 and report again to Ministers in Indonesia next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.29  Recommendation eight:  The Committee recommends that Australia seeks to encourage the further development of APEC as an important tool in reducing the risk of fracture in economic relationships across the Pacific. One specific measure should be the early inclusion of Mexico and Chile in APEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully supports the main thrust of this recommendation with respect to developing APEC as a forum for cooperation and partnership in the region, and as a mechanism for containing and reducing the potential for confrontation and division.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In principle, participation in APEC is open to economies in the Asia Pacific region which have strong regional links and are firmly committed to its objectives. Decisions on the expansion of membership in APEC are taken by consensus.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The APEC Ministerial meeting in Seattle in November agreed that the expansion of membership should not, however, detract from the development of a strong policy focus, particularly on major trade and investment issues. At APEC's current stage of development there is significant merit in placing emphasis on `deepening' the APEC process rather than on `broadening' it too hastily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">APEC members agreed in Seattle to the immediate membership of Papua New Guinea and Mexico, with Chile to join at the Ministerial meeting in November 1994, followed by a three year moratorium on membership to allow APEC to consolidate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.30  Recommendation nine:  The Committee recommends that the Australian Government include in its ongoing dialogue with Japan and China, particularly at the ministerial level, the impact of unilateral trade measures on the region's economic performance. Furthermore, the Committee recommends that the Australian Government lend its good offices to assist the United States, China and Japan avoid any dislocation of the current positive elements of their security and economic relations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has well established mechanisms for regular Ministerial contact with the Governments of Japan, China and the United States. Discussion of trade policy issues plays a major role in our high-level consultations with all three. The Government will continue to use all channels available to it, at bilateral, regional and multilateral levels, to promote the advantages of open, rules-based trading arrangements and cooperative rather than confrontational trade strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over recent years, Australia has been successful in raising the level of our dialogue with Japan to a level similar to that we have with our other most important partners. In addition to frequent Ministerial and senior officials' exchanges, the Australia-Japan Ministerial Committee (AJMC), the most significant forum to facilitate dialogue on Australia's relations with Japan, provides a regular opportunity to canvass bilateral issues at the highest levels. The impact of unilateral trade measures and Australia's concern about managed trading arrangements have been included in these discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the High Level Consultations on Asia-Pacific Cooperation, held in Canberra in February this year, regional economic integration and the implications of regional trading arrangements were discussed in detail. Australia and Japan agreed at those consultations to share the results of studies currently being undertaken into the impact of regional trading arrangements and Japan has welcomed Australia's interest in expanding dialogue on these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been the position of the Australian Government since the early 1980's that Japan should, within domestic and regional constraints and within the context of Japan-United States security arrangements, take on a greater share of the burden of defending itself and contribute to regional security interests. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact that Japan (and also Korea) bear a large share of the costs of forward deployment of US forces should help insulate these deployments to some extent from the pressures to reduce defence spending. Japan contributes around 75 per cent of the non-salary costs of the US forces stationed there (over US$3 billion, equivalent to about 10 per cent of Japan's defence budget), by far the highest contribution of any host nation for US overseas forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has consistently emphasised to Japanese and American interlocutors Australia's concern that the resolution of any tensions in Japan-United States bilateral relations take account of the totality of the relationship, including the crucial security dimension. The Government has also stressed the vital importance that Australia attaches to the maintenance of sound and constructive relations between Japan and the United States as a key element in global stability and economic prosperity. Australia has also sought to encourage Japan to take on a greater share of international responsibilities more commensurate with its economic strength.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of Australia's high-level policy dialogue with the United States is to argue for unconditional MFN status for Chinese imports. Withdrawal of MFN would have an adverse impact on economic reform in China and countries in the region, particularly Hong Kong. Australia's own MFN Trade Agreement with the People's Republic of China should ensure that trade concessions gained by the United States automatically flow to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government response tabled today is a substantial one. It reflects the government's very positive welcome to the Senate's work through the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and its study of the United States election debate a little over a year ago. As one of the senators who contributed substantially to this original report, I take this opportunity to make some comments on the government's response. It was written one year after the original Senate report. The government normally responds within six months to any report of a Senate standing committee. In this case there are probably two reasons why it did not report in that time, although they are not alluded to in the remarks of the government that the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) has just incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, we had an election in March 1993. Effectively, this put us back six months in terms of the government's responding to Senate committee reports. Secondly, there is the quite substantial series of visits that were made by ministers of the government and, indeed, of the parliamentary delegation led by the Speaker. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) visited in September and November 1993. Given three or four of the matters I wish to raise, it certainly seems convenient and timely for the government to make this response after those visits and, in particular, after the Seattle meeting of ministers representing APEC nations in November last year.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I will show, some of the matters which the government needed to respond to were more maturely put in December of last year than the government would have been able to put had it responded earlier than the APEC meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I start by referring to the statement that the government has made in its introduction to the statement tabled today. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomed the Committee's report as a contribution to analysis and public debate on the likely directions of US policy under the new Clinton Administration. The Report, though based on hearings and testimony provided prior to the inauguration of President Clinton, remains relevant in its identification of key issues and their implications for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>In `governmentspeak', that is about as praiseworthy as any government would be towards the work of a Senate committee. It shows that the government values this report of the Senate and has warmly and positively responded to its conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are nine recommendations in the Senate's report. They touch upon the likely direction of US trade policy, US security policy in the Asia-Pacific region, the US-Japan relationship and the US-China relationship. The common thread through it all for us in our inquiry was the implications of these developments within the United States for Australia. The Australian Senate wanted to look at the debate occurring in the months leading up to the presidential election in the United States to see what references were being made to the Asia-Pacific region, what implications from these references there are for Australia, and what steps we ought to take to ensure that our voice is heard and our interests are understood, and that we do not see any deterioration in the United States' positive engagement in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the Senate report was written prior to the election. It looked very seriously at the speeches that were made by the candidates, President Bush, Governor Clinton and Mr Perot. Two basic concerns undergirded our view of the presidential debate. Firstly, with the end of the Cold War, would the United States become more isolationist? Would the disposition of US security engagement in the region change purely as a result of the less pressing circumstances, the Cold War being over? The second concern was the very considerable domestic economic concerns of the US people as reflected in the priorities given in the debates by Governor Clinton and, indeed, his quite explicit first priorities of prosperity, employment and improvement of the economy of the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third area of concern was that with what we felt would be the likely success of Governor Clinton, we would have a person who did not have a marked track record of personal involvement in the Asia-Pacific region&mdash;Japan, China or Australia&mdash;to the extent that had been the case with the much older generation of Presidents Bush, Reagan, Carter, all the way back for some 30 or 40 years. It was this concern that there might be some lapse of the quite considerable US priorities in our region that we wished to address. We analysed the debate in the US, looked at the implications for our region, and came up with various conclusions and these nine recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of Australia has responded very positively to most of those nine recommendations. However, it has made a subdued or even lacklustre response to two or three of them, and it is those that I now wish to refer to. I, of course, welcome the government's acceptance of the great bulk of the committee's findings. The committee's report represents a bipartisan view about the importance of the United States continuing to have a positive role in security and trade in our region and to give full attention to the interests of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The areas of Australian government response that I find inadequate, to some extent, relate to EEP trade subsidies, particularly for wheat, which the United States has so unfairly followed for many years now and which have led to the united protests of every part of the Australian parliament, not least from my colleagues in the Liberal-National parties. I do not wish to be in competition with the government on this matter but I do not find in the government's response&mdash;for instance on page 4&mdash;the kind of urgency and priority that is shown in the government's track record in recent years in putting the view squarely to the United States that the United States has not lived up to its promises to consult with us and to ensure that its EEP does not harm Australia. When such action does, by various escalations, harm Australia, the response of the United States to our protests has been that it was unintended&mdash;`It's not aimed at our good friend Australia'. Although Australia continues to protest, I do not find the appropriate decibels in the following words on page 4:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has registered very clearly with the USA that we are opposed to any form of managed trade or discriminatory bilateral arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>In the paragraphs that follow, whilst rightly opposing managed trade on the part of the United States, I believe we ought to be much more emphatic and consistent in the bipartisan and united approach of the government and the opposition by insisting that there be a definable end to the United States subsidy on wheat and other elements of EEP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 5 there is what could be described as almost a set of excuses. The government of Australia has these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On balance, then, the policy directions of the new Administration&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>talking about President Clinton's now-established government throughout 1993&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">contain much that is consonant with Australian interests. While our differences on some trade issues remain of serious concern, it is inevitable, in a relationship as substantial and broadranging as ours, that some differences will occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those words could be taken literally as reinforcing our close alliance with the United States; but they do not have the right number of decibels about our very serious concern about some trade issues that discriminate against Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue concerns what we in the committee proposed, in part, to do about that. Our recommendations 4 and 6 speak about Australia identifying specific US interest groups which are also harmed by EEP, the subsidies program. The recommendations suggest that we should be pointing out to those interests in the United States that they ought to hear our analysis of this discrimination and ensure that we work together in putting forward the arguments that Australia puts internationally&mdash;arguments which these allied interests within the United States could put domestically. The government's response is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A strategy of this kind, of course, needs to be handled with sensitivity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is Australian Public Service speak for, `We're not going to do this. We wouldn't want to tread on any toes in being so specific in lobbying for Australia's objectives'. I do not think I have this out of context. I ask the government to think about this again and implement the committee's recommendation on this matter, which was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Australian Government pay particular attention to identifying United States' self-interests, and how they may coincide with Australian interests, in any trade proposals or representations we make, both bilaterally and in APEC, and ensuring that the matters identified are widely known within the United States, particularly by potential allies within the United States.</PARA>
<PARA>We have already done this in Europe, I believe with some reasonable success. The green book put the argument for freer trade and for the Europeans to lower their subsidies. It was all a part of our arguments within the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which was concluded late last year; but it was very well listened to amongst a number of interests within Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For several weeks a couple of years ago I happened to be deputy leader of the parliamentary delegation to Strasbourg and Brussels, the European institutions. We had the green book in our hands every day. We were reinforcing as parliamentarians to parliamentarians and to other interest groups in the parliament of Europe, the European Union as it is now known, that the Australian arguments were enormously confirming of the interests of consumer groups for lower prices of goods and even of some of the environmentalists and those concerned with freer trade and a fair go for Third World countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual argument with regard to price was the most compelling self-interest argument that we could put to interest groups within Europe. There is a majority forming, I believe within the parliament in Strasbourg, to endorse the Australian point of view. This needs to be an explicit part of Australia's quite honest, genuine&mdash;there is nothing covert, controversial or conspiratorial about it&mdash;open addressing of our interests, our objectives, by aligning ourselves with interest groups within the United States that agree with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not read recommendation 6 but I note that it refers to seeking to `identify specific interest groups' and so on. I think the government's response on these two recommendations is inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to recommendation 8 which, quite squarely on the evidence that was before the committee, recommended that the Australian government continue to make every effort to promote the rapid achievement of concrete trade liberalising outcomes through APEC, and that one specific measure should be the early inclusion of Mexico and Chile in APEC. Happily, the November meeting of APEC in Seattle admitted Mexico and Papua New Guinea, and agreed to admit Chile from November of 1994, after which there will be a three-year moratorium on membership to allow APEC to consolidate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much welcome the APEC decision. The admission of these three members will be the final admission for the time being. I have to note that it was with some embarrassment to me, personally, as the President of the Australia-Chile friendship group within this parliament, that on the occasion of President Aylwin's visit to this parliament and to the government in this building&mdash;indeed to Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne&mdash;in September or October last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was still to be convinced about that matter with regard to Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a golden opportunity for the Prime Minister to have given a naturally warm welcome to a visiting head of state&mdash;it was the first time the President of Chile had visited this country. It would have been appropriate as Chile had returned to democracy, to an open-door approach to the world economy, to being world competitive and to having a disciplined economy. But when President Aylwin came on such an historic visit it took a little of the edge off when we learned that the Prime Minister was still to be convinced about the admission of Chile, along with Mexico and Papua New Guinea, in the round that was to take place a matter of weeks later in Seattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will concede that the then Minister for Trade, Senator Cook, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, were very much warmer to the positive reasons for Australia advocating Chile's inclusion in that decision. I greatly regret the loss of an opportunity for a totally successful diplomatic closeness at the prime minister to president level that could have been achieved had there been a bit more vision on the Prime Minister's part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government response had been given in September, nearer to the time in which we expect responses in the Senate to our committee reports, I think the government would not have responded as forcibly as it did in December of last year, post Seattle. I have the consolation though that APEC more readily lived up to the Senate committee's aspirations than did the Australian government at that time, with its confused position. I am very glad that the three countries that, most appropriately, were to be members of APEC; Mexico, Papua New Guinea and Chile, are already&mdash;or will be this year&mdash;members. I am very proud that the Senate committee made such a recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last reference is to what is in many ways the most important finding of the Senate committee, and that is recommendation 9, which refers to the United States relations with Japan and China, and the positive role that Australia can play in both those important relationships as an enhancer of harmony and good outcomes in security and trade terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this recommendation&mdash;to which the government very warmly responds&mdash;was brought down, we have seen the development of difficulty and even potential deadlock between the United States and Japan on trade matters. I do not see a parallel risk in security terms. The United States-Japan security treaty is one of the most important defence relationships in the world. I believe it is very much intact. Whatever immaturities there might be from, or unilateral actions taken by, the United States or Japan in their trade conflict, I believe they will not see any ripples widening to in any way change that very important security arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security arrangement is in fact the most important foundation for the security of the peace that has undergirded the north-east Asian region over the last 40 years. On it has been built the prosperity of Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and the increasing prosperity, too, of China. So the importance of the security relationship is undergirding the economic relationships of the region, and the countries that I have just mentioned include our most important trade partners; that is, from Australia's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In security terms, Australia has, as its first ally, the United States. The ANZUS alliance is confirmed on all sides of this parliament, as I understand it&mdash;certainly by the government and the coalition. As recently as an hour or two ago it was confirmed in the statement by the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's security relationship with the United States is another of the foundations for our involvement in the whole Asia-Pacific region, I believe to the better stability of that region, both strategically and in economic terms. Where the crunch comes is that we need coherence on the part of the Australian government and all of its ministers and representatives in defusing these potential difficulties in trade between the United States and Japan, or between the United States and China. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Australia is an honest broker in this matter. Of course we have our self-interest, to see the whole region so stable that it prospers and we prosper along with it. But we do warn against unilateral trade measures on the part of the United States. The role that Australia can play may well be crucial to the continuation of the situation we have been so happy to observe in the last 20 years in our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accidents happen in trade or in security matters. There are unforeseen developments which could have been avoided by reinforcement at an earlier stage. It does mean that Australia needs to live up to the kind of response that the government has made to recommendation 9 in this committee report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by referring to the large number of visits by Australian ministers to the United States in the first year of Mr Clinton's presidency. They have been made very welcome. I have the impression that all these ministers went to the United States with the Senate committee report in their pockets. I say this to commend the government. I think that whilst there have been lapses and a lack of full coherence from Mr Russell and Mr Calvert, our ambassadors in the United States and Japan, and in statements made by ministers back in Australia with regard to last week's developments in Japan-US trade relations, the actual visits of ministers of this government to the United States in the last 12 months have been constructive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am loath in certain circumstances to commend the Prime Minister, I want to give him full credit for the personal rapport which clearly he has established with President Clinton. The demonstration of that is in their joint press conference, in the Prime Minister's reference to NAFTA, and in health policy, quite apart from all the matters that have been the subject of this report. I believe that has helped to build a personal relationship between President Clinton and Mr Keating which is good for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that we should not let events of the last week and our inadequately coherent responses to that take away from the foundation that has been well established in 1993, and which has been so much called for by the Senate report. </PARA>

If one takes those dates into consideration and now looks at the response, one could be forgiven for believing that history has passed the committee report by.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report itself brought down by the committee covered a number of fairly important subjects: the presidential election in the US, APEC and NAFTA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the Senate foreign affairs, defence and trade committee's report on the implications of the United States policy for Australia shows, I believe, in particular, the government's acknowledgment of the contribution that the report made to the analysis and the public debate on the likely direction of the US policy under the new Clinton administration. At the same time, I must express disappointment that the government has taken more than 12 months to put forward its response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, the membership of the committee has changed considerably. I know that Senator Teague is still a member of the committee&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right; he is still on that side of the house. The chairman at the time of the inquiry was the former Senator Maguire. I am sure he would have wished to comment on the government's response. Equally importantly, many significant developments have occurred in the areas canvassed in the report, including APEC, NAFTA and the Uruguay Round. The value of dialogue on the report within the parliament diminishes if too much time passes between the committee's report and the government's response. In all fairness&mdash;and I think Senator Teague made this comment&mdash;I should note that over the past three years the government has been quick and thorough in its response to committee reports and, in this instance, one would have to say that the holding of an election certainly slowed down any response by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From a very quick perusal of the government's response, I am pleased to see the government recognises the broad validity of the committee's analysis of likely developments as the Clinton administration settles in. The response gives a useful account of the way in which the United States' policies have evolved over the past year. I am also pleased to see that a serious effort has been made by the government to develop strong links with the new American administration. This is something that the committee strongly advocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two areas of continuing concern, notwithstanding the successful completion of the Uruguay Round, are the continuing difficulties for Australia arising from the United States agricultural subsidies barrier to Australian exports and the possible adverse consequences arising for Australia from NAFTA. In this regard, I particularly welcome the government's support for the committee's proposal concerning the formation of the alliances with groups whose interests coincide with ours. As the response says, it is important not just to work with traditional allies but also to identify others such as environmental or welfare groups whose interests may also be affected adversely by the misallocation of resources through certain farm support programs. It is to be hoped that adequate resources will be dedicated to identify and link up with new allies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also evident that the government will need to continue to monitor very closely the detailed implication of the NAFTA agreement and take prompt action to bring to the attention of the US government any damage that the practical application of the agreement might inflict on Australia. Finally, the Maguire report certainly shows where Australia stands on some of the issues although, as I said before, I think history has passed the committee report by. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to thank the staff of the committee for the way in which they worked to put together the report and have it tabled in the Senate by 16 December 1992, soon after 16 September 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The charter of the Department of Social Security is to deliver social security entitlements with fairness, courtesy and efficiency. With this in mind, this bill contains a range of omnibus amendments to the Social Security Act 1991 to further refine the Government's carefully balanced income support programs administered under that Act. The bill also provides for the implementation of a 1993 Budget initiative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act currently provides for the payment of mobility allowance to disabled persons who have job search as part of their agreed activity plan but who cannot use public transport without substantial assistance because of their disability. This bill amends the Social Security Act to ensure that disabled persons undertaking job search activities under a Competitive Employment, Placement and Training Program will also qualify for mobility allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Social Security Act, a person does not have to make a proper claim for sole parent pension if the person is receiving a wife pension or a carer pension, the person's partner dies, immediately before the end of the bereavement period the person is qualified for wife or carer pension respectively and immediately after the end of that period the person is qualified for sole parent pension. However, this is not the case for a person in similar circumstances who qualifies for widow B pension. The bill corrects this difference by amending the Act to allow a person to be granted a widow B pension without the need to make a proper claim in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is with much pleasure that I inform the Senate that this bill gives effect to a new international social security Agreement between Australia and the Republic of Italy. The new Agreement follows a review instigated by Australia and encouraged by Australian-Italian community groups and representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act provides that if there is a charge or encumbrance over a particular assessable asset of a person that is not used for primary production, the value of the asset is reduced by the value of that charge or encumbrance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This reduction is not allowed to the extent that the charge or encumbrance is a collateral security or was given for the benefit of a person other than the person or the person's partner. If the charge or encumbrance is over a mix of assessable and exempt assets, it is apportioned between those assets. Assets cannot be reduced by the value of unsecured liabilities and, if a secured liability exceeds the value of the unencumbered asset, the excess is not an allowable deduction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments were made to the Social Security Act in 1991 to allow more generous rules to apply to primary producers by providing that the aggregate value of primary production assets could be reduced by the aggregate value of their liabilities that are related to the carrying on of primary production. This means that the value of their primary production assets can be reduced by the value of their unsecured liabilities, as well as by the amount that a secured liability exceeds the value of the asset that provides the primary security. However, it was always intended that where a liability exists in relation to an asset that is in any part exempt for the purposes of the assets test, then the apportionment rule should apply. This bill gives effect to that intention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act provides for certain assets to be disregarded in calculating a person's assets for the purposes of the pensions and benefits assets tests. One type of asset that is disregarded is a life interest unless it is a life interest in the principal home of the person or the person's partner or it has been created by the person or the person's partner. The intention in not allowing these latter types of life interests to be disregarded was to prevent people from gaining an unfair advantage under the assets test by converting absolute interests in property into a life interest. A recent decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal (SSAT) highlighted a deficiency in the legislation in situations where a life interest is created under the will of a deceased person who, immediately before their death, was the partner of the life tenant. The bill corrects this deficiency to ensure that these life interests will not be disregarded in calculating the value of a person's assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act currently allows the assessable period of a client to be taken into account when the client realises a `saved' non-superannuation investment. Amendments contained in this bill ensure that the assessable period of a non-client partner will also be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act will also be amended to clarify the existing definition of retirement village. This amendment aims at preserving the original intention underlying this definition. It ensures that accommodation primarily intended for  persons who are at an age that is more than 55 years is treated in the same way as accommodation primarily intended for persons who are at least 55 years of age, that is, as accommodation in a retirement village.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes further amendments to the confidentiality provisions of the Social Security Act as part of an ongoing vigilance by the Department of Social Security to safeguard a person's privacy. One of the key amendments relating to confidentiality that is contained in the bill provides for the extension of the definition of "protected information" to protect the information that the Department has no information about a person, for example, that the person is not a client of the Department. A further amendment tackles a loophole in the provisions. At the moment, it is not an offence under the Social Security Act for a person to disclose protected information if that information has been obtained by the person through innocent means&mdash;for example, if a person finds Departmental papers about a client in the street and then tells another person about the details contained in those papers. This bill provides that, should a person obtaining the information know that it is protected information and intentionally record, disclose or otherwise use it, that person will be committing an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A decision by the SSAT must usually be implemented by the Department of Social Security regardless of whether a further appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) is lodged by either the Department or the client. If the SSAT decision is to be delayed in its implementation one of the parties must successfully seek a stay order from the AAT. The Department seeks a stay order when it is unsuccessful at the SSAT and appeals to the AAT in situations where implementation of the decision would be detrimental to the longer term interests of the Commonwealth. A client seeks a stay order where they are unsuccessful at the SSAT, intends to appeal to the AAT, and wish to continue to receive advantages that would cease if the SSAT decision were implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Problems arise where the SSAT has affirmed an original Departmental decision. The decision on appeal to the AAT is then not the SSAT decision. Rather it is the Departmental decision as affirmed by the SSAT. In several cases, the AAT has commented on this as a curious situation because it means that there is no decision of the SSAT's own that it can stay. It is anomalous that Departmental clients in a similar situation could be treated differently by the law depending on whether the SSAT and the Department happened to be in agreement. This bill overcomes this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Social Security Act lists all situations where an overpayment can be described as a "debt due to the Commonwealth" and so be recoverable. At present that list does not include a debt that has arisen because of social security payments made pursuant to an AAT stay order granted at the client's request where the client ultimately loses at the AAT and, with hindsight, it is clear that the money was not payable. As a result, these stay order debts cannot be recovered. This bill amends the Act to add to these debts to the categories of recoverable overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government decided in the 1993 Budget context to abolish, from 1 July 1994, the administrative charge currently applicable under the Social Security Act in relation to certain debts. The administrative charge will be replaced with a penalty interest charge that can be applied to any debt owed under the Act if, and only if, the person who owes the debt, is not a current client of the Department and refuses to enter into an agreement to repay the debt or if, having entered into such an agreement, the person defaults on the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes a number of minor and technical amendments as part of the ongoing exercise to ensure the integrity and accuracy of the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill corrects an unintended consequence of an earlier amendment to the National Health Act 1953 so as to prevent a person who is a dependent of a mobility allowee from attracting concessional pharmaceutical benefits unless the person can attract those benefits otherwise than because they are a dependent of the mobility allowee.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1993 has been a long time in the making. It started some 18 years ago with an Australian Law Reform Commission report. It got a boost along quite a few years after that with the Gibbs committee in 1987. And here we are in 1994 debating a bill that was introduced last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the title indicates, the bill deals with search warrants and powers of arrest. Basically what that means is that it covers the investigatory matters in relation to Commonwealth offences. While you and I, Madam Acting Deputy President, might think this bill is a bit dry and something that only the lawyers would be interested in, a headline in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> indicates just how interested individual citizens should be in the provisions of the bill. In fact, the civil liberties groups, the law societies and the law institutes have taken a significant interest in this bill from a perspective of the rights of individual citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no dispute about the need for such a bill. There may be some, as yet, unresolved disagreement about the terms of the bill. The headline in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> is `Police Probe Footy Park Arrests'. The first paragraph of the article reads:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Police are investigating allegations that two teenage girls endured a 6 1/2-hour ordeal in which they were jailed over an under-age drinking incident at Football Park.</PARA>
<PARA>If these allegations prove to be correct, it is a quite serious matter if teenage girls are deprived of their liberty for 6 1/2 hours. What is alleged to have happened in this incident is that the girls were spoken to by undercover policemen about drinking and asked for identification. When it turned out they were not of age, they were instructed to leave Football Park&mdash;probably a sensible police decision not to pursue them at the time and seek some sort of prosecution later. The girls say that they left Football Park and tried to contact the parents of one of the girls. In any event that was unsuccessful, partly because one girl's parents do not have a phone and the other girl's parents were already on their way to Football Park. The girls tried to ring a friend and were unable to get through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consequence of that was that, not being sure what to do having been instructed to leave, the girls then decided to go back into Football Park because, they say, they knew where the parents of one girl would be. Before they got to the parents, the police who had told them to leave saw them come back, apparently took them to some sort of place for detention, placed them in a paddy wagon and allegedly they were left there for an hour before someone else joined them. And so the saga continued. It was no doubt a very frightening experience for those young girls who would have no idea of their rights and obligations in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see both sides of the story. The police might have thought they were being lenient in saying, `Look, just leave' and then, seeing the girls coming back, might have thought they were being hoodwinked by two young girls who were just saying that their parents were somewhere in the crowd. In any event, a simple thing such as underage drinking&mdash;not that I approve of it by saying that it is simple&mdash;can deprive people of their liberty for quite an extensive period and have significant consequences of apprehension in the family and possibly after that as a consequence of these activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I add in this respect that the South Australian police have not necessarily done anything wrong. These are allegations raised in the newspaper and I believe that there are always two sides to a story. But it highlights what can happen to people. It is important that we realise when we are dealing with legislation in this place that we are not just dealing with bits of paper and laws that someone somewhere else will reflect on in days or years to come but with things that will, on a day-to-day basis, impact on the lives of Australians. I thought that was worth raising in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the other place my colleague Daryl Williams QC, MP raised one practical impact of this legislation as it relates to police officers rather than to citizens from day to day. This act gives the power to state police officers with respect to Commonwealth offences, and the question necessarily arises as to how the police are to decide from one moment to the next which sort of offence they are investigating. Mr Williams used the example of an offence of conspiracy under federal or state law. If the powers in relation to search warrants and powers of arrest are different in this bill for a federal offence than they are in the state bills, that raises a confusion for police officers. Which offence are they alleging to investigate at any one time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The civil libertarians and those who do not want to give the police any more power at all would probably say, `I know what will happen. They will cunningly claim that they were investigating what they thought to be an offence under whichever law gives them the greater power'. That is not the point that Mr Williams was raising, although it may well be made. The point he made relates to the difficulty that is created for police officers in this respect. This bill will have a far-reaching day-to-day impact on a wide range of people: Commonwealth and state police officers and, of course, individuals who might be affected by an investigation or an action having taken place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has a number of divisions. There is obviously a preliminary one dealing with search warrants, and that covers the requirements of issuing of search warrants, including telephone warrants and the powers that can be conferred by them, matters relating to the seizure of property and the use of electronic and other equipment during the execution of a search warrant. Division 3 deals with stopping and searching of conveyances. Division 4 deals with arrest and some related matters. Division 5 is a somewhat general division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might have thought that, because this bill was introduced last year, in early January there would have been a significant amount of comment available on it. That is not, as we have discovered, the case at all. Mr Williams made the point that probably everyone was on holiday at that time, and I think that is true. I think it is true today that Australia generally shuts down over late December early January, but it is a very conscientious volunteer worker for civil liberties, for a law society or whatever who takes the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill home for some light early January reading rather than watching the cricket or whatever. We need to understand that the people who will make contributions to this sort of legislation, other than those who already have done so, are volunteers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We came to the situation where the bill was coming on in the House of Representatives and there was not a very wide range of comment. There clearly needed to be some further investigation&mdash;not as to the principle of having such a bill codifying these powers, but with respect to the individual clauses. Mr Williams sought in the other place to send this bill to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;a proposal which I note was greeted with some agreement by Mr Melham, who happens to be the chairman of that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no remarks as to Mr Melham's ego, but I was amused to read in the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> an explanation that he had been overseas when this bill was introduced and that he did not get the opportunity to see it before it went into the House. This raised two things in my mind. Firstly, I thought how nice it would be to be in government when backbenchers could see bills before they were brought into the house and get a longer period to make a contribution. Obviously, Mr Melham was indicating that he would have had the opportunity to have some input to the bill. Secondly, I thought he was implying that had he seen the bill before, all would have been well. Mr Melham might have waved a magic wand and fixed the concerns raised by Mr Williams and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was good enough to his committee to indicate that it was the premier committee of the parliament&mdash;not of the House of Representatives, but of the parliament. It was the premier committee. I thought this confidence was inspiring and, as I read on, I felt quite sure that the confidence would have been shared by other honourable members of the House of Representatives. But it was not to be. Apparently, the government does not share Mr Melham's confidence in that committee, of which Daryl Williams QC, Ian Sinclair and, I understand, a former Attorney-General or two are members. For some inexplicable reason&mdash;and I am interested, when this debate concludes and the minister responds, to see if we can get some idea what that reason was&mdash;the government decided not to send this off to a Senate committee to do some investigation. Of course, it comes up to this place and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs takes on the task, which is not surprising to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the substance of the bill, there are a number of things that have caused concern. There are always competing arguments, as I said with respect to the matter raised in the Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> this morning. What we have seen so far is the allegations made by the girls or by their parents. It would be interesting to hear what the police have to say. There are concerns raised by, for example, the Law Society of New South Wales. I also note the Public Defenders Office, an office from which, I understand, Mr Melham came. I thought he would be particularly interested to hear what the Public Defenders Office in New South Wales had to say with respect to some of these clauses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is proceeding with the second reading of this bill in this fortnight of sittings. As I understand it, an agreement has been arrived at that the committee stage of the bill will be held Wednesday next&mdash;not Wednesday of this week, but Wednesday next. That, I understand, is to give further time to people who want to get in more views from the people who may have an interest. The Senate standing committee has already done that from a wide range of people, but there are still more who might wish to put their views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the Senate standing committee spoke to Mr Andrew Menzies, who was part of the review of Commonwealth criminal law&mdash;otherwise referred to as the Gibbs committee; it had something to say about this in 1987. The committee also spoke to Mr Martin Sides QC from the Public Defenders Office in New South Wales, Ms Beverley Schurr from the Law Society of New South Wales, Terry O'Gorman from the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties, and Dr Jill Hunter from the University of New South Wales, who is an academic in this area. It is fair to say that none of these people wholeheartedly endorsed the bill. In fact, there was not one of them, apart from the government representatives, who did not raise some concern. I stress that this is not a debate about politics of the Labor Party or the Liberal Party or whatever: it is a desire to try to get this codification right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be useful in the remaining time I have to raise some of the concerns that have been raised by the New South Wales Law Society and, for example, the Public Defenders Office. The committee stage&mdash;which it is agreed will be postponed until Wednesday week&mdash;is where the for and against arguments in each of these matters can be more clearly argued. The Law Society of New South Wales is not, for example, at all happy with police having powers to enter premises without a warrant to arrest. It is simply dissatisfied with that and it queries a number of things. For example, it asks that if someone is not arrested, what are the police powers? The bill is silent as to powers, such as to detain the persons in the premises and to search and seize persons and the contents of the premises. The Law Society of New South Wales goes on to point out how persons may then turn to rely on the common law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the most contentious clause is the creation of an offence for the failure to supply name and address to police. The argument put by the New South Wales Law Society basically is that it may be true&mdash;and I believe it is true&mdash;that by far the greater majority of citizens want, whenever it is possible, to be of assistance to the police. If they have seen something and they think they can contribute, they will. But we have always maintained that it is a citizen's right not to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are plenty of reasons why people do not participate in matters associated with an investigation in an incident that they have seen&mdash;not the least of which is the old fashioned and sometimes regrettable desire not to be involved. There is the fear of the consequences of speaking out. Sometimes there is a fear of reprisal or simply a fear of the time that will be taken in having to give a statement. There is probably the fear of being called into court and cross-examined on what they saw when they were simply innocent bystanders. They were walking along unlucky enough to be the schmucks who saw whatever it was that happened. They would say to themselves, `We are getting out of here. We do not want to know about this. We do not want our time taken up. We cannot take time off our jobs. We would like to help, but forget it'. Some of those people ring up and give anonymous contributions to the police. Others do not; they just put it aside and forget it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause means that if people are there at the time, the police can ask for their names and addresses. It is not only those people who might feel apprehensive about that. I do not see a huge difference, in some respects, in having to have an identification card. I see there is a substantial difference, but I also see the similarities that someone is entitled to just come up and ask people their names and addresses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the easiest way to clarify this for people of older years&mdash;it might not be something that affects people of younger years&mdash;is simply to ask them whether they have ever been at a place, at a particular time, they would rather everyone else not know they were there for whatever reason. I do not need to waste the Senate's time listing the pages and pages of reasons that people might have to be in that position. What happens to these people lawfully going about their business&mdash;doing nothing that we have any business interfering in&mdash;and who are just unlucky enough to be there when a robber runs out of a bank, a car smashes into another car or whatever. Up until now, in most states, and as I understand it, in relation to federal offences, these people could silently slink away into the night or the day, whatever it may be. But that will be no more if this bill is passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons offered are legitimate reasons. Some of those people might feel at the time that they do not want to be involved, et cetera. The police might have an opportunity to persuade them otherwise if they had their names and addresses. That begs the question of what form the persuasion would take. It does, however, raise the very valid point that it gives the opportunity for the police to get back in contact with people and to give them a reminder and an opportunity to reconsider their positions as to whether they want to participate and be of assistance. That comes back to the basic position put by the civil liberties people&mdash;that is, that it is the citizens' choice whether they cooperate with the police or not. It is perfectly valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the reasons offered that would make it easier for the police if all people had to give their names and addresses are quite true. But the point is bypassed that, up until now&mdash;except for a number of things such as traffic offences&mdash;citizens have had that choice. That choice now, we would have to consciously admit to ourselves, would be being taken away from them. The question is whether we want to give the police the power to do that. The second argument with respect to this clause of probably equal, if not greater, standing raised by the civil liberties people and, indeed, by the Public Defenders Office in New South Wales is the opportunity it creates for a misuse of power against minorities and the difficulties that it, therefore, may well create for those minorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People unaware of their rights and obligations and who are, for whatever reason, apprehensive about giving their name and address and who are wanting to slink off into the night, all of a sudden find themselves arrested. It is the age old problem of people being arrested for some minor, piffling offence as a means of securing their custody, either to question them further about something or as a form of harassment or, in many cases, simply as a result of an ill-informed understanding of these people's place in the community and their knowledge of their rights and obligations. That is probably the most serious clause that we need to look at. I do not say at this stage that we will oppose that clause but we are very concerned about its inclusion, as are a number of other people, and it is a matter we will deal with in the committee stage of the debate on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1993. This bill amends the Crimes Act of 1914 to insert a new part which will deal with search warrants and powers of arrest as they apply to the investigation of Commonwealth offences. The bill deals with five substantive areas: the issue of warrants for search and arrest; the procedures for obtaining search warrants for premises and persons; the provision of names and addresses to police officers; the procedures for arrest undertaken with or without warrants; and the collection and use of identification material.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the law currently stands, Commonwealth police must use state powers when dealing with these matters. This leads to great inconsistencies because each state applies different laws to these powers and procedures. The bill's provision will supplant all these state powers in relation to search warrants and powers of arrest with the exception of those relating to forensic samples. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Defence, Senator Ray, made reference to this gap in the law. We have received assurances that the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General is currently working on uniform forensic sampling provisions for all jurisdictions in Australia. We assume that once this position has been reached a further amendment to the Crimes Act will be proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill had its genesis in recommendations made by the Gibbs committee in November 1990. That committee undertook quite extensive community consultation on the issues of search warrants and arrest. The bill is aimed at balancing the competing public interest of effective law enforcement and civil liberties. While recognising that this is a very difficult task, the Australian Democrats believe that the balance has not been found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which heard further evidence from interested community groups, such as the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties and the New South Wales Law Society, as Senator Vanstone mentioned. The submissions from those groups raised many important issues from a civil liberties perspective, which the Australian Democrats believe must be addressed before the bill is finally passed into law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats' proposed amendments fall into four categories: the issue of warrants; the execution of warrants; the name and address provisions; and the identification material provisions. On the matter of the issuing of warrants, we believe that it would be advisable to limit the right to issue telephone warrants to magistrates only. The Australian Democrats believe that only magistrates should be authorised to issue these sorts of warrants&mdash;namely, those obtained in situations of urgency. The decision to infringe a person's privacy and liberty is a serious one. In the case of warrants issued by telephone or other electronic means, the safeguards for abuse of the search powers are greatly reduced. Such warrants should only be granted by those fully trained in the consideration of evidence and the determination of questions of law as they apply to such situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of report-back provisions, the bill provides for very little supervision of the powers it bestows upon the police force. The New South Wales Search Warrants Act 1985 requires police officers to report back in writing to the magistrate or justice of the peace who issued the warrant with the following details: whether the warrant was executed; the result of the search; a description of any seized goods; an explanation in the case of a warrant not being executed; and whether the warrant and occupier's notice were provided to the occupier. The aim of such a report-back procedure is to create a paper trail which an aggrieved occupier is able to trace in order to ascertain whether there has been any abuse of the search powers. It also provides a mechanism for detecting forum shoppers&mdash;police officers who approach various issuing officers to obtain a warrant. The Democrats would like to see such reporting mechanisms in this bill, preferably computerised in a central search register. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of disclosure of additional information in the warrant application, the bill provides for various types of information which the executing officer must give to the issuing officer when applying for the search warrant. For example, it may be necessary to use firearms, which is a somewhat topical issue. Given that the bill allows for premises to be entered in certain circumstances without any announcement to the occupiers, we believe that if a police officer has a suspicion that this might be necessary at the time when he or she applies for the warrant, it should be disclosed to the issuing officers. Similarly, it is also essential for the police officer to inform the issuing officer whether a warrant for the same person or premises has been applied for on any previous occasion. This will help to mitigate the use of forum shopping, which I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of disclosure of additional information on the face of the warrant, given that the potential use of firearms must be disclosed in the application for a warrant, we believe that that fact should also appear on the face of the warrant. Similarly, if the need for entry without announcement is anticipated, that also should appear on the face of the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Civil liberties organisations have expressed concern about the fact that fingerprinting on premises is automatically authorised when a search warrant is issued. In order to curtail the indiscriminate use of this power, the Australian Democrats propose that this is another power which should be stated clearly and overtly on the face of the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of the execution of warrants, in particular to the tape recording of the search. The Australian Democrats support the call of civil liberties groups for the tape recording of all search procedures. That would provide an important safeguard against the abuse of the suspect's rights. We will therefore move an amendment to that effect during the committee stage of this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter of searches to be conducted in the presence of the occupier. We believe that searches of premises should be carried out in the presence of the occupier at all times in order to minimise the opportunities for police to plant evidence. To make this practicable, rooms should be searched one at a time with all persons present. The bill presently gives an occupier the right to be present for the examination of `things containing electronically stored information which have been seized and removed from the premises'. We do not believe that this right should be limited to a specific class of goods and we will move an amendment to extend this right to all goods removed from premises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the police should give the occupier a notice which clearly states the powers that the warrant affords the police, as well as the rights that the various amendments which we will be moving would ensure that the occupier has, namely: the right to be present during a search; the right to have a receipt for goods seized; the right not to be strip-searched; the right to be present at any examination of goods taken from the premises; and the name of the local court where the warrant and report-back information have been lodged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the name and address provisions. The bill makes it an offence for a person to refuse to give his or her name and address or a false name and address if a police officer believes on reasonable grounds that the person may be able to assist an inquiry in relation to any&mdash;and I emphasise any&mdash;offence which has been committed. We believe that this provision is cast far too broadly and should only apply in relation to inquiries about indictable offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of identification material, the Commonwealth bill does not lay down procedures for any intimate forensic sampling. In an effort to bridge this gap, the bill expressly preserves all state and territory laws relating to the taking of all forensic samples, including the non-intimate identification material which the Commonwealth bill lays down in provisions. As a result, it vests a discretion in AFP members as to whether they can use state fingerprinting laws or Commonwealth laws. The Australian Democrats will remove this discretion in relation to non-intimate identification materials such as fingerprints. One of the reasons we believe extra care should be taken in this area is the draconian Victorian legislation which has recently been introduced. Turning to the area of identification material, the Commonwealth bill does not make express provision for the informed consent of the person who may be asked to submit to the procedures. We believe that where a person refuses to provide that consent after he or she is fully informed of his or her rights, then that identification material should not be available unless a court order is obtained by the police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current provisions for destruction of old identification material are not strict enough, in our view. This is one area where the Victorian legislation actually provides better safeguards, and thus we propose to bring the Commonwealth provisions into line with the Victorian legislation. The bill allows a court or jury to draw any inferences it thinks proper from a suspect's refusal to participate in an identification parade. This is not currently a provision in the common law, and marks a serious intrusion on the normal presumption of innocence. It, effectively, forces people to participate in identification parades, even though there is the alternative available to police of a photographic identification parade, which they may turn to at any stage. We will, therefore, move an amendment to withdraw this provision from the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments, and several others, aim to make the police more accountable in their use of the powers which the bill confers. Furthermore, they will provide safeguards to the individual who may have his or her privacy seriously intruded upon by any unauthorised use of these powers. We shall also propose that any police person who exceeds the act's powers shall be subject to disciplinary procedures. In this area I refer to a position we have consistently advocated, which is the need for independent tribunals to deal with complaints against police. The current provision which obtains in most states is that we have a police disciplinary unit to which people must complain when they feel they have reason to have concern about any actions of police. Clearly, the principle of complaining to Caesar about Caesar is not acceptable in a proper judicial system, and it is an issue we will continue to pursue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset, there are some very good things in this Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill. It seeks to clarify the position in relation to the Australian Federal Police. I take on board the comments of Senator Spindler in relation to the fact that various pieces of legislation apply around the country from state to state because the Australian Federal Police act under the various state provisions applicable thereto. In that sense, the bill would no doubt serve to enhance the operations of the Australian Federal Police force and it certainly lays down with some clarity procedures to be adopted. To that extent, this is a desirable piece of legislation. The setting out of how warrants are to be obtained, the search of premises&mdash;all of those aspects have been covered and in a way in which perhaps other pieces of legislation in this country have not endeavoured to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does fall short in one or two aspects. I take on board the comments made by Senator Vanstone and Senator Spindler. In particular, the provision which causes me some concern is proposed new section 3ZK(3)(b), which deals with the refusal of a suspect to take part in an identification parade. As has been stated, should that happen, then the court or jury may draw such inferences from that refusal as appear proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a basic tenet of our law that a person is innocent until proven guilty and that when questioned by the police a citizen of this country does not have to say anything. Above all, there is a rule against self-incrimination. If a person chooses not to say anything to the police, says, `I have no comment', goes to trial and declines to give evidence, then it still cannot be put to the jury that that is something from which that jury can infer guilt. That is an absolutely classic tenet of our criminal judicial system in this country. But what this proposed new section would purport to do would be to allow the jury to draw an inference. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . such inferences from that refusal as appear proper . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, what, indeed, is `proper' to infer from that? One might never know the condition in which the suspect was brought to the police station, the condition in which the suspect was arrested, as opposed to when the offence was committed. The person, when offered to participate in an identification parade, might be in an unkempt condition, and for all manner of reasons might not want to participate in an identification parade. To that extent, it is absolutely wrong to place that person under an onus to participate in an identification parade. That cuts across the basic tenet of our judicial system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill provides that if a person does refuse to do that, there might be identification carried out by way of photograph. For my part, an identification parade carried out properly is an adequate form of identification to be supervised and conducted by the police, because all too many cases have involved the way in which photographs have been put to witnesses. I note that this bill attempts to set out how those photographs are to be put to any witness or complainant. That is highly desirable, but I do not think one has to attach the sanction that if someone refuses an identification parade, then the jury can draw whatever inference it considers proper. That is a grave problem with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take on board the comments made previously in relation to this provision, bearing in mind, of course, that we can say to a citizen, `Look, if you don't participate in this identification parade you will have inferences drawn either for or against you, but, at the same time, you don't have to say anything when questioned by the police'. There is an absolute inconsistency there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to other provisions in the bill, one which I know caused some concern to witnesses who appeared before the committee was clause 3F(1)(b), being the provision which said that a warrant could authorise the searching for and recording of fingerprints found at the premises. I am aware that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) wrote a letter saying that it was not intended to include the taking of fingerprints from people at the premises. I want to make it very clear at the committee stage that that is exactly what that subclause means. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to say thank you to a number of people in Europe. As honourable senators may know, it was my great privilege on 5 and 6 February this year to represent our nation in the world championships of the one-man bobsled, or skeleton as it is known in Europe. The world championships this year were held in the small town of Altenberg, or more precisely the Bergstadt of Altenberg in the Ostliches Erzgebirge in what used to be East Germany. Altenberg is a small town of about 3,000 people close to the German-Czech border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sign of the times that just two years ago the road from Dresden to Altenberg, a major road, was a cobbled street. It is now a sealed bitumen road. But that isolation has in no way diminished the hospitality of the good people of Altenberg. I should make it very clear at the start that Altenberg is not, and I do not think the people of Altenberg would wish it to be known as, a rich town. Historically it has been a mining town, as its name would suggest, and the people who live there are very proud descendants and inheritors of a mining tradition which stretches back hundreds of years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The track at Altenberg is one of the most technically demanding tracks in the world, and that is what made for a good race. But what made for a really good race was the incredible effort that was put in by everybody associated with the organising committee. I suppose in singling out the Organisationsleiter, Herr Eberhard Roesch; the Gesamtleiter, Herr Wolfgang Landt; and the Bahnleiter, Herr Ulrich Hahn, I do a disservice to the many other men and women who freely gave of their time to make sure that the track and the race were everything that we could possibly hope for. Many people&mdash;for example, the track announcer Ron Ringguth&mdash;gave their time and asked for absolutely nothing in return. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What impressed me was the opening ceremony to the world championship. I have been at a number of world cups and world championships over about five years and this one was the most touching and moving of all. Every athlete, coach and official participated in an opening ceremony march that started near the Altenberg railway station and proceeded to the town square. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were escorted through the street of this beautiful town by men in traditional costume from the Erzgebirge region and by school children carrying flaming torches as we marched through the night. I will never forget my surprise and amazement as we went down the main street and swung into the town square where there were well over 1,000, maybe 2,000, of the town's 3,000 inhabitants crammed into the town square to greet us, and my immense pride at being the first of the athletes, coming from Australia, to enter the town square with the honour of having my name read out as a representative of my nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That welcome was just the start of an evening of festivities that included a dinner at which every one of the athletes and officials was a welcome guest, and where the food was everything that one could possibly imagine. As an athlete who had spent five or six weeks in Europe eating bread rolls and sausages, the sight of meat, fish and lobster in abundance was just wonderful. We were presented with participants' medallions and team captains' medals. We were entertained by a local dance troupe, an acrobatic company and a world champion in tumbling and acrobatics who did feats on a bicycle, mounted on a stage less than half the space of this Senate chamber, that left the mind boggling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular I remember the individual in question, a very brave man, sitting on the handlebars of the bicycle facing backwards and pedalling the bicycle on its back wheel whilst making it pirouette on the spot. Everybody was very impressed and very touched by this moving tribute. I remember saying later to one of the organisers that it was the most impressive reception that we had ever seen and that we were really touched. He said, `You are athletes as these people are athletes, and that is a beautiful thing'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say two thankyous, first of all to the Prime Minister of the free state of Saxony, Professor Kurt Biedenkopf, who attended the race and the ceremonies, and especially to the very gallant Mayor of Altenberg, Burgermeister Herr Thomas Kirsten. He is the only mayor to have opened a world championships in one-man bobsled by doing an opening run from halfway down the track. I think he deserves our congratulations. He certainly won the admiration and respect of all the athletes for his courage in doing that, and I think the manner in which he was received by the athletes, spectators and officials at the closing ceremonies was a tribute to the high respect in which he is held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I congratulate the world champion this year, my friend Gregor Staehli from Switzerland; the runner-up, Andy Schmid from Austria, who retires this year after 12 years of world cup and world championship competition; and the third placegetter, Franz Plangger, also from Austria. Congratulations, too, to my very good friend of many years, Christian Auer, who won the world cup overall this year.

About five years ago he contacted Comcare to say that he thought something was wrong with the amount that he received. Not a lot happened after that, but it turned out that he was right.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you regarding your compensation benefit which is paid by the Comcare direct payments system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I heard about this, I found it extraordinary that my constituent was told that he would not get any interest on the money that he had not received over that period. My constituent really did not make a great deal of fuss. I think I would have made more fuss had I been in his position. So I wrote to the state manager and referred to the correspondence which I had seen. I asked whether or not, given that the Australian Taxation Office demands very high interest from anybody who is a bit late in paying, there was any way in which an ex gratia payment could be made to him. Of course, I was not for a minute suggesting that Comcare was liable to pay interest but, from what I know of this matter, it seemed to me that it would be the right thing to do to offer to pay interest to him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a reply from Comcare which is very precise and to the point. It notes the comments, and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comcare is governed by the Commonwealth Employees Rehabilitation and Compensation Act. It has no provision to pay interest. In fact, the only place in which it is required to pay interest is where a lump sum has been delayed by more than 30 days.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that, it is obviously the intention that no interest should be paid in any other circumstance.</PARA>
<PARA>I was disappointed, though, that Comcare, after receiving my letter, had not made a submission to the minister suggesting that perhaps in these circumstances an ex gratia payment for the interest might have been offered to my constituent. But that was not to be. So I raise the matter here tonight. There must be others in the same position. I find it hard to believe that, after this extensive inquiry, this particular constituent was the only one who received moneys that had been withheld from him, through no fault of his, of course. I am not suggesting it was anybody's fault, but it was in fact money withheld from him. Living on money from Comcare is not that easy, according to most of the constituents that I hear about who have dealings with it. It is fairly lean. The amount owed to my constituent over five years was fairly considerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that, if people are late in paying the tax office, the rate of interest they will be charged is 16 per cent. That rate is pretty high these days, considering that interest rates have come down as they have. If one happens to be non-custodial parents required to make payments to the Child Support Agency, and if per chance one should happen to be a little late with those payments, one will be charged 16 per cent. Again, that is a very high rate of interest considering the level of interest rates these days.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is appropriate that, in circumstances such as those I have described to the Senate this evening, the minister should consider making an ex gratia payment to a person who has suffered in the way that I have mentioned. I am not suggesting that interest should be paid at a rate of 16 per cent but, if it is not 16 per cent, I think we are entitled to ask why the tax office and the Child Support Agency do charge for late payments at that rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the minister will perhaps refer this to the relevant minister. I have not mentioned my constituent's name; it is not relevant. I hope to hear from the minister and be invited to submit this case. I hope that the matter will be looked into with a view to considering making an ex gratia payment, bearing in mind that an amount of nearly $15,000 was withheld over a period of five years from someone who was entitled to it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australian Construction Services did build a dog kennel compound for the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service's Quarantine Detector Dog Program at its Training Centre at 160 Curtin Avenue, Eagle Farm.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. Proposals for logging of forests listed on the national estate are submitted each year by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission for approval by the Minister for Resources in conjunction with his consideration of annual export licences. The consideration of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission proposals in 1992, at the same time as the launch of the National Forests Policy Statement, was coincidental.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. The then Minister for Resources, the Hon Alan Griffiths MP, received comments from the Australian Heritage Commission on 23 December 1992 on proposed forest operations in national estate areas in Tasmania in 1993, including advice on the impact of operations on wilderness values in Western Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Mr Griffiths issued licences for the export of woodchips from Tasmania to three companies on 31 December 1992. In deciding to issue export licences the Minister considered the advice provided by the Australian Heritage Commission. He concluded that there were no prudent and feasible alternatives to approving operations in the national estate areas and that adverse effects of logging in these areas would be minimised by adherence to harvesting codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Several of the forest operations approved for 1993 were for new operations. These were all part of the normal planning for long term sustainable production of sawlog and veneer log from Multiple Use State forests under Tasmania's Forests and Forest Industry Strategy and the Forestry Commission's Three Year Wood Production Plans. Due to the high rainfall in these forests it is normal for roading and logging to be concentrated in the drier summer months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In December 1993, the Hon Michael Lee MP, the then Minister for Resources issued licences for the export of woodchips from Tasmania in 1994 which included material sourced from national estate areas in the Great Western Tiers and the Tarkine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Parts of the Great Western Tiers and the Tarkine are entered on the Register of the National Estate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The extension of Riveaux Road was included in the operations in national estate areas during 1994 approved by Mr Lee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) No. Commonwealth Ministers take their obligations under the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 very seriously. The advice of the Australian Heritage Commission has not been ignored. Where there are no prudent and feasible alternatives to proposed harvesting operations in national estate areas, the Minister includes conditions in the licences in order to minimise adverse effects of operations on the national estate. In issuing the 1994 licences the then Minister for Resources, the Hon Michael Lee MP, also wrote to the licensees informing them that he had forwarded the Australian Heritage Commission comments to the Tasmanian Minister and indicated that the companies should liaise with the Tasmanian Forestry Commission to ensure that adverse impacts on the national estate are minimised.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is little factual information on the impact on agricultural production that would result from a 100 per cent conversion to organic production methods in Australia, although I am informed that a number of studies are currently being conducted by various State Departments of Agriculture that relate to production levels associated with organic production methods.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some estimate of the impact of a 100 per cent conversion to organic production methods may be obtained by examining the importance of agricultural chemicals to Australian agriculture. This was addressed by the Report of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals. The Senate Select Committee, although not arriving at a definitive figure, reported that "farm chemicals have a significant beneficial economic impact on Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Data for Commonwealth funding of agricultural research and development is not collated on the basis of organic versus other production methods. Hence the information required to answer the honourable senator's question is not readily available and I regret that I am unable to provide an accurate response to this part of his question. I am informed however, that the Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation is assembling available information on the issue and I undertake to provide the Honourable Senator with that information as soon as it is available to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3 &amp; 4) In relation to pesticide policy in Australia, the National Strategy for Ecologically Sustainable Development contains a number of objectives that relate to agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Objective 1.5 of the Strategy calls on Governments to assess the merits of setting indicative targets for the use of selected agricultural and veterinary chemicals. This issue was considered by the Australian Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Council who referred the matter to the first meeting of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Policy Committee, held in November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agricultural and Chemicals Policy Committee agreed with the need to monitor international policy developments regarding pest and disease management such as those of the Nordic countries. While it is correct that countries such as Sweden have targeted a 50 per cent reduction in agricultural pesticide use in the 1990's, it must be noted that it is not always in Australia's best interests to adopt similar policies. The key issue for consideration in the assessment of national targets in Australia, is one of improved pest and disease management, and as pesticide reduction is only one aspect of improved management, it is inappropriate to consider it outside of this context. The Agricultural and Veterinary Policy Committee also considered that the National Registration Authority's proposed Existing Chemicals Review Program which is due to commence in the first half of 1994, was the most appropriate forum for assessing the need to reduce the use of selected agricultural and veterinary chemicals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice received from the ABC:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The value of resources is $286.526 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) For 1993-94 the projected estimate is $292.69 million. The 1994-95 figure is subject to a new financial funding agreement currently being negotiated with Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) In the case of Australia Television International (ATV), no ABC free-to-air service resources are redirected to ATV operations; however, access is made available to the service for such resources as underutilised satellite capacity and raw program material including News and normal programs. Such access has no effect on the free-to-air application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No ABC free-to-air resources will be redirected to the ABC's participation in Pay TV. The terms of the Government decision on ABC involvement in Pay TV included that activities be undertaken on a commercial basis with no further calls on Budget funding, and that there be no detriment to the ABC's free-to-air services. Detailed arrangements are currently being developed to implement the Government's decision, including provision for a transparent charging and accounting regime to further safeguard the ABC free-to-air services. Common use of certain facilities at no detriment to their free-to-air application will be technologically possible and appropriate. This includes the use of Trans Pacific satellite capacity, interconnection with the integrated BASYS news data network; integration with the voice data network; use of the domestic satellite interchange facilities; access to raw originated ABC vision material and ABC domestic and international correspondents; access to ABC news and program libraries and general information resources. Such access will operate in accordance with the charging and accounting regime being developed and will not in any way diminish the effectiveness or attribution of fixed facilities and resources in their day to day free-to-air application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The independence, quality and availability of the ABC's free-to-air television service will continue unabated with the advent of Pay TV. The ABC envisages that Pay TV will supplement its free-to-air services by permitting programming on a more specialised and extended basis in such areas as news, children's, documentary and cultural programming, including drama and comedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) (a) The estimated annual operating cost of Licence C is commercially confidential. However, the ABC has advised it has calculated the full operational cost for the delivery of two channels comprising news and information programming for one channel and children's, documentary and cultural material for the other as separate, stand alone operations reflecting the arm's length costing and charging arrangements as independently determined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The ABC indicated it intends to meet the operational cost by way of capitalisation of the service comprising a mixture of cash contribution via the $12.5 million start-up-grant allocated in the current financial year by the Commonwealth, allocation of back catalogue from ABC resources and financial partnership with investors meeting the capitalisation costs of the service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has estimated the external capitalisation requirements of the service at approximately $50 million by way of combination of equity and debt predicated on conservative penetration rate assumptions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) The ABC's planning activities for the delivery of subscription broadcast services commenced in 1991. The ABC has indicated that the planning encompasses comprehensive preparation on such issues as corporate structure and control; regulatory matters; programming; financing; accommodation; facility development; technology standards and transmission requirements; and corporate management issues relating to business strategies, staffing and systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC has advised that, in the course of the planning process, it has developed a financial model, running to some 50 mega bits in size, which charts the general financial scope for the whole of the Pay TV system and that component attributable to ABC related services. The ABC considers that the model sets out a conservative base for the operation of the system which is written in constant prices and is fully functional for changes in any significant revenue or expense items. The ABC has indicated that the model has been constructed on a fully integrated basis at monthly rests, with supporting schedules for all principal revenue and expense categories.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The area offshore from the west coast of Cape York lies within the Gulf of Carpentaria. There is presently one offshore petroleum exploration permit held in this area&mdash;permit Q/22P, held by Comalco Aluminium Ltd (Comalco). Since the permit was awarded in 1990, Comalco has completed 2657 kilometres of seismic data acquisition and the permit area is continuing to be actively explored.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only limited exploration drilling has been undertaken in the Gulf of Carpentaria and to date no significant hydrocarbon shows have been encountered. In 1961, minor hydrocarbon shows were encountered in shallow sediments in two wells drilled on Mornington Island in the southern part of the Gulf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the Duyken No. 1 well was drilled in a water depth of 59 metres, to the west of permit Q/22P and on the Northern Territory side of the Gulf. The section drilled was not entirely as predicted, indicating that further exploration was required for a better understanding of the geology underlying the Gulf. The well failed to find hydrocarbons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1989, Phoenix Resources Company of Australia undertook a geophysical survey of the area north of permit Q/22P. The seismic data obtained showed that an undrilled sedimentary basin, the Bamaga Basin, underlies the Jurassic-Cretaceous Carpentaria Basin.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the Gulf of Carpentaria was held under exploration permit in the early 1980's. During this period, the Gulf was explored with geophysical surveys, mainly at a reconnaissance level. This exploration provided fair seismic resolution of the younger sediments (the Carpentaria Basin sequence). Geophysical surveys were also carried out prior to 1980, but the data are of poor quality and of little use for hydrocarbon exploration.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) In December 1991 the then Minister for Transport and Communications published a draft Telecommunications National Code following extensive consultations amongst relevant Commonwealth Departments, the carriers, potential second carriers, State, Territory and Local Authorities and AUSTEL.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carriers have been required to observe this draft code from that time. The draft code has been working effectively by facilitating the rapid roll-out of network infrastructure, while ensuring the carriers are environmentally responsible. There has been minimal public criticism of the way the carriers have complied with the draft Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concurrently with publishing the draft Code, the then Minister for Transport and Communications requested AUSTEL to hold a public inquiry to facilitate discussion on the draft Code and to provide feedback to the Government on the comments received.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AUSTEL reported to the then Minister for Transport and Communications on the draft Telecommunications National Code in September 1992. AUSTEL noted that a large number of those who commented found the wording of the draft Code legalistic and difficult to understand. Bearing in mind the need for the Code to be understandable to the community at large, AUSTEL suggested that the Code be redrafted in plain English, in a manner that recognises the need for precision. The Government accepted the suggestion in AUSTEL's report but this has required extensive reworking of the Code, including further lengthy consultations with the carriers and the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency (CEPA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further factor contributing to the delay in finalising the Telecommunications National Code was the decision of the Parliament in May 1993 to amend the Telecommunications Act 1991 to provide for a code of conduct to regulate the carriers' use of land access powers, provided to them under Part 7 of the Act. The code of conduct was seen as a desirable safeguard at the time the general carriers' land access powers were extended to mobile carriers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are conceptual and procedural similarities between the Land Access Code and the Telecommunications National Code: both provide for safeguard mechanisms to operate in place of other established legislative frameworks; and both are characterised by requirements for consultation, regulation and consultation. Consequently there was a need to ensure both Codes interrelated and were mutually compatible.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Extensive consultations on the Land Access Code were required with the carriers, AUSTEL, and the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman. These consultations have now been completed. Both codes of conduct are therefore now in the final stages of redrafting. It is expected that the revised National Code and the Land Access Code will be available for tabling in the Autumn 1994 sittings.</PARA>
