A set of videotapes of the conference is also tabled to provide a permanent audiovisual record of the proceedings. The conference was held in Canberra on 10 and 11 August and was attended by nearly 100 people, including senior public servants, past and present, academics, consultants, unionists, journalists and other parties interested in commenting on the impact of the public service reforms of the last decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has had a longstanding interest in the field of public service administration and resolved, under its standing reference on central administration of the Australian government, to undertake a review of the most significant report on public service reform to be published this decade, the review of the MAB-MIAC task force on management improvement, entitled<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Australian Public Service Reformed</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms of the previous decade have been numerous and&mdash;in a climate characterised by decentralisation, devolution, and diversity&mdash;have involved structural reforms, industrial reforms, human resource management reforms, financial and budgeting reforms, commercial reforms and planning and reporting reforms, all of which have been aimed at achieving increased efficiency and productivity. As I said at the conference, some of the changes and their consequences have saddened me considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sought to assess the impact of these reforms, but chose to approach the inquiry in a more flexible, less formal way than the traditional public hearing process. Arrangements were made with the Centre for Research in Public Sector Management to jointly conduct the conference. The results of that process are contained in the two volumes of the committee's report&mdash;volume 1 contains the papers provided by the speakers to the conference and volume 2 contains the transcript of proceedings. Whilst most of the papers were made available during the conference, some authors have submitted amended copies of their papers for publication. Others who did not provide papers for the conference have since submitted them. </PARA>

<PARA>Earlier this year a comprehensive analysis of desertification was undertaken, entitled `Desertification&mdash;Exploding the Myth'. United Nations propaganda has been exposed by authors David Thomas, a dryland geomorphologist from the University of Sheffield, UK, and Nick Middleton, desert researcher and science writer from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, as being part of an institutional myth created by the United Nations for the United Nations. They claim that repetition and publicity have developed the institutional myth into institutional fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thomas and Middleton examine and expose the myth of the `global process of desertification' as eco-bureaucratic politics which has misused science to create a global environment issue which in reality exists only on a much smaller scale. This is just a sample of what they had to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of scientific foundation of early quantification attempts, doubts surrounding the conceptualisation of desertification as the advancing desert front, and the lack of clarity of the processes involved have not prevented politicians from using information based on these approaches to indicate the severity of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Scientists have questioned the developing myths but it is not until now that their voices have begun to be widely heard and increasingly accepted above the clamour created by the United Nations Environment Program publicity machine.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the fifth negotiating session in Paris for the Elaboration of an International Convention to Combat Desertification in Those Countries Experiencing Serious Drought and/or Desertification, Particularly in Africa, the Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee on 17 June 1994 adopted the final text and advanced text of two resolutions on interim arrangements and urgent action for Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Annexes to the convention will apply to affected regions, initially Africa, but will also include Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean and North Mediterranean regions. Australia, as an affected developed country, along with other developed countries similarly affected, will not receive assistance but will be expected to provide assistance as set out in the terms of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, indicated in a press release dated 22 June 1994 the Australian government's intention to sign this convention in October of this year. Fifty countries are required to ratify the convention before it can enter into force. This is not anticipated to occur until 1996. However, one of the resolutions passed for Africa calls for a sixth session of the committee to be held in January 1995 and appeals to governments and organisations to make voluntary contributions to extrabudgetary funds to support interim arrangements&mdash;including continuation of existing programs&mdash;pending entry into force of the convention, that is, prior to the convention becoming legally binding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992 the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development held in Rio de Janeiro&mdash;mandated by UN General Assembly resolution 44/228 in December 1989&mdash;identified desertification as a global environmental issue in chapter 12 of agenda 21. Following cabinet approval, agenda 21 was signed on behalf of Australia by the former environment minister, Ros Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action itself in 1992 was criticised strongly in a report by the Centre for International Economics commissioned by key industry groups, including the Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Australian Industry. The report warned the government against signing agenda 21 because of hidden dangers in the 800-page text containing hundreds of policy initiatives and activities, many of which were likely to have important implications for domestic policy. The report recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at the very least Australia would need to assert that it reserves the right to evaluate each of the hundreds of suggested initiatives and actions through the proper domestic policy process before agreeing to their introduction. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">not to do so would amount to an abrogation of the principles of democratic process in favour of rule by international bureaucrats.</PARA>
<PARA>Agenda 21 is a framework plan with political commitment to pursue a set of goals. It is soft law, that is, not a legally binding document; and, as such, Australia is under no obligation to sign this convention. Chapter 12, which is included in section 2, `Conservation and Management of Resources for Development', is directed to `combating desertification and drought'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 Alan Boyle, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Journal of Environmental Law</EMPHASIS>, wrote that some scepticism regarding the actual performance of the institutional model was appropriate. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, many of the institutions created to fulfil this fiduciary role have proved disappointingly inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their basic weakness has tended to be an inability to reach agreement on difficult issues or to ensure the full participation of all the states most closely concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Boyle described the move to allow the majorities of states to impose regulations on dissenting minorities as `radical'. This is at odds with Senator Evans's thinking when he said, during an address to the Queensland branch of the Australian Institute of International Affairs in 1990, that the approach to international environmental issues is `an integral part of the broader foreign policy interests we have in being&mdash;and being seen to be&mdash;a good international citizen.' He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Global cooperation is not some idealistic indulgence but a pressing necessity. . . environmental problems, if unchecked, could threaten our security.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that this was to justify `the imperative to help resolve global and regional environmental problems.' This is all well and good but, as Boyle pointed out, only the European Economic Community has moved in this direction and the results, to say the least, have been questionable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 July this year Radio National broadcast an interview with an Irish farmer, Allan Wallis, who claimed that a breach of an EEC directive to leave paddocks lie fallow for 10 years could be detected by satellite imaging, exposing farmers to criminal charges. Could this happen here? Do Australian farmers want a UN committee based in New York telling them when to plant, what to plant and which paddocks to leave lying fallow? I suspect not, and let me suggest that the answer of those farmers would most certainly be a resounding no. In the same speech Senator Evans stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . within the Environment Assistance Program I have approved a supplementary contribution of $300,000 to the United Nations Environment Programme above and beyond our current core contribution to UNEP of $340,000.</PARA>
<PARA>Seventy thousand dollars of these funds were identified for desertification control to deploy Australian expertise in the prevention of land degradation in South-East Asian countries. These were 1990 figures, but the question remains: if we are already providing this aid, why do we need this convention? In 1987 the World Convention on Environment and Development noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a growing need for effective international cooperation to manage ecological and economic interdependence. Yet at the same time, confidence in international organisations is diminishing and support for them is dwindling.</PARA>
<PARA>This push to have international bureaucracies deal with environmental problems may only result in more costs, divisive debate and increased tensions over national sovereignty, and serve to unnecessarily politicise technical issues and allow individual governments to avoid responsibilities for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Keating government has not yet completed its environmental agenda at the national level&mdash;for example, the national rangeland strategy. The Rio Earth Summit and its outcomes have been considered by many as a salve to the global environmental conscience. This Labor government has used international fora to comprehensively extend and radically transform domestic politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested by legal academic Colin Howard that the biodiversity convention already ratified by Australia creates the power for the government to legislate for rural land management control, given the broad definition of biodiversity under that treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a paper entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">UNCED and the External Affairs Power</EMPHASIS>, Howard claimed that implementation of the biodiversity convention would `comfortably cover the nationalisation of farming, or at least total government control of land use for pastoral and agricultural purposes'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the credibility of desertification as a matter of global environmental concern been questioned but the credibility of UNEP itself has been questioned. Its agenda appears to have more to do with African aid than global environmental concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many Australians, including me, have compassion for Africa, most recently for the horrific tragedy taking place in Rwanda, we should not confuse what is fundamentally an aid issue, quite possibly appropriate for Africa but inextricably linked to the global ecobureaucracy, with rural land management and environmental issues which may be inappropriate for Australia. The signing of this convention creates the link for this to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of using Australia's strength in contributing via an exchange of technology for the global good by means which would allow for some attempt at democracy, the government, with one flourish of a pen, exposes Australia to a regime which not only undermines its sovereignty and converts land management from a state issue to a federal issue but also subjects its citizens to unknown potential dangers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is done without conferring with other than eight so-called experts who comprised the Australian delegation. The Australian delegation's role in the negotiations was to protect Australian interests within ministerially approved guidelines. Did the Australian delegation consider the efficacy of Australia's participation at all in this convention?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treaties are not necessarily bad. Australia has derived benefits from many bilateral and multilateral treaties. Executive privilege used wisely is a useful tool for government. What is offensive, however, is the Labor government's persistent abuse of the external affairs power under section 51(xxix) of the constitution. In relation to this issue, when former senator and then environment minister Graham Richardson was asked in the Senate whether he would use the external affairs power to control land use, he refused to give a guarantee that the government would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let there be no mistake here: the signing of this convention creates a legislative capacity for the government. Historically, this Labor government has used that legislative capacity under the auspices of treaties as a backdoor method of introducing legislation, often overriding state laws in the process. Land management has traditionally been the preserve of the states. The government is abetted in its quest by the courts, which have expansively interpreted the government's intentions in signing treaties and, by such interpretation, have incorporated into Australian common law bodies of international law without the need for legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a deceptive attempt by the federal government to take rural land management control from the states. It is done under the altruistic disguise of providing other countries with the `benefit of our experience and expertise in the development of resource management policies and technology'. That is a quote from Minister for Resources Beddall. Such language is attractive to the public conscience but detracts attention from the real issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience and expertise in relation to land resources, programs to address land degradation and provision of technology to assist ecologically sustainable development can be provided without the need to expose Australia to international law. If aid is required, then why not be honest and call it aid? Australia has a strong record of providing aid in many forms to many countries, without being prompted by an international obligation. Technology exchange can be achieved without being signatory to a convention which has such clouded origins and agendas. A seemingly innocuous treaty, signed under the auspices of the UN, has enormous ramifications for rural, pastoral, tourism and mining communities in this country; and some of those potentially affected communities are not too happy about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an increasing groundswell of interest in and concern about this convention. My call for a Senate inquiry into this matter has been supported at many levels. Both the South Australian Farmers Federation and the New South Wales Farmers Association passed unanimous resolutions at their recent annual conferences to have this matter examined by parliament, notwithstanding that the government is able to sign this treaty currently without examination or public or parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Individuals have written supporting the inquiry on the basis of protecting Australia's sovereignty and hard won freedoms from international laws and vague foreign committees. Ten national associations&mdash;the National Farmers Federation, the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and the Australian Mining Industry Council, to name just a few of them&mdash;jointly signed a paper calling for parliamentary scrutiny of treaties, including this desertification convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people have been denied any avenue for expressing their concerns. A Senate inquiry is necessary to provide an opportunity and a forum for the expression of those concerns, and for the committee to examine the text of this convention in the light of public submissions and Australia's resultant obligations in the context of existing Australian programs for arid-land management. At the very least, interested parties should be given some indication as to how the convention obligations might be implemented. Will the government introduce a national action plan? If so, the National Farmers Federation will oppose ratification of this treaty. The National Farmers Federation has stated that Australia's programs for sustainable agriculture and the use of rangelands:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . must not be put at risk of being re-opened in order to prepare a National Action Program. Not only the Australian delegation, but several delegations were uncomfortable with the concept of a National Action Program to be imposed by central authorities.</PARA>
<PARA>The NFF has also stated that Australia's progress in becoming a world leader in combating desertification has been achieved without the existence or intervention of multilateral processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most pressing reasons for this inquiry is that desertification itself suffers from misconceptions of definition, causes and treatment. Scientific evidence to support theories of desertification is scant and, where it exists, is hotly disputed. Strong arguments have been put forward which indicate that the UN has manipulated dubious scientific evidence and orchestrated a massive publicity campaign to place desertification on the global environmental agenda. The term `bottom up approach', bandied so widely by protagonists of this convention to describe the importance of participation of local groups in land care management, itself commends a local rather than an international approach. Causes of desertification are varied. Origins may be political, social, demographic and climatic. Causes of desertification in one region may be quite different from causes in another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the July-August 1994 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">United Nations Review</EMPHASIS>, the UN perpetuates its own falsely based propaganda, claiming that `the livelihoods of over 900 million people in some 100 countries are threatened by the degradation of fragile lands' and that this `seems to be occurring at an accelerated rate globally'. Following a major review in 1984 by the UN of the action against deserts, Mostafa Tolba, then executive director of UNEP, made claims based on statistics which have since been vehemently disputed by scientists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Figures used by the UN were obtained from a questionnaire sent out by the UNEP in 1982, at the height of drought. Those countries completing the questionnaire also were aware that an exaggeration of the problem would attract more aid dollars to the cause. Hugh Lamprey, commissioned by the UNEP, provided figures on the southward march of the Sahara which were later found to be misleading by the environment arm of the World Bank, because Lamprey `failed to distinguish between temporary effects of drought on the boundaries of the desert and any permanent "desertification"'. Subsequently, the UNEP's terms of reference were expanded to contain the words `mitigate against the effects of drought'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thomas and Middleton note that the general assessments carried out in 1984 `can be noted for their lack of scientific foundation, lack of rigour, lack of consistency and lack of a clear definition or methodological foundation'. They went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNEP was not afraid of using the poorly defined statistics to show just how severe desertification was and to keep the political pot boiling.</PARA>
<PARA>The Institute of Development Studies claimed that definitions of the problem of desertification led to `big public policies being based on very little bits of science'. The International Institute for Environment and Development, a UN-funded agency based in London, claimed that the term `desertification' was `deeply flawed'. Thomas and Middleton also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the field of overseas development aid, many a project has been established and financed in the name of desertification which in fact has relatively little to do with the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>They went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">irrespective of whether claims for desertification's rampant progress can be substantiated, they continue to be made, for without the claims and the awareness that they engender, the work of the institutions and individuals making the claims becomes suspect.</PARA>
<PARA>The director of the Center for Remote Sensing at Boston University and president of the Arab Society for Desert Research, Farouk El-Baz, described the UNEP announcement that `the desert is eating up 62,000 square kilometres of fertile land each year because of human activity', which `means that the Sahara, encompassing about nine million square kilometres of the driest land on Earth, would double in size in 145 years', as `an impossible inference'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He went on to say that the UNEP, the World Bank and the US Agency for International Development, following the Sahel drought of 1968 to 1973, drilled deep wells near towns, resulting in the quadrupling of the population because nomadic people settled near the wells. The nomads and their herds lived in an area that could not support their large numbers and real degradation of the environment began. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pierre Crosson and Norman Rosenberg in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Scientific American</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">UNEP data . . . suggests desertification is a major problem in the world today. Yet all such global estimates must be taken with more than a few grains of salt . . . They depend on the definition of desertification, which may vary . . . accurate estimates of degradative processes are not available . . . Even areas which have been subject to desertification are not necessarily lost to agriculture forever. The overwhelming share of the land reported to the UNEP is rangeland . . . Events in the Sahelian zone of Africa provide a striking example.</PARA>
<PARA>Comparative data in 1980 and 1984 showed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the `Green Wave' appears each year as vegetation is revived by seasonal rains . . . extended drought and overgrazing have made the Sahel a heavily `desertified' region, but even there, the process is reversible.</PARA>
<PARA>Further findings concluded:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In central Africa, satellite photographs taken in 1975 of the shores of Lake Chad which signalled degradation of land revealed that the degradation was the result of the tracks of countless vehicles at a favourite showplace for representatives of international aid agencies&mdash;not, as was originally interpreted, the result of denuded vegetation exposing sand that could drift away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Sahel drought from 1968 to 1973 was followed by six years of rain and then drought again in 1980. As recently as a fortnight ago, floods occurred in previously drought stricken Ethiopia. Scientific evidence indicating the Sudanese desert encroachment to be advancing at a rate of 90 to 100 kilometres annually, as claimed by UNEP, was found to be misleading and, according to Thomas and Middleton, amounted to `little more than hollow political statements used to drum up concern; these are guesstimates or, at best, estimates'. Thomas and Middleton accuse UNEP of `blurring the distinction between desertification and other forms of land degradation outside the dryland realm' in its `enthusiasm to publicise the issue'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UNEP's presentation of data illuminating the magnitude of the problem primarily for political purposes and treating the issue as a global problem is inappropriate given the localised nature of desertification. The UN has been criticised for using desertification to attract funds and actions to `wider political issues affecting relevant developing nations'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `desertification' through the 1980s became associated with vague concepts for dryland development aid. Many development schemes were established in the name of desertification. Project spending on desertification from 1978 to 1983 by four multilateral agencies&mdash;the World Bank, FAO, UNESCO and UNEP&mdash;and the United States Agency for International Development totalled $10,000 million, or an average of $1,667 million a year. However, only 10 per cent of this money was spent on direct field control of desertification. The remainder was channelled into projects described under the wider heading of rural development&mdash;water supplies, feeder roads, establishment of seed multiplication facilities, and control of animal diseases. Some projects, aimed at reducing animal losses and digging more wells, may make desertification, as it is currently understood, actually worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The assessment of how much land turns into desert each year hinges largely on definitions. One definition is that desertification is a `complex process of pulsing deteriorations emanating not from the desert margins but radiating out from centres of excessive population pressure'. The main pressure is not the spread of sand dunes, but the spread of people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">El-Baz claims that misuse of land, use of trees for firewood and overgrazing attributed to local inhabitants as a major cause of desertification has created one of the most prevalent misconceptions of modern times. Desert dwellers, sensitive to their environment long before colonialism, developed strict rules for grazing. He claims that numerous aid projects initiated by genuine concern and subsidised for the purpose of economic development fell into the trap of assuming that outside experts know the desert better than local inhabitants. Ecological colonialism is equated to foreign meddling. Alan Durning and Holly Brough, in an article appearing in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">State of the World 1992</EMPHASIS> stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pastoralists have been accused wrongly of overstocking and destroying range. The Zaghawa of Niger have systems to control rangeland use, they move their animals north to wet season Saharan pastures in separate parallel paths, leaving ungrazed strips for their return treks. Pastoralists are victims, not culprits of environmental degradation. Human population growth is a chief cause.</PARA>
<PARA>In referring to the Sahel, the authors stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most damaging misconception guiding livestock development in Africa was the belief that common ownership of rangeland was inhibiting production and causing degradation.</PARA>
<PARA>Aid agencies recommended dividing the land. This led to accelerated land degradation and exacerbated social inequities. The authors commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Flawed policies and failing institutions channel livestock production in environmentally damaging and inequitable ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many damning articles have appeared in the scientific press over the past few years. Controversy over the issue has raged since the mid-1970s. Causes of desertification attributable to population expansion in Africa are hardly relevant to Australia. Australians need to be assured that basic research is accurate if we are to participate. This may be difficult given the potential for differences of opinion over funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the fifth negotiating session of the convention, the negotiating delegates opposed the request for new and additional resources to be committed. The United States, Japan and the European Union defeated a proposal to commit further funds to finance the implementation of the convention. However, the text does require developed countries to mobilise substantial financial resources and urges developed countries to pursue the possibility of funding anti-desertification action through the global environment facility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim action for Africa, which is the subject of a separate resolution adopted at the final session, requires urgent action for Africa and encourages African and donor countries to strengthen their partnership on anti-desertification action. This new wording provides scope for developed countries like Australia to determine the way in which they choose to respond and whether to submit a national action plan or not. This means that, with the exception of the African and north Mediterranean countries, for which the term `as appropriate' has been omitted from their annex, there is no firm obligation, even on affected developing countries, to prepare national action plans. One is left to wonder how implementation will occur and how the allocated funding will be spent. The National Farmers Federation representative accompanying the Australian delegation stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Convention negotiations placed more emphasis on North/South aid issues, especially to Africa, than environmental protection. Scientific issues, including theories about a "desertification" phenomenon and the relative importance of natural and human factors behind dryland degradation, generally took a back seat.</PARA>
<PARA>Thomas and Middleton state that the lion's share of the money raised&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . goes to the employment of consultants and experts, their fees and field work expenses. Too little reaches local communities, and all too often development programme failures have been put down to a lack of community participation.</PARA>
<PARA>One begins to see the desertification umbrella under which a range of other social and political issues are sheltered. One also discovers that there is credence to the criticisms levelled by Thomas, Middleton and others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia does have a long way to go in terms of solving our own problems with drought and arid land management before we become a benefactor to the rest of the world. International preoccupation with long-term global problems comes at the expense of more mundane but urgent ecological crises. Certainly, the Australian government should reconsider its involvement in this convention. Historically, Australian parliaments have not scrutinised international treaties prior to signing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exhaustive negotiations for a desertification convention were concluded on 17 June this year. Australia did play a very positive role and a very active role throughout those negotiations. I think it is important to point out to the Senate that Australia's delegation to these negotiation sessions included not only representatives of state governments&mdash;Senator Chapman emphasised that issue&mdash;but also representatives from the National Farmers Federation. Senator Chapman was keen to point out that he had two supporters from the NFF in New South Wales and South Australia. I think it is very instructive to realise that the NFF was involved in the Australian delegation, as was the Australian Conservation Foundation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The negotiating committee recognised the need for greater coordination and efficiency of existing multilateral and bilateral programs to combat desertification and agreed to the establishment of a global mechanism which, as part of its general facilitating role, will work to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of existing financial mechanisms. The government does not see a need to revisit these issues, which have already been more than adequately canvassed, and will not be supporting this reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We also will not be supporting Senator Chapman's motion, but for somewhat different reasons from the ones indicated by the government, although the government did not give a great deal of information as to why it was not supporting the motion. We have a great deal of sympathy for a lot of what Senator Chapman has said and we believe that there are some very important issues involved. The reasons we do not support this motion are that there is a confusion in the way Senator Chapman has presented this issue and that it is better dealt with in other ways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is dealing with three quite separate issues, and it is important to tease those issues out. Firstly, there is the matter of the signing of international or intranational agreements which bypass the political process, something to which I have referred repeatedly in this chamber. International conventions signed by the government often lead to legislation presented to this parliament. When that happens, we are frequently told that it is totally impossible for us to amend, even in the most trivial ways, any part of that legislation. We are told that this has been negotiated, it is an international convention and the legislation in Australia must give effect absolutely precisely to this convention&mdash;no more, no less. That is bypassing the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see exactly the same thing in this issue. The opposition is totally inconsistent with intergovernmental agreements. It is very keen on intergovernmental agreements within Australia and has watered down many of the environmental protection measures in Australia in the name of so-called states rights. But exactly the same thing happens, and the opposition should be just as concerned about that aspect&mdash;namely, that the various states of Australia and the Commonwealth enter into an agreement which is done outside the parliamentary process, it comes to this parliament in the form of legislation, and this parliament is again told that it cannot change one T, or one full stop, or one comma lest the complementary legislation passed in the other states does not exactly parallel the legislation passed here. Again, it bypasses the political process. That is one issue. It is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be bringing forward in this parliament in a different form a consideration of that very matter&mdash;that international agreements should indeed be dealt with by some process which involves at least a parliamentary scrutiny of what the government intends to enter into. That issue is a broad issue. It goes well beyond a particular treaty, a desertification treaty or convention, or any other treaty. It is a general question that should be dealt with as a general matter and should be solved once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue Senator Chapman took up is the reliability of the evidence in relation to desertification. Interestingly, he has quoted a couple of scientists from England. I did not think England was subject to a great deal of desertification. Nonetheless, he has confused that very point with the reference to a rural and regional committee and drawn attention to the fact that many people in Australia are concerned about the impact on Australian farmers of the signing of this convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely if there is argument about the scientific basis of desertification, if there is argument about whether desertification is indeed a process at all, or exactly what the definition of desertification is or should be, then it is more appropriate to send this not to a committee like that&mdash;and I understand that Senator Chapman wished to send it to a select committee&mdash;but to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which is the appropriate committee to look at that very aspect on which he has laid so much emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this point I draw attention to the fact that we are very shortly to change the committee structure of the Senate to set up new committees. Part of the reason for that, which has been agreed to by all the parties in the Senate, was to deal with these references by standing committees as far as possible and not to have select committees. We are all involved in a number of these committees and the workload is getting intense. That is the second point which needs to be made. If there is substance to Senator Chapman's claim in relation to whether or not desertification is a factor, then that issue should go to a different committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that needs to be made is in relation to the actual terms of reference included in Senator Chapman's motion. Here he has moved right away from his concern over definitions, over the processes of desertification. He said that population growth is the chief cause&mdash;I think I am quoting him correctly&mdash;of desertification in many of these processes. Do we find any reference to that in his terms of reference? We do not find any. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While he has expressed concern about the definition of desertification, wanting to satisfy himself on that, he seems to be dealing with this very much as a political issue in referring it to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. Again, the terms of reference are oriented more towards appeasing a group of people who, by his own admission, are substantially concerned about an issue which is unlikely to arise, that is, the application of this convention back into Australia. Even if it were to arise, if the issue of what is desertification and those processes were better sorted out, then that would be the better way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not supporting Senator Chapman's motion. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that I also have a motion before the Senate. It has somewhat different terms of reference, which is to put that reference to the standing committee on the environment. That motion will come back in the next sitting week. That is to allow somewhat more time for groups to have an input to that process. We believe that is a more appropriate way to proceed than by way of the motion that Senator Chapman has put before us this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues are important. As I said, the general question of international conventions and treaties bypassing the political process is a very important general question. It should not be dealt with in the context of a particular and narrow reference but should be dealt with far more broadly. Secondly, the issue of desertification and that particular treaty is better dealt with in this other way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the motion by Senator Chapman to refer the UN convention on desertification to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs is an important motion, and a motion which deserves the support of this chamber. This convention has the potential for enormous ramifications for people who live outside the coastal area of this country. It is estimated that the area which could be affected under this treaty, if the provisions of the treaty are imported into this country, is up to 76 per cent of the Australian continent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the opposition are very concerned that one of the implications of this treaty will be a loss of control for farmers over their farms, for local communities and local authorities over their shires, and for the states over their constitutional responsibility for land management issues. For that reason, we believe it is important that this matter be referred to the committee, as Senator Chapman has suggested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, on the other hand, has said, `No, we don't believe it should be submitted to a committee because "the convention was subject to extensive negotiations".' So what if the convention was subject to extensive negotiations between an Australian negotiating party and a Sudanese negotiating party and a French negotiating party and whoever else happened to be there when they were drawing up the convention? That does not mean that this parliament should have no say in whether this treaty is signed or not, and it does not mean that this parliament does not have a right to scrutinise this treaty. That is the most flimsy excuse that I have heard in a long time for not having parliamentary scrutiny of what the executive does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might be interested to know the process by which it is approved whether a treaty is signed or not. This was a matter that Senator Kemp and I put to Senator Gareth Evans when he appeared before Estimates Committee A on 24 May this year. For the benefit of honourable senators, I might read out exactly what Senator Evans said in relation to the ratification of a treaty. As honourable senators will know, a treaty is first signed and then it is ratified. Senator Gareth Evans advised the estimates committee that the signing of a treaty was a matter for the minister alone. When we asked him about ratification, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a matter of relevant ministerial approval followed by executive council determination. It invariably involves the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and such other subject ministers as are associated with that particular issue. That is the normal way. On occasions there may be a formal Cabinet decision, but far more often than not it is dealt with at the ministerial level, but with a formal ratification being a matter for executive council approval.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this government has a totally arrogant attitude when it comes to international conventions. This government has usurped for a small number of people the right to decide whether or not this country signs treaties and ratifies them and on what terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe that that is wholly unfair and wholly inappropriate. It is the right of the Australian people to have an input to matters which will affect them. This convention has enormous possibility to affect the rights of ordinary Australians, particularly ordinary Australians who live outside the coastal areas. That is why Senator Chapman's motion is so important today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans made it very clear when he appeared before the estimates committee that these matters do not even necessarily go before the cabinet. A couple of ministers sit together around a cup of cappuccino at Aussie's and decide that they are going to sign a treaty: hey presto, next thing we know, the government is asserting in the High Court of this country that the states have no right to manage their own land areas, that local authorities have no right to manage their shires, and that farmers have no right to manage their farms.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government does not believe in parliamentary scrutiny; it does not believe in the right of the parliament to have a say on these issues. While the galleries are full of school students who are here to see how parliament works, it is interesting for them to note that this government is opposing parliamentary scrutiny of a convention which could have enormous ramifications for this country and for the people who live in it. So much for this government's belief in democracy, and so much for this government's belief in parliamentary accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have before us is the total and absolute refusal of this government to brook any scrutiny on this treaty at all. One of the reasons why this government does not want scrutiny of this treaty is that `Australia had a leading role in the negotiations'. Well, so what, if a group of public servants and a minister had a leading role in negotiating a treaty?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not for bureaucrats and ministers alone to decide what Australia's obligations shall be. It is not for bureaucrats and ministers alone to rewrite the constitution by signing treaties willy-nilly. It is the responsibility of Australia's parliamentary representatives to ensure that the rights of ordinary Australian citizens are protected. In this government's refusal to accept Senator Chapman's reference of this matter to a committee, it is showing that it has utter contempt for the rights of ordinary Australian citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman has quite rightly said that this treaty could have very, very deleterious effects on farmers and people who live in isolated areas of this country.

I do not believe that as responsible legislators we should give this government, or any government, a blank cheque in relation to these matters. These matters should come before the parliament for scrutiny, and that is what Senator Chapman has sought to do. And that is why I believe that Senator Chapman's motion is correct and ought to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us consider this matter of the national action plan. The NFF has said that it supports the treaty on the basis that there is no national action plan. Unfortunately, what was not explained to the NFF, and what was not explained by the government to anybody else who inquired, was that once the treaty was signed there was no mechanism by which any of the plans that the government may wish to lodge as national action plans under the terms of the treaty could be scrutinised by the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, this government would assert that once those national action plans are lodged they are binding on the federal government. The government would assert that they are binding on state governments. It would assert that they are binding on local authorities. It would assert that they are binding on farmers. A bureaucrat in Canberra has no understanding of what it takes to run a property, no understanding of what it takes to make a go of living on the land, and no understanding of the very, very delicate balance that exists and has continued to exist through good management.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government would leave it all to people who are unaccountable to parliament to draw up plans to be lodged under this treaty which would become binding. We do not believe that that is appropriate. The government would also have us believe that once that treaty is signed there is nothing that can be done to limit the scope of Australia's obligations under the treaty. That is absolute balderdash. It is, of course, open to this country to lodge a reservation to the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important matter. What, honourable senators might ask, is a reservation to a treaty? A reservation to a treaty is defined in the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties 1969 as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . a unilateral statement, however phrased or named, made by a state when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty whereby it purports to exclude or modify the legal effect of certain provisions of the treaty in their application to that state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, it is open to this parliament to say, `We will sign the treaty and we will agree to meet whatever obligations or assistance flows from it, but we reserve for our parliament the right to decide matters that affect this country. More importantly, we reserve for the states, for local communities and for the people most affected, the right to decide how land under their control should be managed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be entirely consistent with article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties for Australia, through the parliamentary processes, to formulate a reservation in relation to this treaty. There are only three restrictions on our lodging a reservation to this convention. Firstly, we cannot lodge a reservation if the reservation is of a nature expressly prohibited in the treaty&mdash;that is not the case in this particular matter. Secondly, we cannot lodge a reservation if the reservation falls outside the provisions of a treaty permitting only certain kinds of reservations&mdash;that does not apply here either. Thirdly, we could not lodge reservations which are incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty&mdash;I doubt that would be the case either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely open to this parliament&mdash;it is entirely open to the government to invite this parliament&mdash;to formulate a reservation that would protect the Australian people from this government at a subsequent date, or from a subsequent government, lodging national action plans which had not been approved by this parliament and by each of the states. That would be a reservation entirely consistent not only with the Australian constitution but also with the intent of the UN convention itself. But is the government interested in doing that? The answer is no&mdash;and why? Because this government does not want the parliament or the states or the people having any say in what sort of obligations this government accepts on behalf of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: would it be unfair for the parliament to have the right to say, `We believe any national action plan which you lodge should be submitted for approval by the states and by the parliament'? That is the question that needs to be asked here. Very clearly, the answer is that it would not be unfair. In fact, it would be unfair if that opportunity were not given to the parliament and to the states. That is the question at issue here and the question that the government has tried to avoid. It has tried to avoid the fact that by signing this treaty it is being grossly unfair to the people who are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the chamber we believe that the matter of reservations should be explored by the appropriate committee and that the appropriate committee is the rural and regional affairs committee. Why is the rural and regional affairs committee the appropriate committee to consider these matters? It is because rural and regional Australians are the ones who will be affected if the provisions of this treaty are imported into this country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter for the science committee to decide whether it believes desertification exists. It is not a principle issue, whether it is appropriate that this scientist or that scientist should be believed. It is sufficient for Senator Chapman to say, `Look, there are doubts about the validity of desertification and, given those doubts, it is appropriate that the matter be sent to a committee that will examine the impact on the people who will suffer.' That is why Senator Chapman's reference is so absolutely critical and so absolutely correct. </PARA>

Those of us who live in rural and regional Australia know that a couple of months ago the Democrats came up with a grandiose plan called `Democrats for the bush'. Where is Senator Coulter's support for the bush when he does not want the matter to go before the rural and regional affairs committee?

They have no regard for the impact this convention could have on people in western Queensland, in South Australia, in western New South Wales, in Western Australia or the Northern Territory.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a great shame, an enormous shame, if this Senate did not seize this opportunity to send this treaty for examination by the rural and regional affairs committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the chamber we are saying that this issue is a test case for referring a treaty to a committee, getting clear evidence on the impact the treaty will have on the people most affected and formulating appropriate guidelines and reservations, if necessary, to apply to the treaty if it is ratified. If the government and the Democrats are not willing to cooperate with the reference Senator Chapman has proposed, we do not believe that it is right or proper for the government to have open slather to deal with this matter as it wishes.

The precautionary principle says, `You do not wait until it is so darn obvious that everybody can see what the implications are because if you do wait, it is probably too late.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the beaten up fears of the opposition, we have a number of national policies which have been signed and agreed to by all parties&mdash;including all states&mdash;but we do not necessarily see those being kept to. We have forest protection strategies. We have signed the international climatic change convention. At the moment, the Australian government has not done the very little that it is obligated to do under that convention. The reality is that the desertification convention is another great example of Australian negotiators going into the international arena and telling other countries what to do. The only possible implications are that Australia would do things or transfer technology to other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having just come back from southern Africa, I can say that there does not seem to be a current desire for Australia to assist southern Africa or Saharan Africa in any way. In fact, the Minister for Development Cooperation and Pacific Island Affairs (Mr Bilney) has recently stated that Australia is not keen on increasing its aid to Africa. I wonder whether or not the two parties&mdash;the people involved in signing the treaty, and the people involved in aid in the Australian government&mdash;have actually talked to each other and worked out whether they are both going in the same direction. I would like to see some real moves to look at the needs of southern Africa and sub-Saharan Africa, but I have not seen any great evidence of that at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens did consider supporting this motion, but only if it included a balanced viewpoint which looked at the implications of desertification. In our view, if we are going to look at the implications of signing the treaty, we also need to look at the implications of desertification. If we are going to get an analysis of the impacts on the Australian environment, economy and social system, we need to have a balanced view. The opposition refused that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked for the extent of desertification of Australia's rangelands and its causes; the environmental, social and economic impacts; actions required to halt and reverse desertification in Australia and overseas; the capacity of the convention to contribute to Australia's efforts in those actions; and the means of monitoring the progress of programs directed at reversing desertification in Australia. The opposition has not included that in its motion. It has refused to accept that as part of the motion. So there was no way that we could support this motion when it was designed simply as a means of point scoring in relation to the convention and the treaty. We need to look at these considerations if there is to be any real examination of the way the environment is directly related to our future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to realise that, unlike the Democrats, the Greens were prepared to accept a reference of this matter to a select committee. I am quite curious about the pressure that has been put on us recently because a number of people have said that agreement has been reached between the major parties that select committees will no longer be set up. I do not know whether such an agreement exists. I would certainly like to see exactly what has been agreed upon by the other parties because no such agreement has been reached by the Greens. If such an agreement exists, I would certainly like to see the details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, there might be a lesser need for select committees if the new committee system works as expected. At the moment, the Senate has the ability to refer to select committees for inquiry matters which do not fit into the present structure or matters which cannot be dealt with by the appropriate committee because of the workload of that committee. It would be very easy and convenient for a government to fill up a committee with references so that it could not take on any more and then say, `We don't have the ability to have select committees, therefore, we cannot have this inquiry.' It would be a very sad thing for the democratic process in this place if there was an agreement by the major parties to remove the Senate's ability to establish a select committee when required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Chapman that it is very convenient to find tame scientists who are prepared to stand up against the majority. I am not talking about a lunatic fringe; I am talking about the majority of people in society who are concerned about the future and ecological sustainability. One has only to look at well-funded institutions like the Tasman Institute, which is funded by the mining and oil industries to present papers to the community to try to argue against the existence of such things as the greenhouse effect, to realise just how threatened very large corporations are by this growing awareness of the need for ecological sustainability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always possible to find the oddball out, the person who is prepared to stand up on behalf of corporations and argue that these things are mythical. Pointing to the oddball out simply indicates what the real wealth of information is saying. One would have to be blind not to see the changes that are being made to our society and our environment. Farmers and others who make their livelihood from the land are well aware of any changes to climate and to their land. Quite often they need more help than the government gives. However, they will be the ones who will feel it most. </PARA>

If we destroy the environment we will not have an economy. It is about time some of these connections were recognised by those people who are standing up and saying, `Yes, the government should do something for farmers. We cannot do anything about desertification because it will be the end of the world.' Such people forget that changes to the climate and to our environment will destroy farmers a lot more quickly than the absence of any positive moves to try to address their problems. </PARA>

Of course, while desertification is not the focus of landcare, it is part of any consideration of this reference. Landcare funding, which was introduced some time ago by the government, has the support of the National Farmers Federation, the conservationists and the Greens. There is very little difference of opinion as to how we should look after the land or, in cases where the land has been degraded, how we should bring the land back. There is no doubt that, if one wants to look after the land, desertification becomes an issue, and we should support any proposal which prevents any further desertification in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to respond to the arguments that have been put by Senator Faulkner and Senator Burns on behalf of the government, by Senator Coulter on behalf of the Australian Democrats and by Senator Margetts on behalf of the Greens (WA). Can</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>I say at the outset that I am extremely disappointed at the refusal of any of those political groups to support the reference of this very important issue to a committee for inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner defended the government's position in not supporting the reference of the government's intention to sign the desertification convention to a Senate committee for investigation on the basis that there were a wide range of representatives on Australia's delegation to the final negotiating session on this treaty and that the negotiating committees from the various countries represented at that session agree that there is a need for a global mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say in response that, in the first instance, he referred to the fact that state governments and the National Farmers Federation had representatives in Australia's delegation. Notwithstanding the fact that at this stage the NFF, in the way in which the Australian delegation has agreed to the convention, supports it, the NFF also supports the fact that before this convention is signed there ought to be a parliamentary inquiry into it. The fact that it was part of the Australian delegation does not in any way diminish the fact that this Senate committee should inquire into Australia's signing of this convention, because at least one of the groups that was represented on Australia's delegation supports this committee reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, as I said in my earlier remarks, two of its state constituent bodies, the South Australian Farmers Federation and the New South Wales Farmers Federation, passed unanimous resolutions&mdash;not just a majority&mdash;at their recent state conferences, saying that Australia should not sign this convention before it had been investigated by an appropriate parliamentary committee. So let us have none of the nonsense that the fact that one of the members of the Australian delegation in the final analysis went along with our agreement last June to this convention in any way precludes a parliamentary inquiry into this convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in relation to Senator Faulkner's point on the conclusion of the negotiating committee regarding the need for a global mechanism on this issue, of course that committee would agree. It is part of the international bureaucracy which feeds off this system of international conventions and international agreements. Again, the fact that a group of international professional bureaucrats agreed to this convention is no argument against this parliament investigating the impact on Australia of the signing of this convention. Senator Faulkner's arguments simply do not stand the test of scrutiny. Senator Coulter said that he had a lot of sympathy for what I said in my remarks in proposing this reference. But, having said that, he still would not support the reference. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, in a general sense. He then went on to say that there were three points that I had made in support of the reference: firstly, the signing of this convention, as with other conventions, involves signing an international agreement which bypasses our domestic political process with the consequence that legislation flows from that signing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a minute, Senator Coulter, in relation to the comments made by Senator Margetts. Secondly, he agreed that there were questions about the reliability of the evidence with regard to the issue of desertification and, therefore, it was valid to question the impact of this convention on farmers. Thirdly, he supported my contention that one of the important issues in relation to desertification was the issue of population growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, he then said that, because all of those three elements were involved in this issue, it should not go to the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for investigation; it should go up to the environment committee. Yet he has just identified at least two of the three areas that really do not relate to environmental matters at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Coulter well knows, as a compromise I offered to the Democrats and the Greens the option of a select committee to investigate this matter, and they refused that&mdash;certainly the Democrats refused that. They insisted on the matter going not to the rural and regional affairs committee, not to a select committee, but to the environment committee. There is some inconsistency in what Senator Coulter says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, the matter of international treaties and the domestic policy impact of international treaties is not a matter for the environment committee. In the context of this convention, it certainly is in some respects a matter for the rural and regional affairs committee, because the primary impact on domestic policy of this particular convention will be on people in rural and regional areas. So it is appropriate that it go to that committee; but if not to that committee, then to a select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, with regard to the reliability of evidence, there may be some relevance of that to an environment committee. But, again, given that this issue ranges over more than just the environment and primarily relates to its impact on rural and regional people, then either the rural and regional affairs committee or a select committee would be the appropriate avenue for investigation. His rather poor defence, in terms of not supporting the reference to a select committee, was, as Senator Margetts indicated, that he believes that the new committee structure that is about to come into place precludes the role of select committees&mdash;that we are in fact restructuring our system of standing committees to avoid the need for select committees. </PARA>

My intention was to have this inquiry completed by then, because it is the intention of the government to sign this treaty on about 15 October. So any inquiry that we have in relation to this treaty needs to be initiated and completed by that date, a date before the new committee structure comes into place. To say that the new committee structure precludes a reference to a select committee is absolute nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now deal with his argument that it should go to the environment committee because this is a matter, as I said, that has some relevance to population growth. Certainly, the issue in terms of its impact in Africa, as I explained in my introductory remarks, has some relevance to population growth, but certainly not in relation to Australia is this a matter to which population growth has any relevance whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue at stake in this convention is not a significant problem in Australia in regard to population growth. In the areas of Australia to which the matter is relevant, it is most definitely not an issue in relation to population growth, because they are the most sparsely populated areas of Australia and are actually having a decline in their population. So to say that, in terms of the relevance of this issue to Australia, it is a matter of population growth, and again argue that it ought to go to the environment committee, is complete and absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also said that he would not support the reference because this convention was not likely to apply to Australia. Who knows what the government will do in the future in pursuit of centralisation of power?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On numerous occasions this Labor government over the last decade has abused the external affairs power under the constitution by, as I say, taking unto itself powers which rightly belong under state jurisdiction. The government has done that in many instances well after the signing of the particular convention or treaty that it has then used or abused, or under which it has abused the external affairs power to take that jurisdiction unto itself. So who knows, Senator Coulter, what this government, a Labor government, will do down the track under the external affairs power as a result of signing this convention to take power unto itself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This convention has an almost fraudulent basis, given the enormous disagreement and dispute amongst scientists as to the basis of desertification and the evidence in relation to it. Everything that we need to do in this country to deal with this problem can already be done, both internationally and domestically. We do not need this convention. Australia does not need to sign this convention to do what it needs to do in this country to deal with this problem in regard to rangelands, to the extent that it exists, nor do we need this convention to do anything we might want to do internationally to assist other countries to deal with this problem. We can quite easily do that under existing bilateral and multilateral aid provisions. So why do we need this treaty? That is the question that needs to be asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's refusal to support an investigation into the convention by a Senate committee can only lead to the conclusion that it has something to hide. We need to ask: what is the government's hidden agenda? What will it do in the future? How will it in the future use this convention to determine domestic policy by abusing the external affairs power? We need the answers to those questions, and that is a very important reason why this matter ought to be referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the arguments that Senator Margetts from the Western Australian Greens used in indicating their opposition to this reference to a committee. She raised the issue of the GATT agreement, and Senator Coulter raised it a few moments ago by way of interjection. Senator Margetts said that this government had gone off and signed the GATT agreement and that we in the opposition did not insist that that be investigated by a Senate committee, and therefore she accused us of inconsistency or hypocrisy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Margetts does not understand is that the GATT agreement does not in any way extend the legislative power of the Commonwealth government or the Commonwealth parliament. The Commonwealth parliament already has the powers relating to trade under the constitution as it exists. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but under power which it already has. The GATT agreement is not extending the legislative power of the Commonwealth. Excise tariff bills and customs tariff bills regularly come into this chamber for debate and discussion, which bills relate to trade issues. There is no extension of the Commonwealth's legislative power as a result of its signing the GATT agreement, but there is potentially in its signing of this particular convention through the extension it gives via the external affairs power. So again Senator Margetts has shown her lack of knowledge of the constitution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern that we and so many people in the community have about the signing of conventions and treaties relates to those which can potentially change the balance of power between the Commonwealth and the states by giving the Commonwealth the chance to use the external affairs power to determine domestic policy&mdash;not foreign policy but domestic policy&mdash;as was never envisaged under the constitution. That is the central issue with regard to the government's signing of conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts also expressed the view that the government does not really seem very interested in helping Africa. She referred to statements by Minister Bilney. She referred to her own recent experience in visiting there. If that is the case&mdash;and it would seem from Minister Bilney's statements that it is the case&mdash;we again need to ask the question: why is the government signing this convention? It raises yet again the concern that the government has quite another motive for signing this convention, that is, the centralisation of power to itself and the removal of powers which quite correctly should remain under state government jurisdiction. Of course, what that means is giving the Commonwealth the capacity to remove the control of land management from the states, from local government and from individual farmers and graziers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts also referred to the additional terms of reference&mdash;I think the terms of reference were originally drafted by the Democrats, but the Greens seem to have picked them up&mdash;which she had discussed with me and sought our support for. There is a very obvious and clear reason why we would not support those additional terms of reference: those terms of reference involved a major inquiry, a very lengthy inquiry, into the whole issue of desertification. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central thrust of what we are trying to achieve in this committee reference is to investigate the impact on Australia, and particularly on domestic policy, of Australia's signing of the convention on desertification. That would, as I have said, be a relatively short-term inquiry. Indeed, it needs to be a short-term inquiry because it needs to be completed before 15 October, which is when the government intends to sign this treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no way that the additional terms of reference which had been sought by the Democrats and the Greens could have been completed within that time frame. As I said, the terms of reference which they wanted involved a major inquiry, a quite separate inquiry. If they want to pursue that issue, they can do it by putting up those terms of reference, as indeed I think Senator Coulter has, for a separate inquiry. But they should in no way be confused with the issues at stake in this particular reference and should not be used as a reason for refusing to support this reference, because it is, as I said, a quite separate issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts also claimed that, in relation to the scientific evidence on desertification and its contributing factors and nature, it is very easy to find tame scientists who will put a point of view on behalf of companies or whatever. Apart from the fact that that is an ad hominem argument, it is of course not true in relation to this particular issue. As Senator Coulter himself acknowledged, there is a lot of disagreement about the nature and causes of desertification. What Senator Margetts refuses to do is look at the evidence and the arguments which have been presented by these scientists and which I presented in my remarks earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Margetts that Drs Thomas and Middleton, to whom I referred extensively in my speech when moving this motion, are not oddball, as she asserted. On the contrary, they are at the centre of scientific research on desertification and indeed were the major contributors to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Atlas of Desertification</EMPHASIS>, which was published by the United Nations Environment Program itself. So to try to negate the arguments of these two reputable scientists in the scandalous way in which Senator Margetts has done by referring to them as oddball, when, as I said, they are central and well-recognised researchers on this issue and are in fact the authors of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Atlas of Desertification</EMPHASIS>, simply shows how far from reality her argument is and shows the lack of knowledge and consideration of this issue by the Western Australian Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I turn to the remarks made on behalf of the government by Senator Burns, who, I suppose, raised two issues in relation to this matter. Firstly, he said that a number of issues were currently under investigation in the landcare inquiry currently being undertaken by the rural and regional affairs committee. I agree with him on that. In fact, that again reinforces why there was no need for the extended terms of reference sought by the Democrats and the Greens on this issue. A lot of those issues&mdash;the actual nature of desertification itself in relation to Australia and the issues surrounding that&mdash;are already under investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the reference that I have moved this morning is to investigate the convention's constitutional and domestic policy impact on Australia and its effect on farmers and graziers in particular. The issue of desertification and the environment issues themselves, as I said, are matters for another inquiry and, as Senator Burns has indicated, they form part of an inquiry that is already being undertaken. So Senator Burns, in effect, reinforced the arguments that I have put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns then referred to stocking rates. He said there ought to be control over what farmers and graziers do in relation to their land management; they should not be allowed to overstock; there should be some control over stocking rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Burns&mdash;I agree with him 100 per cent. But there already is that control&mdash;at the state level, where appropriately it should lie. State governments already, in terms of their lease agreements with pastoralists, define stocking rates and define land management principles that have to be observed, otherwise those leases are not renewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying is that that is the level where the control ought to remain because that is where it is appropriate: closest to the people who are affected and where decisions are made by people closest to the issue. It should not be usurped by a central government here in Canberra by abusing the external affairs power, which the government will be able to do if it signs and ratifies this convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That should not be allowed to be done at all. Leave it where it appropriately lies, under state government jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, that is the whole central issue in regard to this convention: what is the government's intention? Senator Burns has let the cat out of the bag by raising that very issue. Quite obviously, it is the intention of a centralising Labor government to take this control of land management unto itself and away from its appropriate jurisdiction, the state level. Senator Burns has let the cat out of the bag by referring to that very issue. Again, that simply reinforces the need for this inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I continue my remarks from yesterday when the basic thrust of my comments was that this bill, although named the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill, is further eroding the basis on which the states could use funds being supplied under this piece of legislation. What is so devastating about this bill is that its title belies the fact. The title, in effect, says that this bill is designed to give money to the states for their purposes and priorities, designated by the various state governments as they deem fit. Yet there are provisions in this bill which further erode the right of states to determine their own social policies and their own agendas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 10 and 11, to a certain extent, are an interesting development. I will be seeking to ask some questions about those clauses during the committee stage. It would appear that moneys previously paid as a specific grant under the Australian Land Transport Development Act 1988 are being replaced by a provision in this legislative vehicle. Whilst clause 11 purports to state that states are not bound to use this money for roads, the political pressure will clearly be there. The outcome will, of course, be very interesting to observe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the other aspect of this bill which is not so subtle is the treatment of tertiary education by this centralist government, which seems to have a guiding philosophy of `Canberra knows best'. Clause 14 makes the payment of financial assistance dependent on the states making a payment to the Commonwealth for their share of unfunded superannuation liabilities in relation to tertiary institutions within the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 15 of this bill is simply the most outrageous and, of course, objectionable part of this legislation. It is an affront to generally accepted principles of what is right and wrong. It denies people the choice of joining or not joining a student union. At the moment, if students do not join a student union they are denied their results or the right to re-enrolment. It is an admission that if students are given a choice they will refuse to join the union. What a terrible indictment on the leadership, policies and alleged services provided by the student unions around this country!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, this clause is seeking to deny the states the right to implement policies which they deem appropriate. There will always be a divergence of opinion as to whether student unions ought be compulsory or voluntary. I accept that. Those who argue for compulsion, I believe, are grossly wrong, but the real issue is: who should determine whether or not student unions are voluntary or compulsory? If a state government has a policy for voluntary student unionism, then that state ought be allowed to have such legislation without the fear of financial penalties being imposed. Of course, that is what this legislation does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth is clearly abusing its tax and financing powers in order to impose its political will on the states. It seeks to enforce compulsory student unionism. It seeks to deny students the opportunity to make a considered decision as to whether or not they will join a student union. This clause unblushingly imposes a financial penalty on any state giving students the opportunity to choose as to membership of student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a student union to enforce its compulsory nature, it needs to apply a sanction or impose a penalty for the non-joiners. Historically and shamefully, university administrations behaving like shop stewards have applied the sanction or penalty by withholding results or the opportunity to re-enrol for the following year. In other words, `no ticket, no education' is the Labor Party motto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same Labor Party which so gratuitously lectured the states in Darwin recently on implementing the Hilmer report, getting rid of monopolies, introducing competition and getting rid of red tape is the same party that in an important piece of legislation such as this walks right away from any removal of monopoly power and removal of freedom of choice and competition by maintaining compulsory student unionism. Basically, Labor is saying to the people of Australia&mdash;it would be interesting to hear what the Democrats and Greens say on this&mdash;that compulsory student unionism is more important than an education. It is saying, `If you do not join the union, you will not get an education.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, in my home state of Tasmania we had the shameful case of Daniel Muggeridge. He was a student&mdash;indeed, a prize winning student&mdash;who joined the student union in his first year. In his second year he decided not to join the union. He received the appropriate notification from the university saying that he was banned from using the library and would have his results withheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a student who last year was placed on the dean's honour role of excellence. He won the Digby Fitzhardinge Memorial Prize. He achieved four high distinctions and two distinctions in the first year of his science degree. Despite such an excellent academic record, this man was to be denied a future career for the benefit of Australia because the Labor Party and the university administration put compulsory student unionism before Daniel Muggeridge's right to join or not join a student union. The Labor Party says, `That is okay. That is fine.' I find that to be reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I do not rely on international treaties to determine my social policy, the ALP clearly does, as witnessed by its treatment of Tasmania. So let us look at article 20 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1)Everyone has the right to freedom of peaceful assembly and association.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2)No-one shall be compelled to belong to an association. </PARA>
<PARA>What is it other than compulsion to say to a young man or woman in Australia, `If you want to have a tertiary education, you can only do so if you join the student union?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where is the Labor Party on this? Its motivation clearly is not the implementation of an international treaty on this occasion. Its motivation is to ensure that it continues to get the financial benefit of the funds that are laundered through the student unions to the Labor Party. It is very interesting to see how this legislation will work itself out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more outrageous, the more out of touch, the more extreme, the more undemocratic a student union is, the more the average Australian student will be turned away from that student union. In response, the Labor government says, `We will accordingly reward you'&mdash;that is the student union&mdash;`with all the lost income being returned to you out of taxpayers' funds.' On the other hand, a responsible student union with fair and proper elections with sensible policies which would achieve 100 per cent membership of students at the tertiary institution would not get a single red cent from this Labor government. So in other words, the Labor Party policy is: `We will reward the most extreme, the most outrageous student union and make up the funds that the student union loses because students do not want to join, yet those student organisations that have the capacity of attracting all students on the campus into their membership will not get funding.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question has to be asked: what is the motivation of the Labor government in pursuing this course of action? It is not to ensure responsible student unions. It is not to ensure fairness or equity. None of those issues apply. The test is:  `We need money for our party political campaigns. In the past we have had money laundered through the student unions for our benefit and we need that to continue, so we will continue with this outrageous approach.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are legions of examples of the Australian Labor Party benefiting from compulsory student unionism. First of all, it creates the psyche in a lot of people at the very commencement of their careers that compulsion is okay. Also, in political terms the National Union of Students was of great assistance&mdash;financial, training, providing propaganda, providing personnel&mdash;during the last federal election campaign. I will be pursuing that aspect further during the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is another convenient example for the opposition to expose Labor's priorities&mdash;that it would put compulsory student unionism before the rights of state governments to determine their priorities and funding. We all know that the funding of hospitals, schools and police&mdash;those important areas that states fund&mdash;are the province of the states. If the federal government goes ahead with its policy of taking money from the states, it is saying that it is more important to fund a compulsory student union than to ensure that states have sufficient funds in relation to policing, health and education. That is once again a reflection on this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government, which had the audacity to lecture the states in Darwin about competition and about the Hilmer report, saying, `We've got to get rid of monopolies,' is the same government that will keep its monopoly on trade union power. We all know that if we want to talk about real micro-economic reform the labour markets need to be addressed, but the government will not address that because it involves its mates and that is the basic source of funding for the Australian Labor Party. So it will not interfere in that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a Commonwealth government to say to a state government, `It is more important that a student union be funded than police, health or education,' is an indictment of the politically perverse agenda that the Labor Party has established and is pursuing. It is an abuse of our federal system of government. It is an abuse of our constitution. Indeed, it is an abrogation by the Labor government of a fundamental human right which has been expressed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&mdash;a declaration that it believes ought to be imported everywhere into domestic law. It is the right of all students in this country to join or not to join a student union. To deny them the right of choice is in effect to deny some the right to an education. I will always put the right to education before some supposed need to compel students, like sheep, into the flock of a compulsory student union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill clearly shows that the Labor Party has no commitment to the states. It has no commitment to allowing the states to set their own agendas and be elected on policies which clearly the people of their states want them to implement for the good government of their states. The Labor Party will always say, `If we can wangle it, if we can abuse it, if we can somehow ensure that we can impose our political will over the states, we will. If it turns them into political eunuchs, so be it, because we believe that all wisdom resides in Canberra.' This bill is a very shameful piece of legislation because it once again undermines the rights of the states to determine their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, as the state governments have been experiencing a cut in funding, the federal government has been increasing its own funding. Whilst we have a lot of money spent in Canberra and on Commonwealth projects, the states are losing money all the time and are having great difficulty financing such essential services as police, education and health, as I said before. This capacity to fund those essential services is being further undermined by this federal government because it is saying that it will put the funding of student unions before police, health and education. That is a very sick priority from a very sick government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994 has some deficiencies, but not in the states rights mantra&mdash;suggestions that we are always hearing, and we have just heard yet again, from the Liberal Party, in this case Senator Abetz. What this bill does is to authorise the payment of almost $15 billion of general purpose grants to the states and territories for 1994-95. It also puts in place the agreement reached at the Premiers Conference in March this year. Grants authorised by this bill include financial assistance grants, special revenue assistance grants and $350 million of identified arterial road grants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks, in the lead-up to the Darwin meeting of the Council of Australian Governments, the states have called for a larger share of the Commonwealth's payments to the states to be given as general purpose grants rather than for specific purposes. General purpose grants now comprise less than half of the total payments made to states. Prior to Labor's taking power in 1983, general purpose grants comprised almost two-thirds of all federal assistance to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of states rights mantra&mdash;and it really is a mantra; it is trotted out and repeated time after time&mdash;of the Liberal Party preaches that the rise and rise of specific purpose payments has seriously affected federal relations, with the Commonwealth increasing its powers of interference in state affairs. We in the Democrats have generally disagreed with this response. Too many of us have seen how service provision levels in the smaller states have tended to lag behind service provision levels in the larger states. For example, even after five years of Labor government, Queensland still spends far less on housing, health and welfare services than the other states, forcing volunteer agencies in that state to cope with ever increasing numbers of desperate clients and fewer and fewer resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over many years, states have shown a far greater interest in big ticket, pro-development economic expenditures at the expense of maintaining a reasonable level of community services. Take Victoria, for example. In that state, Premier Kennett can find the money to procure a grand prix but not enough to keep basic services like schools and hospital wards open. So Senator Abetz should not talk about priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the growth of specific purpose payments has been necessary because of the failure of the states to order their expenditures in accordance with some national priorities. It is not a matter of centralism or anything else. It is saying that people in Australia have a right to some national standards and those standards should not be determined by which geographical area they happen to live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states rights mantra rings very hollow, given the poor performance of most states in agreeing to national standards of community service provision and then actually meeting them. At the March COAG meeting in Hobart, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) laid out four key principles which could provide a useful starting point for a broader national agreement on rearranging federal-state issues. He called for the due recognition of the vital governmental role of the states; for increased cooperation between the Commonwealth and the states for substantial reforms; for a fully discussed reordering of relative roles and responsibilities with a view to better policy outcomes; and the retention of existing Commonwealth taxing powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the premiers have not endorsed these principles. Indeed, in Darwin a few months later, the premiers&mdash;most notably, premiers Court and Kennett&mdash;displayed a complete lack of interest in reaching any real consensus on federal reform not involving more power or money for themselves and their states. I believe that it is possible to make major progress on key federal dilemmas like vertical fiscal imbalance, tied grants and fiscal equalisation, within the Prime Minister's parameters, without a precondition of transfer of taxing powers to the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Community and Public Sector Union, which represents more than 200,000 state government employees, has recently produced what I think is quite a fascinating blueprint for change in federal-state relations. It is called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reshaping Australian Government</EMPHASIS>. In this blueprint the union calls for an end to the banal states versus Canberra power argument and a new commitment for the states and Canberra to agree on key national objectives of government, including a formal commitment to reducing unemployment and then reorganising federal grants and federal-state responsibilities accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the CPSU plan, tied grants and untied grants would be abolished, with Canberra making single line payments to the states. In return, the states would develop with the Commonwealth national planning agreements, including agreed national outcomes in nine key service sectors. This could place even stronger requirements on the states to fulfil their constitutional responsibilities in key spending areas. It would also allow the Commonwealth to review the effect of increased state taxes and charges on consumers, businesses and its own balance sheet. I include the iniquitous payroll tax in the list of state taxes in urgent need of national review. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CPSU argues that the growing gap between the needs of citizens and the delivery of state government services could be bridged by developing a citizens service charter, which would identify key service needs, services goals, citizens' rights and duties, as well as viable national benchmarks. While the Democrats might not agree with everything in this CPSU blueprint, it seems to me a fair comment that the employees of state governments are coming up with more realistic reform solutions to federal-state relations than the leaders of our state governments. For those state leaders, it is the personal, individual, political agenda that is always more important. What is urgently needed is a much wider agenda for the reform of federal and state relations than Prime Minister Keating was prepared to suggest or pay for in Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill includes a condition on the states to the effect that, if the states in turn affect the capacity of higher education institutions to provide support to student organisations, the state grant will be reduced by a necessary amount to fund the student organisation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These attempts by the Liberals to evoke notions of states rights are irrelevant in this case because state governments are not responsible for the funding of universities in Australia. Any interference with that funding represents an intrusion into something Liberals claim to defend: an intrusion into institutional autonomy. To continue to couch voluntary student unionism in language of individual freedom ignores the fact that, as a citizen, one has rights and responsibilities, such as voting, jury service, obeying laws and paying taxes, including rates and charges of all sorts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a little surprised that the federal government has not placed a further condition on the funding of the states&mdash;that is, requiring the states to take enterprise bargaining seriously. It is interesting that the Liberal Party has not thought this a matter of concern. In the most recent version of the accord, the federal government has recognised that the state government employment sector has recorded the slowest progress in enterprise bargaining. The Commonwealth committed itself to seeking to facilitate the funding of enterprise agreements if genuine bargaining was entered into, recognising the Australian public sector agreement as a reasonable model. With the exception of a smaller rise in Tasmania and an arbitrated wage rise in New South Wales, no state government has reached an enterprise agreement with its employees. </PARA>

There is growing evidence that public sector productivity has been rising&mdash;with teachers, nurses, police and public servants managing to do more with less.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland Labor government, for example, has enjoyed the benefit of $107 million in general purpose grants, which probably should have been paid out in salary increases, and almost $200 million in hospital and specific purpose grants. It is true to say that in Queensland, teachers, nurses, police officers and public servants have funded about a quarter of the Goss government's much admired budget surplus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I want to raise in relation to this bill is to note that this is the first time since 1927 that the Commonwealth has not made available general purpose capital assistance grants to the states. From 1988-89 to 1993-94 these grants fell in real terms by more than 18 per cent. I suspect this fall was part of the government's general rundown of infrastructure spending, which the Prime Minister admitted was done to help reduce the deficit without having to raise revenue through other means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise to find that the grant pool has become so small as to be insignificant and that the reform of the Loan Council arrangements allowed the Commonwealth to end any pretence that it was interested in whether the states were sufficiently resourced to fund infrastructure spending. This is despite the admission in the 1994 budget papers that most of the fall in public infrastructure over the last three decades has been because of reductions in state and territory infrastructure spending. Most of the fall in state and territory infrastructure spending has been since 1986, when the Commonwealth started dramatically reducing state general purpose grants. It is a case of pointing the finger and nobody doing anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a surprise to find that in the 1994 budget total spending on infrastructure fell by almost $700 million or 16 per cent this financial year. This is all part of the $3.4 billion halving of infrastructure spending between 1992-93 and 1997-98, which is the life of the deficit reduction strategy. This is despite the fact that in 1993 government spending on infrastructure in this country had fallen to an all-time, post-war low. I do not agree with the Prime Minister that cutting back infrastructure spending&mdash;whether it be grants to the states, funding of GBEs or capital outlays&mdash;is a fiscally responsible way to repair public finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We inherited our infrastructure, our public assets, from our parents. Those assets are depreciating. We have to pay the costs of that depreciation with additional public investment to ensure that the assets we leave to our children and grandchildren are adequate for them to enjoy a standard of living at least comparable to our own. But, across the board, skimming on infrastructure spending is making its mark. Our rail system is a shambles. Our hospitals are in urgent need of capital injection. Our universities and science laboratories are often operating with equipment up to two decades old. Short cuts are being taken. Ocean sewage outfalls are a good example. State and local governments are having trouble finding the money to do the job properly&mdash;to establish proper tertiary treatment plants using readily available technology to properly treat sewage and to stop pumping raw or semi-treated sewage into our oceans and polluting our foreshores. I do not believe the appropriate answer is to pass it all over to the private sector to take it up simply because the government will not find the money to fund its responsibility to deliver a basic level of quality services and to build on the investments of the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this bill is deficient. It provides for no quality control benchmarks or guarantees of state services. It provides for no equitable sharing of benefits between state employers and employees. It fails to provide for the future in terms of dedicated infrastructure investment. It fails to provide a reasonable base for the proper conduct of state and federal relations for the benefit of the people of Australia. But until agreement can be reached between the Commonwealth and the premiers on a better way of doing business, we will have to be content with this slightly third-rate financial legislation. </PARA>

It dealt with two matters: firstly, the continuing mismanagement of Commonwealth-state relations and, secondly, compulsory student unionism. My colleague Senator Abetz has spoken on the latter point, and I rise today to support Senator Short on the first matter, that is, the mismanagement of Commonwealth-state financial relations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter. It is a long-term, basically strategic, problem which must be addressed by the Commonwealth and the states, and it must be solved if we are to have sensible government in Australia. The essential financial problem is known as vertical fiscal imbalance, and it concerns the relationship between the Commonwealth and the state governments. The problem right now is that the Commonwealth government is not addressing this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only in very recent years that the state governments have realised the seriousness of this problem, have recognised the need for change and have started putting forward suggestions for change. All the business groups in Australia, which have been forced, thank goodness, at long last to be internationally competitive, have realised that we have to be also internationally competitive and a lot more efficient in our government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just what is this problem? The facts are that the Commonwealth collects approximately 79 per cent of total tax revenues in this country but is responsible for spending only 51 per cent. On the other hand, the states collect 17 per cent of total tax revenue but spend 43 per cent. The imbalance is the difference between revenue and spending. The remaining revenue collection is taken up by local government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the state governments rely on the Commonwealth for about half of their revenue; the actual figure is about 45 per cent. In my home state of Tasmania the figure is 54 per cent. That is the imbalance between revenue and spending between the Commonwealth and the states. It is called vertical fiscal imbalance: vertical&mdash;basically because people think in terms of the Commonwealth on the top and the states underneath; fiscal&mdash;because it is about government spending; and it is imbalanced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If governments do not have responsibility for raising money via taxes and charges, how can we expect them to behave rationally and efficiently in the spending phase? We have had a long tradition in this country of the state governments blaming the Commonwealth for all their ills, when in fact what is required is balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Good management in any organisation demands using the principle of subsidiarity. In business terms, business organisations split up their organisations into individual profit centres for the business unit. In people terms within business, we have delegation back to individuals so that at the personal level responsibility is given to individuals. The same principles must apply to governments. The business world is forced to look internationally. What are its competitors doing? What is best international practice? What happens if we look at this matter internationally?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other great federations of the Western world&mdash;West Germany, the USA and Canada&mdash;have their states and provinces basically in balance. They recognised much earlier that balance is required; in other words, revenue and expenditure need to be approximately equal within the subsidiary states and provinces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been the history in Australia? The Commonwealth has always made some form of transfer payment to the states. In the period from Federation to World War II the level of financial transfer from the Commonwealth to the states was about 11 per cent of state outlays. During World War II the income taxing powers of the states were voluntarily transferred to the Commonwealth because of the war effort, and that has continued ever since. It is that change which has led to this vertical fiscal imbalance&mdash;this imbalance between revenue and outlays between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fraser government introduced a new federalism policy by proposing income tax sharing between the Commonwealth and the states. Unfortunately, at the time the states did not recognise the strategic problems they were facing in the long term, and that policy was not used. That legislation was repealed by the Hawke government in 1989. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going back for quite some time, the Commonwealth has also used special purpose payments to interfere more and more with what is happening in the administration of the states. Today, in rough terms, about half of the payments from the Commonwealth to the states are special purpose payments. With those special purpose payments we have at least two levels of administration and control&mdash;and sometimes three when it goes down to the local government level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This duplication of administration does and must lead to very serious problems. I refer to a recent Auditor-General's report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An Audit Commentary on Aspects of Commonwealth/State Agreements</EMPHASIS>. That report highlighted many of the difficulties in the special purpose payments arena. The report found that programs suffered from a lack of clear objectives, an absence of performance indicators, and delays in financial reporting. The report also highlights that the cost sharing arrangements reduce incentives for both the Commonwealth government and the states to monitor what is actually happening and to manage properly the special purpose payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very serious problem which, I know, is still being looked at.

Our present Prime Minister, who was then on his ambitious roll to become Prime Minister, killed off that proposal and Prime Minister Hawke was forced to drop the initiative. Since then we have had a government led by Prime Minister Keating, who believes in central power.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994. This bill is designed to provide the states and territories with general purpose funding from the Commonwealth. Over many years this bill has been pretty ho-hum but since there has been a change in the complexion and make-up of state governments&mdash;there are now more Liberal governments around the country than we have seen for a long time&mdash;it has caused a bit of a bunfight with the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise the important issue of road funding in Western Australia. It is certainly no secret that Australia's roads are crying out for a greater amount of federal funding and that the Western Australian government is behind the wheel of a very vigorous campaign to rectify this problem. It is a major problem throughout Australia but, for the purposes of this debate, I want to focus on the issues relating to my state of Western Australia. I find it a very bitter pill to swallow that money which could be better spent upgrading our roads is being used to prop up student unionism where state governments have legislated for voluntary student unionism. In the case of Western Australia, that could well mean between $5 million and $10 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite objectionable that this money is being diverted when the Liberal state government in Western Australia was elected on a policy of voluntary student unionism. Yet this government is seeking to use federal taxes that could go to roads to prop up its ideological bent. The most basic translation of that is that here again the federal government is sabotaging the policies of the states and territories and imposing its will upon them. I have spoken a few times in the parliament in this last week. Unfortunately, on each occasion I have had to point out that the government is hell bent on overriding the will, not only of the state governments, but also of the people who have voted those particular state governments into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the state or territory parliaments legislate for freedom of choice and freedom of association for students, the federal government steps right in to protect its Labor mates in the guilds and the National Union of Students&mdash;its little helpers, its diligent campaigners, its budding party hacks and future members of parliament. This is all about protecting that nursery of Labor Party members, both within the party organisation and, ultimately, within the parliamentary organisation. This money should not be used in any way, shape or form for political purposes, such as propping up politically partisan organisations such as student guilds. It is meant for schools, hospitals and roads. It is not meant to prop up the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has 170,000 kilometres of public roads. Of that, 24,000 kilometres are classified as highways. Main roads and secondary roads have an estimated replacement cost of $6.5 billion. The total state road network is valued at more than $14.6 billion. The federal government collects about $10.7 billion from excise and other fuel taxes. Heaven only knows how much fuel tax has gone up in the 11 years of this government but road users are seeing less and less of that money being put back into their roads. People who are travelling extensively throughout this huge land of ours are the ones who are suffering. And it is not just those who are travelling on holidays; it is the truck drivers who are constantly on the road and the people using it for commercial purposes. But the federal government allocates $1.5 billion, or seven cents per litre, to road funding. That is just not enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983-84, Western Australia received an actual allocation of $146.08 million and only $153.78 in 1994-95. In real terms, that represents a reduction of $86 million or 36 per cent. The national highway allocation is now only 7.1 per cent of the Australian total, despite the fact that Western Australia has 25 per cent of the length of the national highway. More galling than anything else is that there are all these signs, put up at the taxpayers' expense, announcing that the highways are nationally funded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia needs an extra $145 million each year over the next 10 years to meet new demands for its road network. The national highway system alone requires $139 million over the next 10 years. Given that Perth is the second fastest growing state capital after Brisbane, this is not an unreasonable request. With a population growth rate of almost three per cent per annum, there are important implications for road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what will happen over the next two decades, a period when Western Australian roads need replacement? Roads typically require replacement or rehabilitation after 40 years of use. Over the next 10 years about 30 per cent of Western Australia's roads will have a pavement age of more than 40  years. Currently, about five per cent are of this age. It would require an annual road budget of $200 million per year over 10 years to avoid this problem but that is not within the means of the present road budget. It is likely to be even further out of reach if the federal government starts syphoning money away from state and territory governments and into student unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arterial roads need to be constructed to provide necessary links to services and to complement public transport. Increases of 10 per cent in road freight have put pressure on the total infrastructure and the trend looks set to continue on an upward spiral. Deregulation of land freight transport threatens to place pressure on the existing infrastructure and increase the demand for new roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, what is the government doing about this situation? It is doing absolutely nothing. Road accidents cost Western Australia $900 million per annum. That is despite the fact that there has been a marked improvement in Western Australia's road safety performance in recent years. Despite increased allocations in the last two state budgets, Western Australia cannot meet the shortfall in funding on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 the Western Australian government allocated an additional $35 million to the roads budget. In 1994-95 it was increased again by $26 million. Previously tied national arterial funds which are now untied are still being allocated to Western Australian roads. But road funds in Western Australia have continued to decline in real terms and this government must be held responsible. Until it wakes up to the fact that by cutting road funding it is increasing the risk of serious accident and creating a harder and harder life for people who use country roads, nothing will improve. Good roads lead to economic development, employment, environmental protection and reduction in road trauma. When will the government realise that all these things hinge on those factors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Fix Australia Fix the Roads campaign, run by the Western Australian state government, has the strong support of the Royal Automobile Club of Western Australia, the Western Australian Police Department, the Livestock Transporters Association, the Pastoralists and Graziers Association, the Western Australian Farmers Federation, the Main Roads Department of Western Australian, the Western Australian Department of Transport and the Western Australian Municipal Association. With that type of support, why cannot this government see that it needs to start putting in its contribution and stop decreasing Western Australia's real term allocation to road funding?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign has also been joined by the Australian Roads Federation of Western Australian, the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Tourism Industry Association of Western Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very important issue that Mr Wran raised yesterday and that Senator Carr raises here this afternoon. I will be seeking to make copies, at least of the executive summary of the report, available to all senators and members, because I think this is an important issue about which many members have a serious and continuing interest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that the government and Mr Wran regard APEC as a very high priority. It is a region that accounts for 75 per cent of Australia's exports. The report of the Eminent Persons Group that Mr Wran was involved with, the release of which he was involved with in Australia yesterday, will serve to very much reinforce the role of APEC at the centre of the future for the Asia-Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report of the EPG, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Achieving the APEC vision</EMPHASIS>, presents challenging and specific proposals to Australia and Australians and the rest of the region on how the long-term vision of free trade in the Asia-Pacific might be achieved. It proposes a blueprint for trade liberalisation in APEC, it charts a strategic course into the next century and it recognises that trade and investment liberalisation will play a big role in determining the region's economic success well into the next century&mdash;2020, they are talking about. It is also a contribution to the role of APEC in capitalising on that web of political and economic relations that are developing in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not the only proposal that will go to leaders at their meeting in November about the prospects for APEC. There will also be a report from the Pacific Business Forum, an initiative Mr Keating took last year at Seattle, where the business leaders from around the region will also be making a report. We expect those two reports together to challenge the APEC economies to cooperate more closely, more intensively and across an increasingly broad spectrum of issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is a major challenge for us all, it has the potential to deliver immense dividends for regional prosperity. The centrepiece of the report is its proposal for free trade in APEC within the region by the year 2020. If this goal could be achieved within the timetable they have set out or otherwise, it would substantially add to the economic growth of the region and, therefore, the economic opportunities for Australian business and the job opportunities for Australian citizens. So it is a very important report. It sets out important principles about encouraging unilateral liberalisation, about a commitment to reduce barriers to non-APEC countries, about the possibility of extending benefits of APEC liberalisation to non-member countries and, of course, about leaving it open to APEC members to extend their liberalisation to non-members. It makes a number of practical proposals also about enhancing trade and investment flows&mdash;so-called trade facilitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a report that we warmly welcome and with which we are very impressed. We support strongly the report's recommendations about setting a target date for free trade for the region. It has important implications for every Australian. I think it could well deliver very substantial benefits for Australian industry, greatly expanding economic opportunities in the Asia-Pacific. We do not underestimate the challenge it presents to us and to the other economies of the region, but I think it will ultimately come to be seen as representing the interests of each country as well as of the region as a whole. The trade liberalisation thrust that is under debate is important. The EPG report that Senator Carr refers to will make an important contribution to that.</PARA>

But is it not true that two existing government tax measures&mdash;namely, the $1.6 billion tax concession for full dividend imputation and the proposed imposition of the FBT on employee share plans&mdash;actually fail already the Treasurer's own savings test and in fact contribute to reduced national savings?

He certainly made a remark of that character in a speech he delivered to the Life Insurance Federation of Australia last May. The main strategy for dealing with national savings that the government identifies is the medium term deficit reduction strategy. That strategy is continuing on track. It is the key device by which we believe the issues of national savings can be addressed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has in mind how it will respond to that.

We want to make sure that tax concessions do not undermine those objectives. The third criteria is the equity of such schemes in terms of their effect on the progressivity of the tax system.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Denman for her question. Next week I will be spending a day with Senator Denman in northern Tasmania, visiting small businesses and listening to the issues raised by them. It is something that opposition senators show no interest in, other than Senator Boswell, who does raise questions about small business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> survey was released earlier this week. It is a survey that has already established itself as having a good track record and credibility. It is a survey taken every quarter of 1,000 metropolitan and regional small businesses with fewer than 20 employees. It covers small businesses across a broad spectrum of services&mdash;manufacturing, construction, wholesale, retail, transport and finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures released on Tuesday show that small business confidence in their prospects over the next 12 months remains high and unchanged since the beginning of 1994; 57 per cent of respondents were fairly confident; and a further 18 per cent were extremely confident, giving a total of 75 per cent expressing confidence in their prospects for the next 12 months. So three-quarters of businesses surveyed expressed confidence and only 10 per cent are worried about the next 12 months. Small business confidence is highest in the finance and business services sector, with 80 per cent expressing confidence. What is interesting to note is that the divergence between the sectors is now much reduced; that is, all are now confident about the future and to a much greater degree.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business sales growth remained strong over the three months to July, with a net 28 per cent of small businesses surveyed reporting sales increases. This was a slightly smaller net increase than in the preceding three-month period, but well above the figure for the same period in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Employment in small businesses surveyed rose by a reported 1.5 per cent in the three months to July. This is confirmed by the survey out today by DEET that showed that skilled employment vacancies for the preceding quarter were up by over 60 per cent on the same period last year. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Yellow Pages</EMPHASIS> small business survey the strongest employment came in the manufacturing sector, with a net 10 per cent of businesses recording increases. Again, it is very encouraging for government policy that manufacturing is showing such a strong growth rate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is another indication that the economic recovery is well under way. This survey matches the quarterly accounts figures released earlier this week. As I say, it matches the DEET figures on skilled vacancies. All in all, small business is growing very strongly. Confidence is high. It augurs well for the long-term future of business in Australia and emphasises that small business is leading the way in creating economic confidence in Australia.</PARA>

Why are Australian customs requirements so harsh when both Australia and the US are members of GATT and when the Hawaiian pineapple industry can instigate an anti-dumping action which will see duties imposed at the rate of 138 per cent after a five-month investigation and when domestic prices have dropped by 10 per cent over the last year? Why is this the case when Australian producers under customs requirements have to suffer material injury for three successive years and have a 20 per cent market loss before commencing an anti-dumping action, as well as suffering the uncertainties arising from challenges to duties at any time within the three-year period, and when duties are suspended, as is presently happening in the Australian tomato industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information I have received for the Senate, and particularly for Senator Boswell, from my department is as follows: it is not true that Australian producers must suffer material injury for three successive years in order to lodge an anti-dumping application; nor is it true that there must be a 20 per cent market loss for an action to be commenced.

I do not say that such a ruling does not exist, but my understanding is that the bureau is not aware of one at this moment. I will ask the bureau to check.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The practices are widely different between different countries. While it is true, as Senator Bourne said in her question, that the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Canada keep their forms, Australia does not; nor do Germany, Italy, Japan or the Netherlands. The practice varies according to the country. Usually the reason why it is different is each country's view of confidentiality and privacy matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the ABS is concerned to respect Australian views of high levels of privacy and confidentiality in dealing with the census and has regard to national standards in that sense. I also know that the ABS's view is that, if Australian citizens think that the original forms are maintained with their names, addresses, et cetera on them, that may degrade the quality of the census itself because people will be disinclined to reply to the census and give full information if they think that their privacy may at some time be invaded. It is for that reason that the bureau disposes of the forms after they have been collated and the information which is contained therein has been properly programmed and kept.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the question concerns national resources information. I admit that is true; indeed, that is the purpose of the census. But researchers can have access to the findings of the census without actually going to the original returned forms of the people being surveyed. I think Senator Bourne will find that nearly all of the research requirements that people may have can be best met that way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Bourne cites the cost figures, which I understand to be the cost figures of collecting the census itself. One has to offset the need for privacy, the respect of privacy, and whether people will respond if they believe the forms are not disposed of, against the cost of disposal of the forms in the end.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Devereux because one of the key questions is access to finance by small to medium sized companies in Australia and whether the market is satisfactorily responsive to financing these by this strata of industry. This was something, of course, that the government recognised and did something about in the white paper, released in May of this year. We did so by, among other things, introducing changes to the pooled development funds program. We provided a tax deduction for pooled developed funds down from 25 per cent to 15 per cent, so that the level of tax paid was at 15 per cent for pooled development funds where they were aimed at investing those funds in small to medium sized companies in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to see what the response to that has been. My department advised me that since that announcement it has received between 50 and 60 inquiries per week about how one goes about setting up pooled development funds and how the supply of fund investments can help small to medium sized companies. That is a vastly increased rate of inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More importantly though, the pooled development funds authority has now registered 17 pooled development funds and has combined intentions to raise $340 million to help finance the needs of small to medium sized business. This is an area that is growing quite rapidly. These funds will be used to meet, of course, the essential long-term equity financing needs of SMEs. It should be remembered that traditional finance institutions in the past have been reluctant to provide this sort of finance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the hopes for pooled development funds was that they would look at particular industries or indeed at particular locations. Of the 17 that have been now registered one is quite an interesting fund: the Hunter region pooled development fund called Hunter First, which was registered in July and plans to raise $10 million for Hunter region based investors and superannuation funds and to service the area of Newcastle.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hunter First considers that there is an opportunity to raise funds for investment in a region that is both an export hub and poised to grow strongly in the next decade. Hunter First plans to invest in Hunter based companies which have an asset base of between $5 million and $50 million. This will allow those companies to grow their business in a profitable and financial way. It shows that the settings that the government introduced in pooled development funds to meet the need for small to medium sized companies for capital are beginning to pay dividends and that the pool from which these small to medium sized companies can draw is now deepening and enriching as we go.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is very important that the consumers appreciate that, while the opposition may carp and criticise, we are delivering the changes of competition, encouraging those products to become cheaper, and allowing the private health funds to be unregulated and to get on with talking to hospitals and doctors to reduce the cost of the visit to hospital and to make consumers much better off. There are some other protections we keep in the system, particularly community rating, to make sure that we protect those people who may have a bigger demand on the system.

<PARA>That is Dr Nelson of the AMA&mdash;`consumer rights are at the margin of the main game.' I do not believe the consumers of Australia will have that response to falling premium costs and protection for their health. Dr Brendan Nelson says that consumer concerns are at the margin of the main game. He is about to learn that the consumers, the people of Australia, are the main game. That is what this package is about. It is about putting those consumers at the centre of private health insurance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. I have already answered this, but I am certainly happy to tell Senator Chapman again. The gap insurance that the AMA argues for and that doctors have argued for in the past was an open-ended gap&mdash;above the 25 per cent that is currently provided to the top of the medical benefits schedule. This package says that, provided the doctors agree with the private health funds that there be no further out-of-pocket expenses, then the insurance companies, provided they can get a good price for consumers, will be allowed to cover a patient for 100 per cent&mdash;an entirely different understanding of gap. It is about pegging the prices down, not pushing the prices up. People do need to know; certainly the consumers need to know. And I hope that Senator Chapman would not want to misrepresent the facts of these changes to the electors anywhere, let alone in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is different because it is a package of reforms. It allows the private health insurance industry to negotiate with doctors so as to put, if you like, a cap on the price. The doctors have agreed not to charge above that, or there will not be 100 per cent cover. We know what the community wants. People in the community want private health insurance that protects them from bills. What they have got at the moment is private health that is costing them more and more for premiums and giving them only bigger and bigger bills. If the private health insurance industry seizes this opportunity and protects against gap cover, it will be very different from the sort that pushes up fees. It will be the kind of gap cover that pegs fees.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Trying to explain this to Senator Chapman will be difficult. I will have another shot. What the government is saying is that if private health insurers can get an agreement with doctors to set a limit on their fees so that the private health insurers can set a premium that will be reducing and an attractive product in the market, then 100 per cent cover, including whatever gap there might be, will be acceptable. The government is not saying that cannot happen any more. It is saying to private insurance companies, `If you can negotiate a package that is competitive in the marketplace and pegged so that the consumer does not have to pay more, then that is allowed&mdash;go for it.' But that is entirely different from the gap that the government has opposed in the past that was open-ended and that was only going to be an inducement to push fees up.

I have examined the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcript of question time yesterday and also considered precedents contained in past Presidents' rulings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The points of order raised during the minister's answer were to the effect that the minister was adversely reflecting on a member of the House of Representatives by making an allegation that the member had addressed a meeting of an organisation which was characterised as an extremist organisation. Standing order 193(3) prohibits offensive words, imputations of improper motives and personal reflections on members of either house of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An examination of the minister's answer prior to my ruling indicates that he did not at that stage go beyond alleging that the member had knowingly addressed a meeting of the organisation concerned. My ruling was to the effect that the minister was making an allegation as to a matter of fact, namely, that the member had knowingly addressed a meeting of the organisation; that the points of order, in effect, were challenging the truth of that allegation; that while inferences could be drawn from the alleged matter of fact, it was not for the chair to judge the truth of the allegation; and that there were other avenues by which the truth of the allegation could be challenged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ruling indicated that this was not a case of offensive words being used against a member of either house or of imputations of improper motives or personal reflections, but a case of an allegation of a matter of fact, the truth of which could be challenged by other senators. This distinction between an allegation of a matter of fact as to a member's activities and an adverse reflection on a member&mdash;for example, by attributing to a member particular views&mdash;has been consistently drawn by past Presidents, at least since a ruling made in 1917.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The precedents of rulings of Presidents under standing order 193(3) and its predecessor standing order indicate that in no case has a President ruled out of order a mere allegation of a matter of fact such as the one under consideration here. Presidents have consistently ruled that it is not for the chair to judge the truth of senators' statements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone asked whether the ruling meant that it is acceptable to draw inferences from statements about matters of fact. If an inference is drawn from a statement of a matter of fact, it is for the chair to judge whether the inference contravenes standing order 193. The ruling indicated that the possibility of inferences being drawn from an allegation of a matter of fact is not a sufficient basis for the chair to find a contravention of standing order 193(3).</PARA>

It is not my recollection at all that the point of order that was being taken simply related to the allegation of fact as to what Mr Downer had attended. Rather, the point of order and the subsequent speakers in favour, if you like, on this side with respect to that point of order were arguing that inferences were being drawn from the allegation of fact whether it was true or not&mdash;that is, inferences were being drawn on that side with respect to Mr Downer.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I put to you simply was that I believed inferences were being drawn, and I thought it was unacceptable for you to say that you were not in a position to judge.

There is a clear distinction between that. If Senator Vanstone does not understand that, I suggest we have a discussion about it later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators in the past have made such accusations&mdash;for example, that a senator or member attended a meeting of the Communist Party.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>It is my opinion that that explanation is less than adequate. This matter has been the cause of considerable confusion in the community, the government and the Public Service, and between employers and employees in general. My interest in this matter arises from a situation, representative of situations across Australia, that was brought to my attention regarding an employee of the Australian Electoral Commission. The employee was sent a letter which, in order to properly illustrate the situation, needs to be quoted fully. I think it is in the interests of the Senate and the nation that this matter be resolved and the inadequacies of what the government has done here be exposed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the question I placed on notice on 17 May. I asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)Is it a fact that the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) has written to polling officials over the age of 65 terminating their employment and quoting reasons relating to the Commonwealth's superannuation and compensation obligations; if so, on what basis and with what authority?</PARA>
<PARA>I further asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)Given that the AEC itself acknowledges that `this might be a discriminatory practice', does its action contravene the ban on age discrimination inserted by the Australian Democrats into the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993; if not, why not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)What action will be taken to reverse the AEC's decision.</PARA>
<PARA>I think all honourable senators would agree that the explanation given by the Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services&mdash;that the matter was referred to Industrial Relations and then to Administrative Services, which is looking for advice from Attorney-General's&mdash;indicates a great deal of confusion about what should be done here. If there was some sort of confusion, why is this pre-emptive strike being undertaken by AEC? Why is it that AEC has taken it upon itself to take the action which, when I quote from its letter, speaks for itself?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the best thing I can do is quote the letter fully. The letter is addressed to a particular person&mdash;the name is not necessary. Under the heading `Polling duties: employment over the age of 65', the divisional returning officer writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have recently received a notice from my Central Office regarding the conditions of employment for the engagement of polling officials and other staff under the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The text of this notice includes the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The AEC is a Commonwealth employer and is bound by obligations imposed under Commonwealth legislation and Commonwealth industrial awards. This is the case even where there may exist State legislation or inconsistent Commonwealth legislation which prohibits certain practices, as is the case in discrimination legislation. Under Commonwealth legislation, in particular that relating to legal obligations imposed to pay superannuation benefits and to cover employees for compensation, persons over the age of 65 years are specifically excluded, despite a view that this might be a discriminatory practice."</PARA>
<PARA>The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the above information, as you have attained the age of 65 years, I will be unable to offer you employment on polling duties again.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all very well. That is a statement of opinion from the divisional returning officer with advice from his central office quoted. But the letter continues&mdash;and this is the part which is really almost offensive. Having said that the person is no good any more and to get lost, the writer then had the cheek to write:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would appreciate your advice as to whether any of your staff at Election 93 measure up as Officer-in-Charge or 2IC material. I attach a copy of your staff assessment sheet to refresh your memory and a post-free envelope for your reply.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, `Go away, but tell us who is going to replace you.' On the strength of that, I asked the question which I have already quoted. Confusion reigned within government ranks and no answer was forthcoming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confusion continues, I would suggest, because in an article by Mark Davis in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> we are told that when it comes to age discrimination in employment, the federal government's attitude is apparently `do as I say, not as I do'. It was revealed that the government in fact took a case to the industrial relations court arguing against itself, its own legislation. The government sought a ruling in respect of its action of dismissing a court reporter with the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;remember, this is the crowd it was seeking advice from&mdash;who was seeking reinstatement after being compulsorily retired when she turned 65 earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told the name of the employee and we are told that she was told that she was employed under the Public Service Act. The government opposed her petition to the industrial relations court. It maintained that she had lodged an unfair dismissal claim, arguing that her dismissal breached the Industrial Relations Act because it was based on her age. But the counsel for the government argued that the age discrimination provisions did not apply to people employed under the Public Service Act. I am absolutely confounded by that. As a matter of fact, on 9 December I moved an amendment to the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. That amendment, which was supported by the government, stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 21, page 16, after proposed subsection 170CA(1), insert the following subsection:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"`(1A) Without limiting subsection (1), the references in paragraph 170DF(1)(e) to sexual preference, age and physical or mental disability, have been included in order to give effect, or further effect, to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a)the Convention concerning Discrimination in respect of Employment and Occupation, a copy of the English text of which is set out in Schedule 1 to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)the Recommendation referred to in paragraph 170BA(c). ".</PARA>
<PARA>At the time I said that the amendment inserts new grounds in the criteria under which employment can be terminated. It inserts a new subsection. I said at the time that, without reading the whole of the amendment, it is again relevant to discrimination. The government supported that. It became part of an act of parliament&mdash;law of the land. We find this same government&mdash;which at the moment is seeking advice from the Attorney-General's Department&mdash;opposing its own legislation, and with regard to a matter taken up by an employee of the Attorney-General's Department. It is so confusing and so hypocritical. I think it is a matter of great importance that answers to questions about it should be given to this chamber rapidly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did that happen on one occasion, but Senator Spindler moved an amendment which had a similar effect consequentially&mdash;and thoroughly, in Senator Spindler's usual manner. I repeat that this was not just a matter of my coming in here quietly and slipping in a little amendment which nobody else noticed. It was a matter of some consistency of argument throughout the consideration and of a consistent approach adopted by this party&mdash;with, I must say, some degree of publicity and a great deal of negotiation with the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a case of saying, `We will slip this one through quietly,' and certain members of the government did not notice what was going on. In fact, I think there may have been a lack of communication. I wonder whether the left hand is trying to deceive the right hand in this government. Whatever the case may be, the result is a great deal of confusion in the community and a great deal of opportunity for people to accuse the government of suggesting there is one rule for private enterprise and one rule for government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to specific aged care dementia facilities.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a timely question because it is National Alzheimer's Week from 4 to 10 September. Senator Crowley obviously had not been briefed in any way, did not understand the question I was asking and was bowled out. Dementia is a devastating disease and is not to be laughed about. Some people may have watched <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mother and Son</EMPHASIS> and found it very amusing. But I am facing a situation in my family at the moment where my mother is caring for my stepfather who has dementia. It is a 24 hours a day, seven days a week job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dementia involves confusion and loss of memory, especially short-term memory. It is often accompanied with delusions, depression, agitation, sleeplessness, wandering, aggression and uninhibited, socially unacceptable behaviour. It means that the carer is constantly watching because the person may, for example, try to light an electric stove with a match. Dementia sufferers are constantly being monitored because they are likely to wander. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As carers know, it is not like any other disease. Roberta Gripton from the Alzheimers Association (WA) described dementia as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been called the living death. And this is really what happens. The person in later stages is there in body but their personality has gone. It is not the same person.</PARA>
<PARA>One of my very good friends from childhood is married to a man who is 52. He has full-blown onset dementia. When I call and ask for my friend by name, he says, `Yes, that's me'. He has no idea who he is. She has no facility into which to place him. She has him in an inappropriate facility for one day a week, she has him in a HACC program another day, and she locks him up for the other three days so that she can go to work and provide for her three children. That is the sort of situation we are facing. People as young as 46, 47 and 52 have Alzheimers type dementia. Then there is senile dementia which expresses itself in very similar ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has consistently avoided the compelling need for funding dementia specific facilities. People with dementia cannot appropriately be placed in nursing homes. If they are fit, active and not so frail that they are bedbound, they wander, they interfere with other people's business and they can go into another resident's room and rummage through the drawers. We have to think about the rights of residents who do not have dementia but are in a nursing home because they are frail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many doctors and people who work in nursing home facilities tell us that ambulant residents who have dementia have to be restrained either physically or with drugs. When they are restrained with drugs there is an increased likelihood that they will be incontinent and have falls and that therefore their dependency is increased. Those people end up on a higher dependency level and cost much more than they would cost in a dementia specific facility. Their quality of life is reduced, as is that of the people who live with them in the nursing home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to go into a nursing home to see a mismatch between frail aged residents and those with dementia. We can see the strains that it places on the staff, on the residents who have dementia, and on the other residents who do not have dementia. </PARA>

She moved to Strathdon Lodge and three months later she was able to engage in some activities of daily living, she was speaking again, and she had a quality of life. Another person had been inappropriately placed in a nursing home. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Ellison this day, relating to a claim before the Native Title Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>I called it the No. 1 claim because a second claim is pending which has been lodged with the National Native Title Tribunal but has not yet been accepted. The second claim involves an area of 7,600 square kilometres in and around Kununurra and covers predominantly pastoral leases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I asked today related to how claims like this will be handled. As I mentioned, over 120 companies and individuals have sought to be made a party to the first claim. If the National Native Title Tribunal operates in relation to this claim as it intends to operate with the Yawuru claim&mdash;that is, to deal with each respondent individually&mdash;we will be facing an inordinate delay in resolving this claim. We would have 120 respondents effectively conducting 120 separate cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this issue out of my concern for exactly how these claims will be handled. I have great faith in Mr Justice French and the staff that he has assisting him in relation to the National Native Title Tribunal. However, human beings can only do so much. We have a vast judicial system which has enough trouble keeping abreast with the system that we have in place. It was during the debate on the Native Title Act that the coalition pointed out to the government the practical difficulties with this act. The coalition is again pointing out the practical difficulties in relation to the land acquisition fund. Once again, we are being ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this point to illustrate to the Senate the reality of the operation of this act. To date, not one claim has been resolved. In Western Australia, we have 10 claims on the boil; one claim&mdash;from the Martu people&mdash;covers an area of 125,000 square kilometres in that state. These claims are not progressing quickly. They are involved and complex. I think it is high time that the government took stock of the situation and addressed it appropriately instead of trying to fob it off and sweep it under the carpet. This is not going to go away. We are now in September. The Native Title Act was passed in December last year. We have not yet advanced to the situation where we have solved one claim. We have claims forthcoming which look like taking years to settle. Something has to be done. The government cannot just turn a blind eye to this situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred only to Western Australia. I have not even touched on the claims in the other states and the Northern Territory. I have only given a picture of the difficulty in Western Australia. If we multiply that by several orders, we can see the national picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to Mr Justice French's report in October where, no doubt, he will recommend some sensible amendments to the act. I hope that the government is not swayed by the politics of this issue but looks at the reality and practicality of these matters. There are now pastoral leases under a cloud due to these claims, and more than one national park is the subject of a claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems are not going to go away. They were problems that the coalition highlighted in December last year but which were fobbed off. I ask honourable senators to remember this when the coalition puts forward its amendments to the land acquisition fund. Our amendments are sensible and practical and might afford some justice to the intended recipients. They are not just an ideological approach to a problem, an approach which is fraught with danger and difficulty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too want to speak on this debate to take note of the answer by Senator Collins, as Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), in response to Senator Ellison's question about this land claim. There are a number of issues which also flow from the minister's answer. When there are areas of hundreds of thousands of square kilometres being claimed under the Native Title Act, it raises another important issue under the land fund bill which is currently being debated in the other place. The object was made quite clear in the preamble to the Native Title Act. It says that a land fund will be established to ensure that the 95 per cent of Aboriginal people who have been informed will not be able to benefit because of native title claims will be directed to those areas where native title claims are not made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there are hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of country in the Kimberley, Pilbara and Goldfields regions of Western Australia&mdash;and, of course, areas right across our great land&mdash;that are already the subject of native title claims, it raises some important issues about how the land fund will work. It again focuses our attention on the lack of consultation that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs have had in relation to the drafting of this deeply flawed bill which the coalition is constructively seeking to reform by ensuring that it is more focused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues that I think is crucially important and should be brought forward in response to this minister's answer to Senator Ellison's question is the sort of consultation that took place in the drafting of the so-called land fund bill. The Joint Committee on Native Title has just completed two weeks of hearings in northern Queensland, northern New South Wales and up the coast of New South Wales. The committee met with something like 30 Aboriginal organisations which had an interest in the native title legislation and the land fund. Those groups would have incorporated in excess of 100 Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders. Of those hundreds of people with whom the committee came into contact, two or three or four had had consultation on this land fund bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that it is an act of absolute sanctimony for the minister in the other place, Mr Tickner, to claim that he can reject the coalition's reforms to this bill within a period of three or four minutes of having seen those reforms and to then say that he has done so on behalf of the Aboriginal people. Not only had he not spoken to the Aboriginal people in the period during drafting of the land fund bill up to its introduction in the House of Representatives in June but he did not do so during the winter recess. Nor during the three or four minutes consideration he gave to the opposition's reforms to the land fund bill could he have spoken to any Aboriginals or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian people should be made well aware that the government's decision on the land fund bill is not only a slap in the face to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. It is also a slap in the face to the whole Australian electorate which genuinely wants to see an approach to Aboriginal affairs that actually directs benefits to those people who are most disadvantaged, namely, those Aboriginals who have very little access to land and, specifically, those who cannot benefit under the provisions of the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government pretends to represent the views of Aboriginal people when it says no to reforms of the bill. That is not only sad; it is also cynical. The government took a political decision not to look at any reforms to its bill. To oppose those reforms for cynical, political reasons and not to look at ways of amending and improving the bill, we can only presume that Mr Keating thinks that the land fund bill is a 10, it is perfect, and cannot be reformed. We know that if consultations were held with a wide cross-section of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities around Australia, we would find out that is just not the case. </PARA>

<PARA>Yesterday in the Dail, the Irish parliament, in an historic speech, the Irish Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A long nightmare is coming to an end, where the legacy of history went so tragically wrong. While the IRA like others must have responsibility for their actions, and those that have had terrible human consequences, it would be simplistic to make them solely responsible for the national disaster that has struck this island over the last 25 years, holding the whole country back and poisoning relations even further in the North of Ireland.</PARA>
<PARA>The foreign minister, Dick Spring, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On this occasion our thoughts are first and foremost with the people of Northern Ireland. They have never known a society free from violence. For the first time we can realistically hope that that goal can be attained. There is a duty on all sides to avail of the opportunity which now opens up, and with patience, sensitivity and generosity to reach out for agreement, based on equal respect for the rights and aspirations of both traditions in Ireland and the need for both to have satisfactory expression and protection.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Spring went on later to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are always manifest risks and difficulties inherent in any new beginning. The task of construction and healing wounds after decades of violence is a daunting one that will test all our energies and skills. For the Republican movement, years of political isolation will not be an easy legacy to transcend. Permanent renunciation of violence, maintained and firmly adhered to, will open many doors. It will pave the way for truly inclusive negotiations and provide a historic opportunity to begin the work of healing the misunderstandings and antagonisms which have so damaged relationships on this island and between these islands over the centuries.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, you would be aware of my intimate interest in this. The town of my birth is only 10 miles from the border that divides not only the province of Ulster but the island of Ireland. So I have a great interest in what is happening on the other side of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this chamber I would like to pay tribute to the people who have worked towards this historic declaration by the Irish Republican Army on 31 August. Of course, tribute must go to the Irish Prime Minister, Albert Reynolds, and his foreign minister, Dick Spring, but equal tribute must be paid to the British Prime Minister, John Major, and his officials and ministers, in particular, the former Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr Peter Brooke. Tribute must also be paid to one of the leaders of the Sinn Fein movement in Ireland, Mr Gerry Adams, and also the leader of the Unionist Party, Mr Molyneaux, without whose cooperation this statement would not have been possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I was to single out an individual for tribute on this historic occasion, it would be the leader of the SDLP, the Social Democratic Labor Party in Northern Ireland, who is a member in Westminster and a member of the European Parliament, John Hume. John has worked tirelessly over a period of more than 25 years to see 31 August 1994 come to fruition. Hopefully, he will be a contender for a major international peace prize. It was Hume who brought Adams and others to the negotiating table. On a number of occasions he acted as an intermediary when there were blockages on both sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the Australian government and the Australian people can make some contribution to the very difficult task that lies ahead in bringing peace to that troubled province and troubled island, perhaps by making a financial contribution to the Ireland Fund.

<PARA>The little exercise in which this parliament has been engaged in recent times concerning the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer) addressing a certain meeting in South Australia is a very sad reflection. It has been an attempt by the Labor Party to smear my leader and to assert a degree of guilt by association. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has been shown today is that one should not throw stones if one lives in glass houses. Indeed, the Labor Party is the kettle trying to call the pot black.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, more importantly than just addressing the League of Rights, which allegedly my leader has done and Mr Campbell, the member for Kalgoorlie, has done, we now have a situation where the Labor opposition leader in Western Australia has issued invitations to the Australian Heritage Society, which proudly says that it is a subsidiary of the League of Rights in this country. Mr Ian Taylor, the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, sent this invitation for morning tea to these members and indicated that they could RSVP on the telephone number of the Leader of the Opposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, we have a Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who says that his pin-up boy in politics is none other than Jack Lang. What were Jack Lang's policies? The Prime Minister would be associated with Jack Lang all the time. He moved within the New South Wales division of the Labor Party to allow Jack Lang back into the Labor Party. What were Jack Lang's policies in relation to Jewish immigration? They are in Jack Lang's memoirs; they are in his book. We all know that he was opposed to Jewish immigration because Jews engaged in a terrible business of the black market, according to Jack Lang&mdash;a clear anti-Semitic embraced by Paul Keating, our Prime Minister. Yet the Prime Minister and the Labor Party have the audacity to parade around this country saying that the Leader of the Opposition is guilty by association. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege today to make a few comments in relation to the government's response to the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission's report on South Sea Islanders and their position in Australia. The report is entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Call for Recognition</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 15,000 to 20,000 Australian South Sea Islanders are descendants of over 60,000 South Sea Islanders recruited mainly from Vanuatu and the Solomon Islands in the latter half of the 19th century. They were recruited to work on the farms in the then emerging sugar industry in the North Queensland area. Although since that time they have spread throughout north and central Queensland and into the capital cities, a great many of them still live in the regions which their descendants settled over 100 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian South Sea Islanders are a distinct ethnic group, but until now they have not been officially recognised in Australia. South Sea Islanders in Australia have suffered from a century of discrimination and harsh treatment, and this treatment and discrimination is detailed very well in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many South Sea Islanders, or kanakas as they were called, were originally brought to Australia in most instances against their will. They were contracted at very low remuneration for two or three years. Although they were referred to as `indentured' workers, they were often treated little better than slaves. In fact, many South Sea Islander descendants today refer to their ancestors as having been slaves. The Queensland Legislative Assembly was in fact told in 1884:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evil of coloured labour was that it placed the servile labourer too much under the control of the white man. They might not call it slavery, but it was akin to it&mdash;cousin to it; and unless they were very careful&mdash;indentured service would soon denigrate to slavery.</PARA>
<PARA>South Sea Islanders lived under extreme hardship where physical punishment was common. Typical of the attitude of the day was a statement in the Charters Towers <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>, in its edition of 29 December 1883, which warned that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Kanakas, like other dark races, cannot understand too much kindness and will be much more obedient if inspired by a sense of fear than if pampered.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that was the attitude of that time to the South Sea Islander indentured workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of the hardships of these indentured labourers, many of them signed up again. They did so because it gave them an opportunity to earn more money than the new recruits were getting and, as well, some of them found it quite difficult to return to their own villages in the Pacific where they no longer fitted in. Between 1904 and 1906 many of them were deported under what was then a white Australia policy. The history books contain many details of attempts by South Sea Islanders to escape deportation back to what was at one stage their homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the South Sea Islanders did suffer tremendously in those times from deprivation and very harsh conditions. Some, however, were well treated. Those who remained in Australia adapted to European customs. They had lived for so long away from their native islands that North Queensland became their home. Of course, for many of their descendants North Queensland has been and continues to be their home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission report says that the labour movement, particularly the AWU, was a vehement opponent of South Sea Islanders, and they were actually refused membership of the union. The AWU applied to have only union members working in the sugar industry to prevent kanakas working in the industry. It required that a worker be a union member to work in the industry, but it would not let the South Sea Islanders join the union. In fact, in 1919 the Queensland Industrial Court's sugar award banned what it called `coloured people' from canecutting after June of that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In spite of that, it is true to say that the great Queensland sugar industry was built on the backs of the forebears of today's Australian South Sea Islanders. I remember that when I first went to the Burdekin district in North Queensland in 1957 there were canecutters from many different walks of life. It was interesting to see how the district prospered from the influence of the very many different racial groups that had moved into the area to cut the cane by hand. There were a lot of Italians, Spanish and South Sea Islanders. It became a very prosperous area. In those days a lot of the canecutters were making big money cutting cane by hand and became wealthy. Some of them bought farms. Most of them had good houses in the towns and prospered in our district. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was not a lot of discrimination. There were so many different racial groups that there was little room for or interest in discrimination. I remember that a lot of the South Sea Islander kids who went to school with me, who were friends of mine and played a lot of sport with me, lived in houses in the towns and were treated as part of the community, along with the Italians, Spanish, Greeks and many other people who came to the cane fields in those days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the commission's report says, the hardship and racial discrimination faced by South Sea Islanders in Australia over the last century are major factors contributing to the state of disadvantage they are in today. It is interesting to note a comment made by a recently elected councillor on the Burdekin Shire Council who is also a member of the Burdekin South Sea Islander community, Mrs Marlene Henaway, that South Sea Islanders had been discriminated against for a long time. She goes on to make the quite interesting comment that they were also discriminated against by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These South Sea Islanders in the north are a very proud and decent people who look after their own, help each other and are very fine citizens of the communities they live in. Many of them are very Christian, not only in name but in deed as well. They are people who have not wanted a lot and in many cases have not wanted government assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember an incident when I was practising law with a firm in the Burdekin that involved some longstanding clients of South Sea Islander origin who used to do a lot of work with us. Legal service had been granted to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders by the Queensland government without charge; another firm of solicitors in town had the government contract for the work. At one stage I said to our clients, perhaps rather insensitively, that while I was very keen to accept their work and take their money, it might be in their own interest to go down and receive free legal aid. They were quite offended by that and said that they were prepared to pay for their legal work, just as they paid for everything else. They wanted to be treated as ordinary members of the community and did not want to be singled out. That incident has always remained in my mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as a general rule, South Sea Islanders in Australia have been discriminated against and disadvantaged. A recent census taken as part of a Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission investigation showed that they are amongst one of the poorest groups in Australia and face below average employment, health and education. Some of the findings of that census were that the unemployment rate for South Sea Islanders was around 28.5 per cent&mdash;about three times the national average; only about one-half of the South Sea Islanders who were working had been employed for all of the preceding year; more than 80 per cent of South Sea Islanders who had left school received less than the average weekly earning of around $500 a week; health within the group is poor, showing a lower average age of death than mainstream Australians; and, notably, the rate of diabetes was more than three times the Australian average. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Sea Islanders are an ethnic group which obviously warrants special assistance from the government. But the government has never had any programs to address the special problems of the descendants of the South Sea Islanders. While the South Sea Islanders have in the past had some access to government programs for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, this access has been actually denied to them in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I digress just briefly to speak again about the contribution of South Sea Islanders to my own community. As I mentioned previously, I am very proud of my own rural community. It is a very progressive rural community where so many Australians of different racial origin work together in harmony and for a common purpose. I was particularly proud that at the council elections held on 26 March this year Marlene Henaway, a South Sea Islander descendant who I earlier mentioned, won a position on the Burdekin Shire Council, a council that I was on for 11 years. It was tremendous to see Marlene elected and bringing her vision and energy to our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Marlene relates&mdash;our community knows all about it&mdash;a problem that my town of Ayr had with a crime wave by young black children. I regret to say that that problem was plastered across the pages of some of the tabloid newspapers in the south. But Marlene Henaway and her people did not ask the government to do anything and did not stand around blaming someone else. They got together, went out on the streets at night, rounded up these kids and dealt with them in their own way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not very long before what was a very serious problem in our community was completely obliterated. It was all done by the parents and relatives of the kids involved. Marlene Henaway was one of those who organised and took a major part in that. She deserves the congratulations of not only our community but also the whole of Australia. As I say, it was pleasing to see Councillor Henaway elected to our shire council at the last local authority election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an aside, I should also mention that Councillor Henaway is yet another Australian of non-Anglo-Saxon background who genuinely believes in the current Australian constitution, and she is prepared to say so publicly. She is also very proud of our flag, which, as she points out, has the sign of the cross on it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The campaign for recognition by the South Sea Islanders has been going on for some time. This campaign has been contributed to and enhanced very greatly by my colleague the honourable member for Dawson, Mr Ray Braithwaite, who, on a number of occasions in this parliament and in very many other ways, has raised the plight, the difficulties, the disadvantage and discrimination suffered by South Sea Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, seven Liberal senators who happened to be in Mackay as part of a fact-finding tour of North Queensland had the honour and opportunity of meeting with a group of South Sea Islanders to talk about this campaign for recognition of their race as a group within Australia and to ensure that the government responded to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission report, a response which would give recognition to Australian South Sea Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to the commission's report which is before the Senate today supports a number of recommendations and is the first step towards formal recognition of South Sea Islanders. The government has promised that the South Sea Islanders will be formally acknowledged as having their own history and culture in Australia. They will be acknowledged as an ethnic group, and the employment, education, health and housing needs of Australian South Sea Islanders will be taken into account by government agency programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The mainstream services which the group can currently access will be analysed to ensure that their needs are being met. This will involve liaising with the group as well as extensive gathering of data on the group. Australia's South Sea Islanders will be given an opportunity to work in government departments which deal directly with their communities, much in the same way that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can access employment positions relating to their people. As well, other educational and cultural provisions and community development assistance will be offered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite interesting that the government has seen this as the appropriate time to respond to this report, which was tabled on 15 December 1992. I understand that there has been an election in the intervening period, but it is a rather long wait for the government's response to this report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I think it would be inappropriate for this occasion to pass without making a number of observations in relation to South Sea Islanders, particularly in relation to the manner in which they have been treated&mdash;not just historically but also in recent times vis-a-vis the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community&mdash;under policy which has favoured one group of people over another for no good reason. I was saying to my coalition colleagues earlier this week that South Sea Islanders&mdash;Kanakas, as they were known, and many of them still call themselves Kanakas&mdash;are historically the most disadvantaged group of people in the country. They are perhaps even more disadvantaged than Aborigines for the simple reason that the Kanakas who were brought to this country were effectively brought as slaves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is convenient now in the 1990s for us to forget that this country has a history of slaving. Blackbirders were people who brought Kanakas principally to Queensland as slaves. `Blackbirder' was a polite term to describe a slaver.

This is a fact of which most Australians are totally ignorant, if they are willing to acknowledge it at all. I think it is appropriate for us to recognise that we have a slaving past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not say that this country should have a never ending guilt complex about it&mdash;because the South Sea Islanders whom I know would not support that point of view either; and I think Senator Burns would agree with me that they are very independent and proud people&mdash;but the country needs to recognise these things and then get on with ensuring that all Australians, irrespective of their racial background, have an equal opportunity to progress and give their families a decent standard of living. I think that is a point on which Senator Burns and I would be in agreement. It is, first of all, important to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to recognise that a lot of the prosperity which has been enjoyed in Queensland and elsewhere in Australia as a result of the contribution by the sugar industry was built on the backs&mdash;literally on the backs&mdash;of the Kanakas who were brought here from the South Sea Islands. It was their hard work that cleared the areas which are now used for cane; it was their labour that originally cleared those fields; it was their labour that planted and cut the cane; and it was their labour that enabled high standards of living to be enjoyed in those coastal areas of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When federation came and it was decided that it was inappropriate to continue to bring Kanakas into Australia, one of the trade-offs was an embargo on imported sugar. It was deemed inappropriate that sugar which was cut by white labour should have to compete with sugar that was cut with cheaper labour from overseas. That is the historical reason for the sugar embargo which remained in this country until 1989: it was deemed inappropriate for whites to have to work at the same rates as people who were South Sea Islanders or Asians from South-East Asia. Those were measures based on race, and they were the basis of the white Australia policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white Australia policy was originally aimed at two groups of people: the Kanakas, who were deported; and the Chinese, whose entry into this country was severely restricted. The mechanism by which the entry of Chinese into this country was restricted was through the language test and other measures associated with it which could be highly discriminatory. The two groups most discriminated against in terms of immigration policy in this country&mdash;the Kanakas and the Chinese&mdash;are the people who make the least noise about it. They say, `Look, it's in the past. Let's recognise it, but let's get on with the future'. That is a good sign for Australia. It is a good sign that in a multicultural country people can say, `Look, whatever happened in the past happened in the past, and now our objective should be in relation to the future.' The Kanakas and the Chinese deserve to be congratulated on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to add, however, that the report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission is deficient in one point. It quotes Mercer, on page 15, as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Chinese had been the object of restrictive immigration by the colonies in the 1880s, the Pacific Islanders were the only group to be deported. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is not quite correct because, of course, deportation measures were introduced by the Chifley government in 1948 in the Refugee Repatriation Bill. That was aimed at Asian wartime refugees who had served in the merchant marine of this country and whom the government of the day sought to deport at the end of the Second World War&mdash;and we are only talking about 800 people. But that government felt it appropriate to pass an act of parliament because one of the people whom they tried to deport successfully passed the language test and could not be deported under the white Australia policy. So that government felt it appropriate to pass a special act of parliament to deport Asian wartime refugees who had served this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that that sort of stuff went out with the days of the white Australian policy; in fact, it went out before then. On the election of the Menzies government at the end of the 1940s the wartime refugee bill was effectively done away with and the white Australia policy was abolished in 1967. But that is this country's past, and it is a past which has endured until recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the government's response to this report, I think it is good to see that the government is recognising there are particular disadvantages which are suffered by South Sea Islander groups. I refer to recommendation 5, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should make a specific allocation in the 1993-94 Budget&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it is getting a bit late&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for the provision of culturally appropriate programs for Australian South Sea Islanders and organisations (such as programs to include housing, legal, child care and financial services).</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad to see that because, when a South Sea Islander group approached me in 1992 to try to get a couple of thousand dollars assistance so its members could hold a conference in relation to housing and try to sort out for themselves problems relating to South Sea Islander or Kanaka housing in areas up and down the Queensland coast, I could not get the assistance from the government because it was unwilling to provide the money. There was no end of money for dubious causes for other groups, but it was very difficult to get money&mdash;just a couple of thousands dollars&mdash;for a group of Kanaka housing association representatives to get together to discuss their problems and try to find solutions to them. I am glad to see that the government has accepted that. I am also glad to see that the government accepts the fact that this group has suffered particular racial discrimination and that it says it is going to do something about the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation must be remedied. I am sure that if sensible programs are put together in the right way&mdash;programs that are designed to alleviate disadvantage, not to create a new form of advantage&mdash;those people, who are very proud Australians, will have equal opportunity to and will be able to succeed as equally as other Australians. These people have a history of being good Australians and they have a commitment to this country. I believe it is about time their contribution was recognised and their disadvantage was rectified.

These corporations end up wielding immense power without any real obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In abandoning national regulation of trade without developing international social and environmental regulation of trade, we set up the conditions where all nations become dependent on faceless international economic forces which have responsibility to their management and owners only.

Corporations feel it is their right to tell nations what to do in order to attract them. </PARA>

<PARA>Anybody knowing about international trade will know that this is not the only factor that must be in the acceptable range, but Vietnamese labour is already among the lowest paid in the world and Vietnam is not known for its environmental or workplace standards. What we have here is the equivalent of saying, `If you want us here, you dance to our tune.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So-called free trade can be a form of trade fascism. I have frequently mentioned that the Greens are in favour of seeing some breaks introduced at an international level to bring a measure of social and environmental accountability to the activities of transnational corporations. My concern is that, as in Vietnam, the push through GATT, APEC or AFTA, or through demands for structural adjustment by the IMF, World Bank and Asian Development Bank, will lead to a situation where nations are no longer able to bring to bear any effective social or environmental controls without damaging their economies. </PARA>

We will see more Indonesian and other labour activists gaoled for lengthy periods for daring to ask that minimum wage levels&mdash;$1.80 per day&mdash;be enforced.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Asian Development Bank, ADB, is in many respects a regional version of the World Bank. It includes five countries, mainly in East Asia, although it has European and North American donor members and includes some central Asian ex-USSR nations also covered by its sister bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank has traditionally concentrated on assistance through funding big infrastructure projects. Like the World Bank but a bit more slowly, the ADB is now starting to incorporate environmental and social objectives in its programs and to incorporate these as factors into its programs which are not primarily intended to achieve environmental and social ends. Like the World Bank, it is also an institution committed to a certain view of the role played in development by trade and financial deregulation and the proper role of government in the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While more informative than similar reports on the World Bank put out by Treasury, this report is still mainly descriptive in a way that tells very little. It describes functionally what the ADB is rather than what it is doing; the issues facing it, or Australia's position on these issues, what we are promoting and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia commits 25 per cent of its aid budget to multilateral organisations like the World Bank and the ADB. The proportion of such multilateral aid is increasing and so reporting on this is just as important as reporting on AIDAB. Reports should be at least as inclusive, especially since AIDAB is here and reasonably transparent. The ADB has headquarters in other countries, making information more difficult to access, and is generally unknown and relatively unseen compared with AIDAB and the World Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The annual report to parliament should include some breakdown of the projects being funded and to what extent, what their current status is, which projects have been reviewed and what the reviews showed. I would also like a clear outline of major policy issues dealt with by the bank and Australia's position in the negotiations. If these organisations are to be major recipients of aid money, there must be more accountability and transparency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is beginning to improve its position, the Asian Development Bank suffers many of the same problems as the World Bank. These include a heavy weighting toward big infrastructure projects&mdash;dams, electricity projects, roads, et cetera. As with the World Bank, there are criticisms about the appropriateness of these projects and their social and environmental impacts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While there are now some programs intended to address these issues directly, the aid record is full of inappropriate and poorly designed projects, including environmental and social projects. While employing a few people to assess the social and environmental impacts of projects, the big multilateral banks and agencies have not always been very good at listening to them. Projects also tend to continue leaving out people, and do not incorporate community self-determination or community control of projects very well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue I raise briefly is that of the increasing tendency to promote the profits to be made from aid. The report notes that we have made far more from support of the bank than we have contributed to it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We made this money from goods sold to the bank through its procurement programs.</PARA>
<PARA>The `we' is used loosely in this case&mdash;the `we' who fund the bank being the government while the `we' who make the money through procurement is private industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this emphasis on the benefits of aid is increasingly being found elsewhere in relation to other aid programs, such as the recent `A profit in our country' seminar at Parliament House on the economic benefits of our agricultural research aid. That was said to generate profits here at roughly double the rate of assistance. This is sometimes promoted as the win-win model of aid. While I understand that this is partially a means of promoting aid in the face of those who would cut any expenditure that does not generate profit, it is a trend that disturbs me. It does so because where the assistance programs begin to be evaluated on the basis of how much profit they return, the whole notion of assistance becomes distorted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no problems with the idea in principle of `win-win' aid, but I know that where aid dollars are short and the need is great, programs that do not generate an obvious benefit for the donor may miss out. They are not `win-lose' programs; they are simply real assistance. One of the things that concerns me especially is that what I would call real assistance&mdash;assistance to communities in genuine hardship that work with the communities to generate the capacity to sustainably improve their lives&mdash;are those which are least likely to generate a profit in the donor country. They are nonetheless the projects which will give the greatest assistance in the most equitable and least domineering way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I would like to raise at greater length is that of bank support of structural readjustment policies in line with those of the World Bank and the IMF. This is not explicitly stated anywhere, but comments about bank assistance to improve the domestic and economic policy environment of recipient nations is basically jargon for the structural readjustment push. Structural adjustment in this context basically means opening economies to imports and foreign investment and reducing government domestic economic controls to foster the private sector. (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension of time granted</EMPHASIS>) It usually means that pressure is applied for fiscal management, meaning cutbacks to social, education and health programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the ASEAN nations have been growing fast enough that the impact is not so obvious, the Asian Development Bank is not only concerned with ASEAN, but includes Bangladesh, Pacific island states and so on. Structural adjustment programs can have devastating effects. In many of these countries such policies work counter to attempts to promote equity. The rapid shift away from traditional agriculture to a more mechanised agriculture with greater concentration of land ownership has seen millions of people shifted from a hard life in the country on small farms to a life in the squalor of urban shanty towns. The push for rapid modernisation in company with free market development has meant that the inherent inequities in many traditional societies are translated into massive inequalities in wealth and access to resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely immoral for the ADB, the World Bank or Australia, within these agencies or outside them, to push for structural readjustment which would act directly against the interests of people in these nations. Thailand is a nation with a relatively good outcome, arguably because of its success in population control. Yet the problems are still rife there. Indonesia, the Philippines and other nations have even greater problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I strongly urge that Australia stop pushing for structural readjustment type programs in other nations and international forums and that it actively promote instead a policy of development where equity and general wellbeing have precedence over pushing for free market development that helps mainly national elites and trans-national corporations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note that the annual report to the parliament on the Asian Development Bank makes reference to the need to address gender issues and to pursue an integrated approach in bringing women into the mainstream of development activity.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No less than structural reform is required to break down institutional barriers which women face because of their gender; that is, inadequate legal protection of their rights, discrimination in employment, unequal pay, denigrating portrayals in the media, low levels of political representation, violence against them by men, no rights to credit or land in their own right&mdash;to name but a few. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Structural courses of women's poverty must be addressed at the same time as providing for their practical needs. Whilst more women may become beneficiaries of development projects, the real causes of their impoverishment will not have been removed. Implementation of the suggestions in the report, with their emphasis on promoting unrestricted play of market economics and fiscal restraint, will adversely affect the very women's programs that the report advocates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because funding bodies are run by men who do not easily know or take account of the needs of women, there is an inherent contradiction between the recommendations to increase the role of women into the mainstream of development activities and the recommendations that emphasise and promote economic progress from an economic fundamentalist perspective. In order to be heard in development decisions, development programs must promote and assist the ability of women to organise to support each other and to challenge the inequities they perceive. Women must be able to meet freely together, without fear, to talk about what is important in their lives and what they want changed. Economics seems to have become the quasi-science which drives development. Yet it is seriously flawed where women are concerned, if not in all other areas. What is called development in fact often deprives the poorest in a society of even the most basic needs and rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the name of economic efficiency, many of the costs of services previously borne by the public sector have been shifted to the private realm. In many instances this means they have been shifted to women, already overworked and exhausted. Greater production levels mean more work for already overloaded women. But economists make false assumptions about the availability of women's labour because their own statistics fail to recognise what women are already doing. If women's labour does not pass through the market, it does not exist in the model world of the economist. Until economics as a discipline writes non-market production into the equation, these problems will persist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same theories which fail to take into account subsistence and much of the informal economy also fail to account for the losses incurred through environmental destruction. Yet women, as agriculturalists, gatherers of wood and providers of water know only too well the threat of environmental damage. At the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in June 1992, women lobbied effectively for recognition of their role as environmental managers and for greater decision making roles in environment and development matters. But the major economic institutions which shape development policies are still controlled by men and operate on gender biased theories. Many aid programs seem to give assistance to men as the head of families, not understanding the effect they have on societies where work is divided along gender lines. Emphasis on free market solutions also works to reinforce the divisions in society that see women with less access to the formal economy but a greater part of the real economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is serious about women's development, it has to get behind these grass-roots efforts. Equally, it must support women with the skills and access to lobby effectively for legal and institutional change and a shift in global, national and local resource allocation in favour of women. They must also ensure that in promoting other more general programs they are not having unintended consequences on women and equity generally. The assumption that improvement in the general economic figures automatically translates into better lives for all members of society, and specifically for women, often proves faulty in practice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the Senate's attention to a number of aspects in respect of Auditor-General's report No.1 of 1994-95. Among other things, the report notes that the CSIRO retains all its externally generated income without any decrease in appropriation allocations. We know that for this triennium CSIRO funding has been cut by $80 million compared with where it would have been in 1983 had funds not been cut. So that statement clearly is an untrue statement. What seems to be happening is that, as CSIRO is attracting more external funding, its appropriations are being cut. It is a sleight of hand to claim that the appropriations are not being interfered with by the degree to which CSIRO attracts outside funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main issues I want to raise relate to how the demand on the CSIRO and other research institutes to get 30 per cent or more of their funding from external sources has totally distorted the research work. One eventually finishes up with the situation identified by the Auditor-General in which the appropriation is used as a subsidy for work which is essentially being done for private interests. For instance, the Auditor-General, amongst other things, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are no specific measurements of the costs to the Organisation of external funding, either in terms of developing proposals or in supporting projects. It could be that as much as 70-80% of total resources is used to support externally funded projects which contribute only 30-40% of total funding.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that some of the CSIRO divisions are pushing to get as  much as 70 per cent of their funding from external sources. This quite clearly means that the proportion which is appropriation funding is simply the subsidy which underpins the work which is now being totally done for private interests. CSIRO then becomes the handmaiden of private interests&mdash;doing the research work which private companies should be doing, but doing it to a large degree at public expense. Among other things, the report also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Organisation does not record the costs of preparing proposals and it is unable to specify them in its pricing structure.</PARA>
<PARA>This is another indication that CSIRO itself has little idea of the extent to which its appropriation funding is underpinning the work which it does for private companies and private organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect to this is the way in which the research becomes distorted by that requirement for external funding. The Auditor-General talks about the setting of priorities and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of Divisions do not apply for, or accept, some grants and refuse consultancy work in those cases where the price is judged not to cover full costs, especially when projects are not research priorities.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, without an adequate costing framework it is difficult to know how much externally funded projects are subsidised by appropriations, or the extent to which  appropriations subsidise projects for which infrastructure costs are not recovered from the funding body.</PARA>
<PARA>Of the various institutes, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . six Institutes did not have a strategic plan, although two of the Institutes had rolling five-year plans. Similarly, some Divisions had no strategic plan . . .</PARA>
<PARA>This indicates that these divisions are being driven by the need to attract this external funding; that they are being driven by short-term concerns and therefore have no long-term strategy plans. The Auditor-General specifically goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basis of the CSIRO strategic plan is a set of research priorities which influence expenditure allocation decisions. They were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">. . . established on the basis of the anticipated returns to Australia derived from comprehensive assessments of the attractiveness and feasibility of conducting research directed to identified socio-economic objectives.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA>But then he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite setting research priorities via the accepted process at the corporate level, Divisions were not following suit, with the potential result that some research carried out is of low priority or does not fall within the corporately chosen priority research areas. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This clearly identifies that, again, some of CSIRO's work is not being identified by the process that the Executive Director of CSIRO has said it is and which, through reports to the parliament, CSIRO has maintained is the process by which it sets its priorities. It looks at the feasibility and desirability of doing this work. It is then supposed to select from the two-dimensional graph those projects which are highest in the two-dimensional space and then go out and seek funding for those projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is clearly happening in some cases, and what the Auditor-General has identified, is that, rather than proceeding in that way, the funding is calling the tune and the research is then being directed towards those projects which return a profit. These two things, to which the Auditor-General has drawn our attention, are a cause for very considerable concern in the CSIRO. To a degree, they should also be of concern to the general and scientific policy of this country because they infect our universities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly in support of the remarks made by Senator Coulter. It is indeed of concern when we see reports such as Auditor-General's report No.1 of 1994-95. The Auditor-General may be in a somewhat difficult position in as much as we are critical of the philosophical approach and the impact of a policy which requires the CSIRO to seek a greater percentage of private funding. I suppose I should put the word `private' in inverted commas because in reality, as I have said on other occasions, it is not private funding at all; companies that get the CSIRO to do their research receive something like a 160 per cent tax deduction. So this research is largely funded from the public purse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Coulter suggested, funding and research are being pushed into areas that are considered useful by industry and perhaps the CSIRO is moving further and further away from pure research. This has negative spin-offs even in terms of possible scientific development and industry benefits in the future because many of the discoveries which are useful for the environment or for industry come about through pure research, not in specific areas that industry may be pushing for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing aspects of recent developments in the CSIRO, in relation to the promotion of corporatism, has been a greater level of genetic engineering. This development has become so much a part of the CSIRO ethic that in recent times we have seen public promotions of CSIRO work, press releases and so on that are specifically geared to talk about the latest effort in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This has become so much of a problem that the report, under the heading `Key Points', states that `management of intellectual property needs improving.' That means that under the GATT there are some real problems. There is so much development in genetic engineering and the patenting of new species, I presume, by corporations which have conducted the research that we have a real problem as to who owns that intellectual property, how that can be best maintained and who gets the benefits of that intellectual property in the future. In relation to intellectual property, I know of people involved in ecological research who find that the ability to freely share information between scientists at the international level has been very much cut back in recent times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody is concerned about intellectual property. We are all losers when international scientists feel very much restricted about sharing, publishing and sending information about their ideas and developing ideas to people in the informal network. What we see in section 12 of this report is merely a symptom of what will continue to happen with ownership of intellectual property, considering that we have gone in the wrong direction when it comes to research and our priorities in research. Madam Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>I would like to make a couple of points very clear at the outset. This motion is aimed at those people who are suffering what has been described to us as the worst drought in living memory, or the worst drought in Australia's history, and its impact on agricultural areas. This motion is targeted at those areas; it is not targeted at everybody in the community, and I wish to make that absolutely crystal clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In dealing with part (a) of the motion I will talk about the things I have highlighted and also the distribution effects of those policies. I will deal with that in more detail in a moment or two. On the matter of income equalisation deposits, everyone in this parliament supports farmers and pastoralists becoming self-reliant, but to become self-reliant they must have the conditions, the circumstances and the policies in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992, the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs produced a report in relation to the impact of drought in Australia. That report dealt with the ongoing seasonal situation which occurs in Australia from time to time. What we are looking at now is something beyond what the committee could assess in 1992. Maybe there is a case for the committee going out and having a look at some of those areas to see what has occurred since 1992 because many of the areas we went to have been in constant drought since then. This has exacerbated the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say categorically that this government did not give farmers an opportunity to become self-reliant during the 1980s. I say that for a number of reasons, one of which is the high interest regime. I will not deal with that matter today, other than to mention that it existed, and it existed for everybody. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to deal with income equalisation deposits, and I will quote from what Mr Howard said in the other place in the debate in 1984. It is constructive when looking at this matter to see how people in the bush have not had the opportunity to become self-reliant. At the time Mr Howard was speaking the IED scheme had been changed from what existed between 1976 and 1984. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our concern is that the changes that have been made by the Government and which are proposed to be implemented by this legislation have the effect of virtually destroying the income equalisation deposits scheme as a useful aid to Australia's primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to move an amendment that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">`the Bill be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) deposits to be deductible in full;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) interest to be payable on the investment component only of deposits where the investment component is equal to the balance of the deposit as if tax had been payable in the year of deposit at the rate applicable to a producer's average income; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3) interest to be payable at the rate of 9.5 per cent per annum.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the Opposition believe that if the income equalisation deposit scheme were changed along those lines it would regain its attractiveness to primary producers but, at the same time, it would not provide avenues for unfair exploitation and avenues that confer unfair advantages on primary producers.</PARA>
<PARA>I reassert that those words are as true today as they were then. One of the problems with the exacerbation of the current situation is that from 1984 to 1990 many farmers in this country had high incomes&mdash;particularly in the wool industry&mdash;but they did not have the opportunity to set aside what has been called a `haystack of money'. Had the government taken that advice at that time we would not have had the situation that we have today. It is inexcusable that the government did not take heed of that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal now with fuel excise. Since 1983 fuel excise has risen from 7c to 32c. The government might say that that is fine because everybody pays it, and that is true. However, the problem is distribution. The further people live from the centre of activity and action the more it hits us and the harder it becomes. It hits rural people significantly harder than people who live in our capital cities. It affects the price of bread and milk. It affects the price of shifting livestock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Transport operators have told me that the fuel excise constitutes between 10 and 20 per cent of their operating costs&mdash;the longer the haul, the greater the cost. One operator in the Northern Territory estimated that the cost of the fuel excise to him in his operation was 23 per cent of the total cost of carrying cattle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to refer to is the expansion of the sales tax base. Someone may stand up on the other side and say, `But farmers are exempt'. That is quite true if they get a sales tax exemption number. But that is not the problem. The problem lies with the contractors and the impact it has on their operating costs. The distribution effects are similar to those encountered with the fuel excise. It hits harder the further people live from the centre of action. It affects livestock transporters, fencing contractors, water and windmill contractors, water carriers, and fodder carriers&mdash;all the services people utilise and rely on when there is a serious drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give one example. A four-decker stock crate costs $85,000. The sales tax on that is $17,850. That militates against destocking, which has a consequent environmental impact. Milk-tanker owners do not pay sales tax on their trucks. I argue that the stock carriers should be given exactly the conditions as the milk-tanker operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly make a couple of comments on the question of `severe drought'&mdash;and no doubt the report that we had today will be quoted back at me. I think I could say quite categorically on behalf of all members on the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs that, firstly, it was a very difficult question and, secondly, we did not and could not come up with a proposition which would deal with this particular aspect. We wrestled with it. There is no scientific answer; there are no guides which can be used conclusively. The effect of rain distribution, wind, temperature and all of those things make it virtually impossible. But there comes a time when people have to make a decision, and that decision has to be made by using one's eyes, ears and brain. I believe we have reached that situation, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales in so far as this drought is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with the calls on the government with regard to the fodder subsidy scheme. I believe we have reached a point where the government needs to step in for the sake of holding what breeding stock is left in the cattle and sheep industries. It can be done in such a way that it does not distort the market. Once again, I know it will be claimed that it will distort the market, but the evidence does not support that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not believe it does. If we look at the prices and the impact, we see that the situation is not very different from that of the 1980s. But there are mechanisms to get around that problem, particularly when people have to start moving grain interstate. When people have to start moving grain interstate and they are buying feed grain from the grain pool of Western Australia, the grain handling authorities in South Australia or the Wheat Board, the price is set by the export market price. That is the basis it is sold from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many ways in which assistance can be given to moving grain. We have to separate this from freight subsidies in the stricter sense because freight subsidies have always been associated with the movement of stock. So it can be utilised there in terms of freight. It can be brought into an area, put in central points and sold at a particular price, and it can be targeted to those people who are in the drought affected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last point relates to the assets test. We call on the government to suspend the assets test on people in drought affected areas for Austudy and the various forms of support they receive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making that point here. The assets test should be suspended for those in drought affected areas and I made those points at the start of my speech. Even though their assets might be above the upper limit, these people are running into the problem that, because they have no income and they are in a situation where they cannot sell the back paddock, they are unable to borrow any more money. It does not matter whether their debt on top of that is $100,000 or $500,000, no financial institution will lend finance to anybody who cannot service that debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the point is that this is targeted at drought areas, particularly those severe drought areas which have been identified in Queensland and New South Wales. It is not targeted in the broad sense.

I was not going to bother to do this separately but, because this debate was brought on this afternoon, I will do it now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday in the Senate, Senator Boswell, in very dramatic terms, called on me to be a man and apologise to Mr Anderson and so on. He gave an extraordinary version of Mr Anderson's press conference on the question of propositions that a government, presumably a coalition government, would involve itself in facilitating the removal of significant portions of farmers' debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make this clear. I have enormous respect for Senator Boswell's integrity. I do not accuse Senator Boswell of deliberately misleading the Senate, but I say to him that he has been very sadly dealt with by his colleague in the explanation he gave the Senate yesterday. Mr Anderson or his staff have been caught out on this by that same little piece of machinery that caught out his leader in the Northern Territory when he tried to mislead people; that is, a tape-recorder. The press conference was tape-recorded. I am happy to provide Senator Boswell with a tape. I have a verbatim transcript of it, and I will table the transcript. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt for one second that Senator Boswell was simply relying on advice given to him by others when he came into the chamber yesterday. I relied on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> article, which was absolutely accurate, when we compare it with the transcript. Senator Boswell said in here yesterday, and he will recall it, that Mr Anderson had not actually proposed this suggestion as one of his but was simply responding to questions from journalists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a verbatim transcript of the press conference. Mr Anderson, in his opening statement to the conference, before a single question was asked, talked about setting up a committee. The drought committee that the coalition is to establish does not, I note, include the Leader of the National Party in the Senate. It does not have Senator Boswell on it. I think that might have more to do with the fact that Senator Boswell has been the frontrunner on this issue and he has, without question, received more press on this issue than the shadow minister himself. I think that has more to do with his being kept off that committee than anything else. That is just my view; he would know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about the setting up the committee in his opening statement, Mr Anderson said that this would be one of the things the committee would examine. He said:</PARA>

<PARA>I do not know who from Mr Anderson's office misled Senator Boswell yesterday. It was not in response to a question from any journalist.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second piece of dodging and weaving that has been engaged in by the members of the opposition, who were obviously in some confusion and disarray on this matter, is from Senator Panizza. I was astonished at his personal explanation today when he accused the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of getting it wrong. We have already had Mr Anderson accusing newspapers of getting it wrong. Senator Panizza accused the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of getting it wrong by personal explanation because the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> had said that he had attacked the fodder subsidy proposal that we are supporting in here today. He objected to it and disagreed with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier today I watched the monitor of Senator Panizza, who stood up here today and said that the only thing he had criticised in here yesterday was me, the minister.

<PARA>Senator Panizza said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, it has got some problems. I argued against it yesterday because I believe it should go on to freight instead.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So do I.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I have to say that I do not quite know what the opposition is up to on this issue of drought. But, once again, the opposition really does need to get its act together. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> got it right and Senator Panizza's explanation today was in total conflict with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record of yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having corrected those two items I want to return to the debate and the matters specifically raised by Senator Crane's motion, the IEDs, fuel excise and the fodder subsidy scheme, which, as Senator Panizza told the Senate yesterday correctly, does have some big problems. That is why when the government conducted a major review&mdash;the first time it had ever happened, actually&mdash;into drought and setting up a national drought policy in 1990, it was specifically recommended against by the task force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who was on the task force? Representatives of the Commonwealth government, state departments and the peak industry bodies in Australia, the cattle council, the National Farmers Federation and the Grains Council of Australia. They came down against things like fodder subsidies. I want to explain that because, remarkably, before John Kerin initiated this we did not have a national drought policy for Australia. And I am sure Senator Crane would agree with me by saying that was, as the report notes, an astonishing thing in a country like ours where&mdash;and Senator Crane acknowledged it again in the debate today and the report says this, correctly&mdash;drought is a feature of the Australian landscape. I quote from the first volume of the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It comes as a surprise that Australia, one of the driest continents on the globe, does not have a national drought policy. More surprising perhaps is that until recently executive responsibility for drought at federal level did not rest with the agricultural portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reference to where we now want to be taken, although I concede that that is not part of this motion&mdash;back to simply lumping it in with the national disaster relief arrangements administered by the finance ministers, not by agriculture ministers in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nobody whom I spoke to on the ground in Queensland, from farmers to representatives of the peak bodies, wanted to support that. I put it on the table and said, `Do you think it is a reasonable idea'&mdash;because I had an open mind on it&mdash;and they said `No, we don't want it to go back to that at all.' So everyone that I have talked to has rejected that in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These documents make very instructive reading because they led to this document, the Senate committee's investigation of this issue in 1992. It is totally consistent and is why we have this drought policy today. The specific recommendation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Managing for drought</EMPHASIS> contained in this first ever major examination of the question of drought in Australia&mdash;and that is why I think it should be paid some regard&mdash;was that things like fodder subsidy should not be supported and government assistance should be directed through RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will hear arguments&mdash;and I will, in fact I welcome them, I call for them; I have been doing it for weeks&mdash;on helpful suggestions as to how we can restructure RAS. And let me tell Senator Boswell that I have noted and given an undertaking, which I am discharging, that I will examine all of the concerns that he and others have raised about RAS&mdash;in fact I am doing it. Senator Boswell would have noted that I acted immediately to correct what was clearly a problem that I identified myself some months ago in New South Wales RAS by amending those guidelines and opening up the system for further claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is laid out, I have to say, very persuasively in this major examination not just by experts. CSIRO was represented on the task force, as well as industry. The unanimous decision was that they did not want to go back to things like fodder subsidies. They wanted drought dealt with specifically through a rural adjustment scheme. What objections did they have against fodder subsidies? I know from my own experience on the land, even though it is years ago, the truth of some of the conclusions they came to. First of all&mdash;and there can be an argument about how much it distorts the market&mdash;there is a straight up and down economic argument, which cannot be argued, that subsidies of any kind distort the market; they do. But that is not the major issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issue&mdash;and I know it is a major concern for Senator Panizza, and he probably said it in his party room&mdash;is that it is a positive disincentive for farmers to plan for drought. I know that is the view of many members of the coalition; it is certainly the view on the ground in the bush. It is a positive disincentive not to plan for drought. In other words, it totally destroys the rationale of the recommendations for the national drought policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put this to the coalition very sincerely indeed: I would be a little reluctant, without the most scrupulous examination&mdash;and I will continue looking at it&mdash;to totally dismantle the major centrepiece of the first drought policy this country has ever had, which was endorsed completely by the Senate committee on which Senator Crane serves and on which Senator Brownhill was the deputy chair, without a dissenting voice, endorsed by the Senate in 1992, that we should direct all our government assistance at assisting farmers to plan for drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell will find that in these reports&mdash;he should read them because they are instructive. The fodder subsidies&mdash;not freight, which of course state governments are already providing assistance with&mdash;are a total disincentive for proper management for farmers. I know that is the view of many of the farmers who were sitting opposite me this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coalition members might have heard the chief of the CSIRO division of ecology&mdash;the division I used to work for&mdash;on the ABC this morning denouncing the proposal, and I do not blame him because there is another problem: fodder subsidies encourage bad managers to retain overstocking on land for much longer than they should have the stock carried on that land, which leads to massive land degradation and loss of top soil. It is an appalling proposition from an economic perspective, from a planning and management of farm perspective, which is the centrepiece of the national drought plan, not devised by the government but put together by the first, only and most exhaustive examination of the problem of drought ever conducted in this country that comprised the peak level involvement of all of the major primary industry groups in Australia as well as state and federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This afternoon the coalition is asking me to vote in favour of a proposition that would utterly dismantle the first drought policy the country has ever had, which was reconfirmed by a Senate committee only as late as 1992. I have to say that this afternoon I am not about to do that because the problems I have raised about transaction based subsidies, which is how they are referred to in these documents, are real. Having said that, I repeat what I said in the Senate yesterday: the situation with drought is now affecting all Australians, not just rural Australians. The drought is continuing to deepen and worsen in Queensland and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a meeting this morning here with my colleague the South Australian minister for agriculture. Parts of Western Australia, of course, are now drought affected as well. The central parts of the Northern Territory are now drought affected. Unfortunately, the advice from the Bureau of Meteorology is grim and discouraging; the situation will not quickly get better. I have given a commitment publicly and in this Senate that we are continuing to examine the issue. I will take a further submission back to cabinet in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went straight to cabinet, as I committed myself to do, and got immediate additional assistance. And I want to put that in perspective. People are saying, `Only $14 million conscience money.' It has to be seen in the perspective that it took the total amount of money we have given in specific drought assistance to over $50 million. It was not meant to be seen as anything other than an immediate response. I am examining these other issues that Senator Crane has canvassed in here&mdash;the IED scheme and all the rest of it&mdash;as I said I would, and I am continuing to do what is extremely important. It is something, regrettably, that the coalition did not do, as has now been publicly revealed in its promulgation of this drought policy yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am continuing to work closely with the state governments of Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia now and Victoria&mdash;indeed, all of my state and territory colleagues&mdash;to discuss with them the best ways of a coordinated approach, state and federal, to deal with the drought and, importantly, the industry that we are trying to help. That is why the coalition's policy is in as much trouble as it is in now and being attacked&mdash;because Mr Anderson did not bother consulting with anybody. He did not talk to any of the industry groups. The NFF has already made the point that it would like to be consulted. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is now excluding people from getting social welfare benefits because of an assets test, and it is excluding them from sending their children for a tertiary education.

It is at least 1,000, possibly 2,000, kids that are sitting on their properties at home helping their fathers mend the fences, driving the cars or just vegetating at home because they cannot afford the $6,000 to $8,000 to go to tertiary education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at a few other things. At the moment, the government has a plan for 1,200 people to go on farm household support.

Once people get their feet on that sticky paper, they have to pay it back after the end of nine months or they have to exit the property. The government's own policies are not biting. The government's plan for `exceptional circumstances' on wool was to pick up 16,000 people. In fact, 1,953 people accessed `exceptional circumstances' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us see what we have left. The government put $42.2 million into wool `exceptional circumstances', but spent $15 million. In the worst crisis in rural history, produced by an excess of interest rates, a drought, and a collapse of the commodity price when wool was down to 360c a kilo, the government's return of $27 million out of the wool `exceptional circumstances' did not hit home.

It makes out that some people&mdash;apart from those in the opposition&mdash;do not understand those problems and do not have the view that others should be helped in those circumstances. The motion clearly talks about the question of the severe drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion is that an opportunity should be given for the fuel excise to no longer be levied on people in drought circumstances. Of course, we have to be fair and equitable for all people in the community. We cannot reduce that excise for people on farms unless it is done for people generally in the community. But that does not mean that they cannot be assisted in another way, whether that is by money coming from the government or by other outlays which can be applied to assist people in areas where there is severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As everybody knows, the fuel excise collection is not applied as income but only to the area of roads. Other outlays involve other social programs that the government carries out&mdash;programs that benefit people in rural areas as well as those in cities and provincial towns. It would be too messy to apply Senator Crane's motion that the fuel excise not be levied on country people. Senator Crane talked about fodder subsidy. I think the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) has quite clearly put our position. It is interesting to look at a short article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS>. The article said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The farming industry yesterday rejected the coalition's drought policy as incomplete and insubstantial. National Farmers Federation policy director Gary Goucher said the centrepiece of the coalition's policy, a subsidy for fodder, was riddled with problems. He said there was a range of unexplained areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not know whether Senator Crane's motion is supposed to explain some of those areas, but it does not do it very well. The suggestion of the fodder subsidy is certainly not a goer. There is mention of equalisation of income in terms of bank deposits. I was chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs in 1992, which Senator Collins talks about. We wrote a letter to Treasury about the position of IEDs. We said that there were a number of ways that we felt they could be improved. We talked about the importance of certain provisions being there. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter dated 3 July 1992 concerning suggestions you have received for the Income Equalisation (IED) scheme that might serve to make the scheme more "attractive" to primary producers. The suggestions for the scheme were as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">fully tax linked;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.deposits should be fully deductible in the year of deposit;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.interest should be accrued at the short term bond rate; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the principal and accrued income be fully assessable at the individual's marginal tax rate in the year of withdrawal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that you are correct in your understanding that these are all features of the current IED scheme introduced in 1989.</PARA>
<PARA>The scheme was introduced as a result of an action by the government. I think it is interesting to note that nobody on that committee suggested otherwise. Everybody was concerned to make sure that we maintained a viable rural industry which contained many family enterprises&mdash;that is, the family farm. We suggested that it should be introduced in an effective way. In 1992 the government's response to the committee's suggestion that there should be an effective IED scheme was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Changes to the Income Equalisation Deposit (IED) Scheme, including the implementation of a new Farm Management Bond were implemented by amending the relevant legislation in December 1992. The adjustments to the IED Scheme were aimed at improving its operation and making it more attractive so as to encourage greater self-reliance during downturns. In particular, Farm Management Bonds are a more concessional tranche within the overall IED Scheme, expressly designed as a provision against hardship arising from natural events such as drought.</PARA>
<PARA>The information I have just placed on the record indicates nothing but the fact that the government is concerned about the people in the rural areas, and it has provided provisions for them to have what is called a money stack. Some people may think the government could be even more concessional&mdash;it could help even more&mdash;and they are entitled to have that opinion, but the government has another opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can look at how the rural industry has responded to the IEDs in the various ways in which they have applied and the conditions under which they have applied. In 1975-76&mdash;just after a Labor government was thrown out&mdash;the amount applying was $3,000. By 1982-83&mdash;just prior to the election of a Labor government&mdash;it was up to $154,030,000. Through the years, it went down and it went up. The figure in 1992-93 was $109 million; 1993-94, $137 million; and 1994-95&mdash;when the drought had been going for some time&mdash;$129,034,000 up to mid-August. These figures came from the levies management unit of the department of primary industries. It does indicate that people saw the IEDs as being attractive and certainly did use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Minister Collins has already indicated, everybody has come to the conclusion that one must plan self-sufficiency to take care of drought. I do not think anybody with any knowledge of the rural industry and this country would try to suggest that there are not droughts that are so severe that people cannot manage for them. They deserve, and should be given, assistance by the general community. That is recognised by the fact that many people in the cities are now making individual donations, and certain banks and other companies are assisting in raising finance to assist people in bad circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one goes back many years, there was a fellow named Tyson who had a network of stations. He said that he was going to have an empire which was drought-proof, because all of his large stations would not be in drought at the same time and he could move stock from one station to the other. He came a bit of a cropper, too, because the drought was so widespread that even he bit the dust on that particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the individual problems that people have, one cannot blame it all on the drought. Some people have been in drought for some time. They have quite consciously understocked over the years and are still in bad circumstances&mdash;of that there is no doubt. But there are others who have overstocked and found themselves in difficult circumstances. There are others who, through bad advice from banks, have taken out loans that have put them in the position where their farms have been sold up and they have lost everything, which is a very sad situation. But just because a place is in drought, everybody is not in the same bad circumstances, although I very clearly say that most people would be in very difficult circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are issues in relation to education, social benefits and the assets test. Surely this is not something which is raised in terms of a drought situation. This is something which has to be looked at in normal circumstances&mdash;whether people should qualify and the terms of the scheme so that people can qualify. Some people from the country have made comparisons and given evidence to the current inquiry into the rural adjustment scheme. They raised the issue as to why they should not get some help as far as Austudy is concerned; they are denied that right because of their assets. Other people can have a $2 million house at the Gold Coast, in Sydney at Vaucluse or somewhere else and they are able to get Austudy. I find that unfair. I very clearly state my personal opinion that anyone with a $2 million house should not get Austudy either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the facts are that over time the government has been very concerned about people affected by drought. We have introduced a number of schemes, some of which I have talked about, and I believe they have been very helpful indeed. We will continue to look at the problem, as the minister has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain of one thing: no government of any colour will ever be able to introduce a scheme that will make everybody happy. Some people are very reasonable in their approach. They do things for themselves. They become self-sufficient. They do everything right so that they are in the best position they can be when a severe drought comes along, and therefore they do not need as much help as other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that the opposition's proposition is some cheap political effort to point score when people are in very dire circumstances in the rural areas. That is something which is recognised by everybody. Again, I say that the government is considering that as a very important and priority issue and it will do whatever it can to help. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, wish to speak in this debate and support the motion that the suffering and hardship of people in severely drought affected areas has been exacerbated by policies decisions made by Labor governments during the 1980s. I remind Senator Burns that we are not talking in this debate about the government introducing schemes to make people happy, as he puts it. We are talking about making the existing system work better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of the paragraphs that Senator Crane has used in this motion contain measures that already exist. The coalition sees that these measures could work better&mdash;particularly the IED scheme, the fuel excise scheme, the sales tax scheme, the assets test and the income test. Those systems that are in place should work better. We are not talking about some magical system that should be suddenly introduced by government to make people happy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has already added to the attitude of the present government by referring to drought as just a normal occurrence in rural life. Those of us who live in the country know that drought is a part of rural life, but this particular drought is not. There are people in northern New South Wales and Queensland who have been having negative incomes for the last four or five years. I put to the government that that is not a normal occurrence in rural life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition drought policy announced earlier this week by John Anderson favours the suspension of the assets test. We are not talking about waiving the assets test altogether. We are talking about suspending it so that those people who are particularly affected by the hardships of this drought have an opportunity to gain access to existing government support schemes and use them for the continuance of their farm life and the continuance of their family life. It would not be appropriate to abolish the assets test altogether, as farmers should not be seen, and would not wish to be seen, as being in a privileged position vis-a-vis the rest of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in this economic climate it is unfortunate that an increasing number of farmers are being forced to apply for government assistance. Most farmers are currently ineligible for social welfare payments because their properties put them outside the assets ceiling. The government simply does not seem to comprehend the fact that possession or ownership of broadacres does not necessarily mean that an income is derived from that. Ironically, the more fortunate ones in the short term are those whose debts&mdash;often massive&mdash;pull them beneath the ceiling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entire families are being hurt by this drought. The very high unemployment rates inflicted on Australians by this Labor government mean that families are trying to keep their children at school longer because, first, they cannot afford to employ them on the farm and, secondly, they know that if they send them out into the labour market they will not be able to get a job. The problem for farm families is that they cannot afford to keep them in school or at tertiary education either. The assets test for Austudy means that many farm families are ineligible for aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some families say that they would not be suffering so much if drought were the only problem to contend with. They are still suffering from the high interest rates of the 1980s and the early 1990s, low commodity prices, a substantially weaker financial position and escalating fuel taxes. Indeed, in the last four years equity has slipped for many farm families from 100 per cent equity in their farm property to closer to 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wish to comment on the income equalisation deposit scheme. The present structure of IEDs is another example of the government's inability to comprehend the fluctuating nature of farm income. IEDs must be made more attractive to farmers, from both an interest bearing point of view and a taxation point of view. They should encourage farmers to put aside income from good years to be used during lean years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation policy document has commented that the current structure of IEDs makes them attractive principally to high income farmers&mdash;obviously, not applicable in today's economic climate, as this is the fifth consecutive year of negative income for farmers. Even in years of reasonable income, research has shown that IEDs are not an attractive investment option for many farmers. If IEDs were attractive, people would obviously use them, but they do not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of IEDs by government does not constitute special treatment for farmers. Wage and salary earners benefit from generous tax concessions for superannuation as a means of stabilising income over their life cycle and they do not suffer the tax penalty from fluctuating income. For farmers, this requirement is even more pressing, since low or negative income years occur from time to time throughout their working life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The withholding tax which applies at the time of withdrawal is discriminatory as no similar tax applies to other investments. It particularly penalises farmers who are withdrawing funds because of a financial crisis. They are unlikely to show a profit in the year of withdrawal, and they urgently need the proceeds of the IEDs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another paragraph in this particular motion deals with the fuel tax. Senator Burns may like to note that in spite of his remarks there is no suggestion by the coalition that people in country areas pay less for fuel. We say that the general level of excise is too high and that this very high level impacts particularly on country people. This is another of Labor's broken tax promises and an example of the government's ignorance of the problems faced by rural people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has just increased the fuel tax yet again. This took place on 1 August this year as a flow-on from last year's budget. Rural Australians already pay more for fuel&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>in some places up to 15c more&mdash;than people who live in the city. This impacts on every aspect of rural life, not only on economic life but also on family life. It is much more expensive for people to take their children to play sport or to transport their elderly parents or their elderly relatives to the doctor or the dentist if they have to pay more for fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every one cent increase in the fuel excise costs the farming sector $26.8 million and adds $23.3 million to the cost of the food processing sector which, it is hoped in the future, will be a growth industry in many country areas. How can rural sectors bear increased processing costs like this? Rural sectors simply cannot afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To add insult to injury, very little of the revenue gained from the increased taxes goes back to the rural community to repair roads. Only 8.45 per cent of revenue raised goes into federal road funding, and the government intends for this to drop even further to 7.51 per cent by the year 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to realise that this drought has reduced Australian farming families, in many instances, to a level of living which was previously only imaginable in Third World countries. According to a relief worker in Queensland, Mr David Fenton, entire families are living on kangaroo and feral pig meat until food parcels arrive. Never did I think I would have to document in the Australian parliament that this is the way that Australian farming families are being forced to live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not entirely the fault of government. But the point of our motion today is that government policies have exacerbated the low level of income which farming families are experiencing as a result of the drought. It is very sad, indeed, to realise that people who possess or own 14,000 hectares of land are so broke at the moment that they need to exist on food parcels. Farmers who were willing to accept fodder for their starving stock will not admit that their own families are in danger of not having enough food to eat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Male heads of households in the country are brought up never to admit that there are any problems in family life. The economic constraints being imposed on families today are causing them to suffer unimaginable stress as a result of the drought. I wish to bring this to the attention of the Senate. There are very few rural counsellors available, and the government is ignoring yet again the human side of this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the failure of the government to understand the extreme hardship faced by rural people in drought affected areas has meant untold deprivation for farming families. It is for these reasons that I support this resolution. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After listening yesterday to the remarks of Senator Panizza the conclusion could be reached&mdash;which is reflective of his long experience and good judgment in these areas&mdash;that a freight subsidy might be more appropriate than what was proposed in the original motion and the motion as amended which was moved by Senator Crane. During the latter part of 1991 and into 1992 I was a member of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, along with Senator Crane, Senator Burns who was the chair, Senator Brownhill, and others&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and Senator West. At that time the committee heard good and sound reasons why a transport subsidy could be useful to facilitate the relocation of stock from drought affected areas to areas where fodder was more readily available. We heard those good and sound reasons which described such a proposition as not necessarily being agistment, in the simplest terms, but rather temporary relocation and transport assistance as an emergency measure to save our national genetic base in livestock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As members of that committee we also saw examples of profiteers who relied upon the continued existence of drought somewhere in Australia to allow them to make a lifelong career out of growing fodder for subsidised sale as drought relief. At Casino in New South Wales lucerne was being grown in a prime area, where property values and productivity were high, to send in a subsidised fashion to anywhere there was drought. In other words, starving stock stayed on the drought affected areas in a fragile, survival mode, tenuously clinging to life and desperately awaiting the arrival of quality food. That fodder came from land devoted specifically to meeting that need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate: does that sound efficient? Of course not. We could not possibly increase our international competitiveness by following that sort of nonsense. The reason I raised this case is to illustrate that the application of transport and fodder subsidies can create difficulties and anomalies which may advantage some and disadvantage others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairman, other members of the committee and I had the unpleasant task some two years ago of listening to people in rural Australia describe their situations while they had tears in their eyes and their throats were choked with emotion. I listened today to Senator Burns, the chairman of the committee, when he said that the government will never be able to introduce a scheme which will make everybody happy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think that is what is being asked for at this time. No matter what the words of Senator Crane's motion are, I do not think his intention is to necessarily make everybody happy. I think his intention is to provoke the government to do a little more than is being done at the moment. I understand that intention. If I have ascribed the wrong intention to Senator Crane, I apologise. I do not think Senator Crane intended to make everybody happy; I think he wanted to get a few people a little relief, and quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After lengthy discussions, Senator Crane and I have negotiated a revised motion, and the Democrats will be happy to support part (b) of this motion. We do not support part (a) of the original motion because, quite simply, it is a summary of the coalition's world view. It is essentially opinion and it is not easy to demonstrate that those factors alone caused or exaggerated the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Coulter and Senator Margetts have suggested several times in recent days, there is a good deal of international complexity in the question of climatic change, whether we are talking about the El Nino effect or the greenhouse effect. It is becoming increasingly apparent that the greenhouse effect is less likely to produce a gradual world warming which might be seen as benign and perhaps even advantageous in some areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember the first time the greenhouse concept was raised. There were some people in Tasmania, Senator Murphy, who were expecting to be able to grow bananas in their backyards and they were looking forward to the day when they could. We are now learning that that is not anywhere near as benign. In fact, it is more likely that we will see increasingly frequent unseasonal extremes, such as storms in times when we have not been used to storms and different frequencies of floods and seasonal adjustments, whether they be droughts or changed tornado routes on some continents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is more complicated than the picture painted by part (a) of the motion, which mentions a few government decisions and seeks to ascribe responsibility for the situation to those decisions. While I agree that the income equalisation deposit scheme, which ran from 1976 to 1984, may provide a different financial regime which is much more desirable when planning for drought, after hearing the evidence at the rural and regional affairs committee inquiry which I mentioned before, I want to see the benefits of such a regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revised motion that Senator Crane moved should allow the introduction of effective assistance which may or may not be something like the original IEDs. Senator Crane knows and would agree that that scheme has no capacity whatsoever to introduce immediate relief in a form that would be desirable. That is something we can consider, but I see no reason to support it in the form in which it is presented in part (a) of the motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to part (b). I listened to what Senator Troeth had to say and I understand the passion with which that situation was described, but the concern the Democrats have expressed continually in this place is the differential in the price of fuel in rural areas. From a Tasmanian perspective, when I come to Canberra and hear the constant whingeing and whining about petrol prices here, it seems just a little ridiculous because for some years motor fuel has been cheaper here than it has been in Tasmania&mdash;a result entirely of the free market forces which are allowed to play and seem to be so much admired by both the coalition and the government. I will not mention the third part. I see less reason to concentrate on that. The revised part (b), which Senator Crane has introduced, will gain Democrat support, but I now move:</PARA>

I am familiar with it and I know that severe droughts are horrific things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one is looking at the provision of services in drought, one always has the problem of defining drought. This was an issue at the inquiry that Senator Bell spoke of. How do we identify and define what is a severe drought and the cut-in point for assistance for the farmers? The opposition has not defined it. I have not heard any ideas from the opposition as to how it would define severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue that I think needs never to be forgotten with drought is that it affects the whole community. It affects the country towns and small villages within the rural set-up. It affects the whole community because there is less work for those who rely upon farming for work. Therefore, there is a higher unemployment rate, or lower full employment rate. That places a strain on the government to provide unemployment benefits and it is not a particularly edifying way for people to live. It also affects most markedly those people who are in the small business area in the towns: the food providers, the food shops, the agricultural machinery distributors and fuel distributors. They are affected to a very significant degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard a lot of discussion from the opposition today about what should be done for the farmers, but I wonder how we assist only one part of a community. That would divide a community. The whole of the community has to be looked at, and the opposition has chosen not to do that. I feel particularly sorry and sad about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media commented that the coalition was also suggesting that about one-third of debt be waived for farmers in debt. What happens to those farmers who are relatively debt free? Are we not sending the wrong message to those who have not been good managers? Presumably, no assessment is done as to which farmers have made business decisions which have coincided with the drought. These farmers will certainly survive, but they need assistance under the RAS to tie them over. There is a difference between these farmers and those farmers who are not good businessmen and who do not have business plans. We do not seem to be asking people to assist those who are most in need. We need to target those people if we are to go down this path. We cannot just give everybody something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition keeps talking about waiving the debt of farmers. As I said before, the whole community suffers: the tractor and the farm machinery dealers suffer; the grocery shop owners suffer; and the clothing shop owners suffer. The whole community suffers, unless it is of significant size. Towns such as Bathurst, Orange and Dubbo have significant sized industries. As there is a critical mass in those areas, there is a wide scatter of employment prospects which offers communities a buffer. The smaller communities comprise single manufacturing and single commodity enterprises. The towns are dependent upon one commodity. When that commodity hits a hard time, the whole community hits a hard time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard the comment that there has not been an increase in the number of rural counsellors. That is the greatest load of garbage that I have ever heard. There has been a significant increase in the number of rural counsellors. Also, the existing rural counsellors have had their contracts extended or renewed. They have a particularly hard task to undertake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the inquiry, we kept hearing that it is not just what we are doing that is impacting upon these people; it is what the states are doing. If we are to provide fodder relief and freight assistance, I suggest that it would be much easier if we had a railway line that went from Nyngan to Bourke via Cobar. The Cobar railway line still exists, although they want to flog it off. Bourke has been in drought for four years. The only way fodder can get there is by road.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is the same in Victoria, and I guess South Australia and Western Australia are about to follow suit. The last thing that we want state governments to do to these communities is to strip away these services. During the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, which is inquiring into the rural assistance scheme, I have been asking how easy it is for rural counsellors to get their clients, who may be experiencing financial and emotional or psychological problems or who may be feeling stressed, to see a counsellor who is better able to deal with their problems. Some of them said that it takes them three to four weeks to access any counselling with a social worker or psychologist for support for their clients who are in crisis.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">State governments have a responsibility as well to ensure that those infrastructure supports do not get eroded and are maintained. That appears not to be happening. The other group that I would like to talk about and for whom I feel a great deal of empathy is the wives of the male rural producers. Over one-third of farmers are women. That is a figure that is often forgotten. We keep hearing people talk about men but it is the wives who often are responsible for doing the books. They know what the cash flow is&mdash;or, more likely, is not&mdash;and they are more able to communicate, to discuss, to vocalise their problems, their feelings and what they see as issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the men tend to come from a background of stiff-upper-lip, good British stock who do not complain. But that is not what is needed for people who are under stress. They need to be able to communicate. Stress is being imposed upon the women by their husbands who are feeling inadequate, who are feeling that they have not supported their families adequately and who feel that they have not been good farmers. This pressure that is being felt by the women is extremely large but is something that I do not think is being acknowledged as well as it should be. Certainly, because of the lack of infrastructure by the state governments in the health fields in particular, women are not able to access assistance from these areas. </PARA>

Because the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, came in here and deliberately misled the Senate yet again in suggesting that the coalition would have a third of all farm debt written-off. Yesterday we heard the preposterous and absurd suggestion that $5 billion or $6 billion&mdash;</PARA>

I take the opportunity, because the minister is so ignorant and so incapable of reading, to read to honourable senators exactly what the transcript of the press conference in question said. The shadow minister was asked how much debt should be forgiven or restructured&mdash;sort of debt moratoriums&mdash;and he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I don't know that we're talking about debt moratoriums. But it is plainly the case that lenders from time to time in the current circumstances are forgoing debt and current taxation arrangements do actually allow for that.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, in fact, the truth. It is, I have to say, rather difficult to know the extent to which that will be necessary in the future but, plainly, if we allow mass farm failures in certain areas we are going to have a lot of debt loss. The important bit is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a rule of thumb, I would have thought, that if you look at that portion of debt which is directly attributable to severe drought&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>That is not total debt. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;in places like the Downs, then I would suggest that we're looking at a need probably relieve something like a third of that portion of the debt load.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the minister, instead of taking Mr Anderson's constructive comments and listening and saying, `Yes, let's see what we can do about this problem,' sought to dissemble. He sought to dissemble in this parliament. That is shameful and it is shows the lack of regard that this government has for this matter. Lest any other government senator should similarly seek to dissemble I seek the leave of the Senate to table the transcript of the conference which Mr Anderson held on 31 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now move to the subjective issue of the motion, as I understand that the Democrats are seeking to amend the motion and to delete paragraph (a). I find that disappointing. I would have thought that at a time when the bush needs help the Democrats would have the good sense to support the coalition and to recognise that it will only come if pressure is brought to bear on this government, because this government has been recalcitrant, to say the least, when it comes to helping farmers and helping those in need on the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the Democrats, for their own political purposes, do not wish to condemn the government. That is a decision which they are going to have to live with. I say to Senator Bell and Senator Spindler that that is lamentable and sad. However, I recognise the fact that they are supporting the motion as amended and I thank them for that. So the government is now looking down the barrel of the fact that it will be called upon to do something it has been loath to do&mdash;provide some assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, it will be called upon to provide more realistic and effective assistance to preserve the national breeding flock and herd, to suspend the assets test on the various educational and social benefits and to apply only the ordinary income test while the drought continues. We on this side of the chamber consider that to be the barest minimum. We can see from Mr Anderson's media release outlining the coalition's policy that our policy goes further and is a policy of consideration, compassion and humanity. More importantly, our policy of keeping farmers on the land and preserving the herd and flock provides the means for recovering more quickly from drought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing is very welcome indeed. The committee and particularly its chairperson, Senator Newman, deserve congratulation for this report, which fills a vacuum that people in public life in Australia have felt for a long time. Firstly, the report addresses the need to change community attitudes so that whistleblowing is accepted as an essential part of the government process as a whole. Secondly, it sets down a number of reporting systems and procedures which would be desirable. Finally, it creates an independent public interest disclosures agency and board to handle the flow of whistleblowing statements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of this agency is the central point in the recommendations and I trust that the government will take speedy action to implement it. The role of the agency is to receive public interest disclosures and to arrange for their investigation by an appropriate authority; to ensure the protection of people making such disclosures; to provide a national education program; and to make and oversee the implementation of recommendations relating to its role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other areas that I would like to address in some detail. Firstly, there is the area of the investigation of victimisation. I have had a number of submissions from people in Victoria who would like to be whistleblowers but who in the end, because they felt that reprisals would cause them a lot of difficulty personally and in their careers, desisted from proceeding with their disclosures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The community is the poorer for that. The provisions in the report which deal with investigation, rectification and penalties for the victimisation of whistleblowers are extremely important. The committee recommends that whistleblower legislation makes provision for a tort of victimisation&mdash;a major step, but one which I believe deserves consideration by the government. The committee further recommends that the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, through an extension of its powers, provide an alternative forum and course of action for the public and private sector whistleblowers to facilitate their obtaining compensation for victimisation. I think that rounds off the measures in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other side to this issue, to which Senator Cooney drew attention in his contribution to the debate, is that whistleblowing can be misused by people who simply wish to pursue a private desire to harm somebody or to make a criticism which in turn is found to be unsubstantiated. There must be some protection for the subjects of whistleblowing which takes account of that eventuality. The committee recommends that the rights of the subjects of whistleblowing be protected in accordance with the principles of natural justice. I believe that is important. While I share the concerns that have been expressed, I believe that the recommendations make adequate provision for this potential problem and should not be a factor that leads the government to disregard the very valuable recommendations of the committee, which I trust will be implemented as a matter of urgency in legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak very briefly to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994, supporting the amendments moved by my colleague Senator Short and particularly referring to the item of grants to the states for roads. In listening to the debate earlier, I almost choked when I heard the contribution from Senator Kernot about the supposed concern she and her party have for regional Australia. I could not let go unchallenged some of the things that Senator Kernot was pontificating on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot and the Australian Democrats pretend to those people in regional Australia that they have a concern for them; they feign interest in them and pretend to have some policies that might be of benefit to them. Senator Kernot was talking about the payroll tax and what an iniquitous tax it was. Yet at the last federal election, when the coalition indicated the funding for the abolition of payroll tax by the states, what did the Democrats do? Did they support us on that? Did they give any encouragement to the coalition in relation to that? No. They did what they could do to ensure that their friends in the Australian Labor Party were re-elected and that their caucus buddies to the right of them in the Labor Party were returned to government. As the coalition was not elected to government, it was not possible to implement our proposals for the abolition of payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats pretend that they have an interest in the country. Recently at a rally I happened to pick up the Democrats' policy record for all Australians. In reading through this document, I find that the Democrats want the people of rural and regional Australia to pay an extra 17.5c per litre for fuel. That is the Australian Democrats' commitment to regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extra 17.5c per litre for all Australians would be a difficult tax. It would be additionally difficult for those of us who live in regional Australia because, as of necessity, we have to use our vehicles over greater distances and time. To get the produce of regional Australia to the ports and to get back into regional Australia some of the necessities of life requires transport&mdash;and transport requires fuel. And this crowd, who masquerade as a force in Australian politics, want to increase the price of fuel by 17.5c a litre!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, as we all know, the Democrats will never be in a position to implement these policies. But what concerns me is that this gives encouragement to the highest taxing government in history&mdash;the current federal government&mdash;to increase taxes yet again and to increase taxes on fuel. If there is one thing that will destroy regional Australia, it is increasing the price of fuel. In the regions I come from&mdash;in all parts of Australia&mdash;adding 17.5c per litre to the price of fuel would make petrol for the ordinary motorist almost $1 a litre. How could the regions ever be developed if those sorts of taxes on fuel are being imposed on the essential commodity that is needed to live in and develop regional Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Democrats ever want any credibility whatsoever in regional Australia they have to get rid of that policy of an additional 17.5c a litre. I know they will not, because they are engaged in an enormous battle with the Western Australian Greens for the hearts, minds and, more importantly, the votes of the environment movement. They have some agenda that increasing the price of fuel will stop a lot of the pollution problems in the cities&mdash;and that may be right. But this sort of policy would just destroy regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that in their policy they say, `We'll compensate regional Australia.' There is no detail of that&mdash;and there is never any detail. Of course, that is the luxury of being a minor party representing less than five per cent of Australian opinion. They can say what they like because they will never have to deliver. They can make these vague promises and get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am not concerned that the Democrats are ever likely to be anywhere where they can implement this. But it does give the Labor Party the encouragement to again increase taxes on fuel. The Senate would know that the Labor government continues to rip off Australian motorists with tax. The tax on fuel went up again on 1 August. It did not happen by legislation&mdash;nothing went through the parliament&mdash;it went up automatically. The highest taxing government in history makes taxes even higher, and it happens automatically. It is the greatest threat one will ever see to the development of regional Australia. So I have those concerns about the government's taxing of fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I return to the issue that I wanted to briefly mention in relation to the States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994. An amount of $350 million has been allocated as identified arterial roads grants to the states. According to the speech of the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray) and to the bill, these funds are to be distributed on the basis of the average of the arterial road allocations over the three years to 1992. In the next two financial years, the aggregate level of funds will be indexed to movements in financial assistance grants, which is almost like the CPI but not quite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I notice somewhere in the supporting material that, at the end of the 1996-97 year, there is a suggestion that grants to the states for roads will no longer be identified and that they will be bound up in the general assistance grants to the states. That is as I read it. I hope that the minister will be able to indicate to me that that is not the case and that that has not yet been decided. But if that is this government's policy, I express a concern for the proposal's consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, for Australia's sake, the Labor Party will not be in government at the end of the 1997 financial year. But it is worth considering the impact that might occur if these grants for roads were not separately identified but included in the general purpose grant. We as a parliament should look very seriously at that. As we as a parliament are allocating moneys for roads and giving those allocations to another government&mdash;that is, either the state government or local government&mdash;we should really insist that they continue to be identified. If they are not identified, it becomes too easy for state and local governments to confuse the issue of what money is spent on roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I suspect that this would not happen with responsible local and state governments. But, as a federal parliament, we should always identify the moneys that are allocated by the federal government for roads to let the Australian public know what moneys are allocated. The roads around Australia are in a shocking condition. Funding from the federal government for roads generally has fallen quite dramatically in the last 10 years since the Fraser government. Money granted for road making has fallen back at a time when money received from fuel excise has increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, you would be only too well aware that over $10 billion is now ripped off the Australian motorists in fuel tax. Less than $1 billion&mdash;a little over $800 million&mdash;is allocated by the federal government for roads. That is simply not good enough. Australia's major infrastructure investment in roads is falling to pieces&mdash;it is just collapsing around our ears&mdash;and this government does not seem to care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one thing that this country desperately needs, it is greater infrastructure spending, particularly in the area of roads&mdash;not just so we can have nice roads to drive on but because the wealth of the country is developed in regional Australia and roads are an essential part of getting that wealth to our overseas customers, earning export dollars for Australia and making Australia a better place to live in. I hope that the government will very carefully watch that matter of identification of moneys allocated for roads, pitiful though the amount from this government is. In my view, it should continue to be identified and I ask the government to keep that in mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994 puts in place the agreement reached with the states on general revenue assistance over the next three years and on the formula for determining future apportionment between states. It also deals with some specific factors on roads and higher education grants. While this is a bill attached to the outcome of negotiations between the states and Commonwealth, it must be noted that the Commonwealth, as the primary collector of revenue, has a disproportionate power in any negotiations. This can be seen as what the Commonwealth has been able to impose and what it has conceded in order to impose it. It is not a states based or states driven agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth funding, to a considerable extent, sets the options the states have. Commonwealth agendas can be pushed&mdash;and indeed are pushed here. It makes a lie of any claims the Commonwealth makes in regard to some issues that they are state matters. The Commonwealth can and does use its economic power to pursue its own agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a few substantive issues in this bill and some general issues that this bill relates to. Overall, this bill relates to the economic fundamentalist push that the Commonwealth and many state governments have been pursuing. While the bill assures that financial assistance grants to states and territories will be maintained in real terms over the next three years, it does not even account for all general purpose revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On other fronts, we have seen the states squeezed, both through direct funding and through the Loan Council, as part of the agenda of increasing productivity by limiting funds and asking states to do the same things for less money. In practice, it has often meant that the states make do on less money by reducing services or reducing the quality of services. Many of the cuts in education, health and other social service programs can be put down to this sort of squeeze to tighten economics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While financial assistance grants are held constant in real terms, Loan Council capital grants will now disappear, leaving the better cities program as the only source of general purpose capital payments. The total for general purpose capital grants will now decrease from $543 million to $260 million. Capital works will increasingly need to be funded from external borrowings. States are also required to pay off loans taken on their behalf by the government at an accelerated rate, nearly doubling this year from $927 million to $1,761 million&mdash;a transfer of funds from state to Commonwealth larger than the total transfer the other way through general revenue grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This transfer is likely to be funded largely through state based commercial debt. The last meeting of states saw the next ratchet of funding squeezed as an agreement to the national competition policy recommendations traded against an untying of grants. While this can be seen as an improvement since it reduces the apparent power of the Commonwealth, I cannot feel good about this. Firstly, states are often more arrogant than the Commonwealth in their assumption of centralist power and, secondly, the nature of state governments is likely to mean that more control at state level means the progressive erosion of social infrastructure, particularly that designed to promote equity in the states own New Right economic push. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see a lot of joy in a shift from Commonwealth slash and burn economics to the scorched earth policies under the Kennett government, for instance. The national competition policy, with its emphasis on privatisation and corporatisation of state social infrastructure&mdash;power, water and so on&mdash;is also nothing to rejoice in. It simply pushes the agenda of the New Right further. This is the context of this bill. Specific issues include the treatment of states on the basis of population. This will impact particularly on my state of Western Australia and on Queensland and the Northern Territory. These states and territory add disproportionately to Australia's economic wellbeing and have the problems of vast areas and low populations. There are measures for special grants, but they are one-off measures and, afterwards, the territory and these states will be left to their own devices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The treatment of less populous states does not reflect the basic needs of rural people or incorporate equity principles and can only lead to a further erosion of rural services. Health and education are among these services. It will also affect a plethora of smaller service areas such as the provision of libraries and their quality, access to government offices, and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that these are state affairs and so Commonwealth policy has no impact on them is arrant nonsense. The erosion of rural services will continue through the push for privatisation and corporatisation of public utilities, as organisations try to improve competition policy by adopting user pays policies which will see the prices rural people pay for basic needs go up. They will pay the same kind of premiums that these people now pay for all kinds of other goods, from food to consumer durables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope the opposition, and particularly the National Party, takes note of this. It will require a lot of careful scrutiny of legislation and will require the moral fortitude and political will to make sure that obligations to rural people are enshrined in any framework for privatised services that comes up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already see the sort of thing that I am talking about in the increase of electricity prices for rural users in Victoria. Premier Kennett has said he would announce further details of the new pricing structure today ahead of the privatisation of the State Electricity Commission. It is the wave of the future, as the principle of value that all Australians should have equal access to basic services, including price equality, gives way to the economics which say that the only value the community is allowed to have is the value of the dollar, and it is not allowed to see any market factors involving dollars incorporate the strong community value of a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in the comment by Senator Ian Macdonald in relation to roads and the cost of petrol. Just a few days ago I pointed out that the indications are that the amount of liquid petroleum in the world market is about to peak. Because of our reluctance to see this kind of information, the price of petroleum products, because of the market, will increase incredibly in a relatively short time. Unless we actually start doing things which incorporate equity and look at ways of reducing our dependence on such things as liquid petroleum in our farming and other industry sectors, then we are going to be extremely vulnerable. When we talk about equity we have to talk about future equity at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens have always supported the principle that basic services should be equally available to all Australians. We believe the community supports this idea and has done so for many years. We believe this is why there have been equal price policies in most states on electricity and so on. But with privatisation it is hard to make this work. Companies like to come and pick the eyes out of a market and then use this to undersell other companies, including public ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only options to such circumstances are highly regulated private industries, public industries that only serve the people who would otherwise be disadvantaged, or the abandonment of the community value of support for rural users. No-one has asked the community, and it appears that the Premier of Victoria prefers to abandon the rural members of his state rather than enact any regulation of community obligation. I give warning that this might be one of the first such cases, but it is not likely to be the last. We will see government progressively abandon its obligations of equitable service provision to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this bill sees identified road grants nearly double from $175 million to $350 million. As the Senate realises, we believe there are better ways to deal with transport, both rural and urban, than building more roads. However, we do note that this $350 million must be taken in the context of a transferral of funds from specific purpose grants, where road grants under that program declined by $193 million. I note that not only are these road grants no longer tied to specific purposes but now, under clause 11, they are not even tied to roads, and the intention is that the classification will disappear in 1996-97 and be absorbed into general purpose grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this is so bad, especially if state governments can be convinced to use this funding, or some of it anyway, to actually address some of the transport and urban structure issues I bring up frequently. Maybe the better cities program can work to facilitate a change in the way such funding is often committed. The better cities program, which, incidentally, had a display in parliament house yesterday, is a limited period program and is liable to be winding down over the next few years unless government commits some funding to replace or extend it. If not, the other source of general capital grants to states will also disappear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue relates to student unions, which others have already emphasised. Clause 15 clearly shows that the Commonwealth can push an issue if it wishes. We support this issue and feel it is important from an equity standpoint. We feel it is consistent with the proper role of the Commonwealth to assure that basic social standards are met for all Australians, regardless of where they are.

The government must treat that money as student association money and not let it be slowly eroded away by enforcing conditions and cutbacks, as happens with other federal funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessity of keeping student associations is clear.

With HECS the government could hide fees under the guise of tax on education.

These entrenched the view that little or no more public funding would be spent on tertiary education because market needs can be met by the current system. The report proposes some options for funding, including redistributing existing funds and places; charging different amounts of HECS for different courses, which would be totally inequitable; and charging up-front fees of between $500 and $1,000 for every student on top of HECS. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has to be taken into account, when considering that the New South Wales government ripped out $52 million given to it by the federal government, that significant kilometres of roads&mdash;over 1,000&mdash;were removed from its responsibility when we took over the responsibility for the Newell Highway and the Sturt Highway in that state. New South Wales has fewer roads for which it is responsible and the Commonwealth has more, yet it put our money not into roads&mdash;which the rural people of New South Wales feel particularly angry about&mdash;but elsewhere. That needs to be graphically highlighted because that is the sort of thing that this conservative government did. Just under $52 million went away from roads. I know many roads in rural New South Wales that are in need of that sort of money, but the state is not going to distribute it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fine for Senator Margetts to talk about needing alternative forms of transport, but when people are out beyond Bourke there is not much else they can do except travel on a road.

That road could have been sealed so that the next time there is a decent flood out there&mdash;please, God, let it be very soon so that the drought ends&mdash;people would have an all-weather road to travel on. At the moment they do not have an all-weather road. If there is half an inch of rain, people are stuck because these are black soil and red soil plain roads. This situation is terrible, but that is what the state government of New South Wales did last financial year. It has been highlighted before by the shires association president and the shadow minister, but I think it deserves to keep being highlighted that this is the sort of treatment that the people of New South Wales cop from their current government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Details of the consultancies for the previous financial year, which cost over $30,000, show that over $940,000 was spent in the roads and traffic area. I do not know whose money that was&mdash;whether it was ours or theirs&mdash;but it has come out of the Roads and Traffic Authority budget. If it was not our money, ours has obviously had to stretch a bit further. Those consultancies were for private tollway economic and noise impact advice for the M5. The NSW state government is using government money to help the private contractors. There is the issue of whether there should be private involvement anyway&mdash;I do not want to get into that&mdash;but now we have government money being used. </PARA>

For the consultancies costing less than $30,000, we know that another half a million dollars was spent by the Roads and Traffic Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They are the sorts of things that the New South Wales state government has been getting up to. Whilst it might not have been our money it was spending in all those situations, it certainly would have had an impact upon the effect that the Commonwealth money could have had. We know also that last year in the state budget speech there was a further one per cent saving to be delivered in most budget sector agencies. It excluded front-line health and teaching areas and community services. It said that the departments that would be required to deliver the one per cent saving would do so by reducing unnecessary bureaucracy, not by cutting services at the coalface. However, $52 million of Commonwealth money was ripped out of the Roads and Traffic Authority. I do not know how that quite ties up. </PARA>

We know that this year Mr Collins and Mr Baird have given firm guarantees that they will expend all of the money the Commonwealth gives to them on roads, but it still does not make up for the $52 million they ripped off last year.

The question of voluntary association is one which is vital to Liberal philosophy, and it is one which I have been involved in since 1977 when I was on the University of Western Australia campus. In fact, I was a member of the Guild Council of the University of Western Australia and a president of the Public Affairs Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note today that a number of speakers have mentioned that making membership of these guilds and associations voluntary might result in the diminution of services to students. When I ran for that guild position I made it a platform to provide cheaper food and drink for students, but I can tell the Senate that I was not successful in my endeavours and during my time at university I really did not see any appreciable service or benefit afforded to students from that guild. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I question very much the expenditure and accounting of the funds that are poured into these associations. In fact, I believe that if the government is serious about its obedience to the United Nations and its various declarations it should remember that the United Nations Declaration on Human Rights upholds the principle of voluntary association&mdash;the individual's right to choose whether or not to belong to an association. Belonging to an association includes not just the membership of the association but the payment of fees which would follow. Student unions and associations, which I believe are not representative of the vast mainstream student population, are receiving this windfall from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to provide an example of the activities which this government obviously endorses in relation to the payment of taxpayers' funds to student guilds, associations and unions.

<PARA>That might all be terribly amusing. I, for one, would not deny that when I was at university I indulged in a great deal of fun and tongue-in-cheek activities, but this is a body which is supposed to be handling the funds paid by students to the membership of this organisation. It is a responsible position. I recall from my days in the guild that hundreds of thousands of dollars passed through that guild. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite another more recent example relating to the Guild of Undergraduates at the University of Western Australia. A person by the name of Geoff Baker, who is employed at the Guild of Undergraduates and who is also the Young Labor secretary, used his guild number in an advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> 23 August 1994 as a contact for people who were interested in joining the Young Labor movement. The advertisement is headed, `Interested in politics? Are you under 26? Then join Young Labor.' One of the numbers is Geoff Baker's&mdash;3802211. If that is not indulging in politically biased activity whilst being paid by student funds&mdash;and in this case the student is employed by the Guild of Undergraduates&mdash;then I do not know what is. Taxpayers' money is being channelled into these guilds and student unions and the state government is powerless to do anything about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People might say that students do not have to pay their guild fees. That is true but, then again, taxpayers' money is going to prop up student activities. It does not matter whether this is a Labor biased guild, a Liberal biased guild, or a Democrat or Green biased guild. What is happening is that there is political bias. Taxpayers' money is being used to prop up student political activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not convinced that the guilds of undergraduates across the country provide the services that they should. I believe that if student unionism was voluntary, then the heat would be on the student guild to provide better services so that people would join it to experience those services. So they would go all out to direct those funds into vital services such as cheaper food, drink and housing, child minding and the like but not spent on politically biased activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I experienced this in the 1970s. It has gone on in the 1980s and I have just given an example that there is that same bias in the 1990s.

I put it to honourable senators that this flier is not offering any objective analysis to the students of that campus but that it is entirely biased to one mind-set, one political mode of thought. That is where the taxpayers' money will be going, to prop up that sort of student activism and not to essential services that have been mentioned by previous speakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, they say that a politician is like an acrobat: he keeps his balance by saying one thing and doing another.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In early November 1989, Mr N.J. Heiner, a retired Stipendiary Magistrate was engaged under the former National Party government by the Department of Family Services to investigate and report on certain matters relating to the John Oxley Youth Centre.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In January 1990, Mr Heiner approached the Acting Director-General Ms Ruth Matchett expressing concern about the legal basis and authority of Mr Heiner's appointment, the establishment of the investigation and hence, the conditions under which it was being conducted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice received from the Crown Solicitor indicated that, although Mr Heiner had been lawfully appointed as an independent contractor to perform his tasks, there were certain practical considerations which made it inadvisable for the investigation to continue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the potentially defamatory nature of the material gathered and the limited value of its continuation, the Department of Family Services decided to terminate the investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following advice from the State Archivist and Crown Solicitor, Cabinet decided on 5th March 1990 that the material gathered by Mr Heiner be handed to the State Archivist for destruction under the terms of section 55 of the Librarian and Archives Act 1988. On 23rd March 1990, the State Archivist destroyed the material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considerations in reaching this decision were:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any suggestion, real or imagined, that a public official was led to "falsely destroy public records in order to obstruct justice" is not only totally wrong, but also without foundation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Again, this is totally without foundation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Nunan, a member of the Queensland Bar, was appointed by the independent Criminal Justice Commission, not the Queensland Government, to investigate a payment made by the Government to Mr Coyne.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to bring the Senate's attention to an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on page 38, headed `Boat people ready for settlement: lawyer'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A group of Cambodian boat people suing the Commonwealth for unlawful detention was prepared to negotiate a settlement and save the Federal Government a long and costly High Court action, lawyer Paul Mallam said yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA>Admirable; but, if he were really interested in saving money, he would withdraw the very expensive action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote now, in part, from a letter of today's date, from the Australian Government Solicitor, Dr J.G. Renwick, to Mr Mallam:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second point you make is that you hold an open mind on a possible settlement of this matter and are disposed to exploring such a possibility. You referred to a comment by Mr Sullivan to the Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that `if there is a view from the other side that the matter should be settled, an offer should be put for consideration . . . '. Mr Sullivan went on to say `but there has not been an offer put.' The Minister notes that in your letter of 13 July 1994 this matter has been taken no further as you still have not put forward a formal offer. Were the Minister to receive such an offer, which he would welcome, he will give it careful consideration, of course, conscious of his obligations under the law and the provisions of section 54RA of the Migration Act 1958.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you forwarded a copy of your letter to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, I have done likewise.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that two views are being put forward. I am being careful how I speak about this matter because I am aware that there is legislation on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> covering this particular matter. When the issue of negotiating settlements comes up, I will be one within the caucus of the parliamentary Labor Party who will be opposing any such form of settlement. The Government Solicitor-General's letter states that the hands of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) are tied because compensation is limited to legislation and the laws which are currently on the statute books&mdash;that is, $1 per day. I will also be opposing any form of settlement discussed in the caucus immigration and ethnic affairs committee of which I am the deputy chairperson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter so I could put some of the views of my constituents on the public record. The survey forms are held in my Perth electorate office and they are anonymous so I cannot trace where they came from. There were some interesting comments made. I encouraged people to make individual comments, some of which state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turn them around at sea when it becomes obvious they are headed for Australia</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their country should have to pay for the refuelling</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let people know in their country that they are not welcome by this method of JUST ARRIVING</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe we have allowed enough boat people into the country. I feel anyone from these countries can apply for refugee status, there is not enough investigating before they are allowed in the country. If a criminal offence is committed, they should be deported immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we did not let them in there would be no need to process unauthorised boat people, because they should not be allowed to stay</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our welfare system is already stretched to its limits. We should look after our own people first before any illegal immigrants. We pay our taxes for our benefits, not to feed, house and succumb to other non-resident demands</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian legal system is for Australians</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Too often Australians are refused legal aid, I feel outsiders who are here illegally should not be entitled to what some Aussies are denied</PARA>
<PARA>There are six pages of comments. I do not have time to read them all into the record, but I will finish with two:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for the opportunity of expressing my views</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can tell by the way your questions are framed that you are not really interested in the broader picture, why don't you take real notice of the situation. I believe Bruce Ruxton's figures on boat people were more accurate, than the Government's</PARA>
<PARA>One of the very interesting results to come out of the survey was that 100 per cent of those surveyed said that they would be in support of legislation to stop people illegally in this country suing for damages for what is termed as `unlawful detention'. The onus is on all politicians to take heed of this and perhaps test the water a bit better. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to mention that today is an important day for the people of Bougainville as it is the 19th anniversary of Bougainville Independence Day. It is very significant that we are moving towards a peace process around the time that Bougainville declared independence. I am pleased to see that the newly elected Papua New Guinean Prime Minister, Sir Julius Chan, has placed the Bougainville issue and proposed peace talks at the forefront of the government's agenda.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Sir Julius Chan does not repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, Mr Paias Wingti, who believed there was a military solution to Bougainville and has been a part of PNG's bloodshed and repression in Bougainville. Since the conflict in Bougainville began, we should take time to think about the 5,000 deaths that have occurred in Bougainville, 2,000 of which were children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wingti government strategy relied on a military solution with the object of re-opening the Panguna copper mine. This was an immoral and ill-conceived plan which was doomed to fail. This is because the Panguna copper mine is at the heart of the conflict in Bougainville and not until there is peace should the inherent problems of the mine be worked out between Bougainville and Papua New Guinea. So long as the mine is forcefully taken by one side or another without conciliation and negotiation, so too will the conflict be prolonged. Ultimately, the Wingti government's strategy worked against the consummation of a peace process, tightened the blockade which brought hardship on the local Bougainvillean population and served to intensify the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of these problems were illustrated in the report of the June delegation to Bougainville, led by Senator Loosley, which recommended a peace plan and a non-military solution to the crisis. Unfortunately, the delegation also recommended the tightening of the blockade which has starved many of the local population of medicines and has caused many needless and innocent deaths. Australia's role has been hypocritical. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we espouse these kinds of `peaceful' solutions, we remained awfully quiet as the PNG defence force attacked the BRA at the Panguna copper mine last week. We are complicit in the military aid we provide to Papua New Guinea, the training of elite Papua New Guinea corps to fight in Bougainville and the provision of patrol boats and Iroquois helicopters used in the repressive blockade and war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has trained half the PNG defence force, or around 2,000 soldiers, since the Bougainville conflict began six years ago. This year we are training 201 PNG defence force personnel in Australia and have sent 77 Australian advisers to PNG, most of them from the army with some providing support to the PNG air wing and one adviser with each of the four Australian supplied Pacific class patrol boats. It is also likely that every senior army officer, lieutenant-colonel and above in the PNG defence force was trained at Fort Queenscliff. Brigadier-General Dademo, commander of the PNG defence force, was trained at Fort Queenscliff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia must follow UNESCO Council resolutions 19/92, 76/93 and 81/94 which call upon the PNG government to negotiate a peaceful settlement on Bougainville and to allow humanitarian aid in the country. I am glad that the new Chan government hopes to make the peace process its new priority. On this Bougainville Independence Day I hope it will look favourably at the demands of the BRA, which include an immediate cease-fire and withdrawal of all PNG troops from Bougainville, an immediate lifting of the blockade which has resulted in thousands of needless deaths and the immediate facilitation of medical supplies and humanitarian services to all areas of Bougainville. If the process can amount to respectful negotiation we will be one step closer to resolving this long and violent conflict by peaceful means. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak this evening in support of the recent work of the Australian film industry and particularly to congratulate it on its local and international success. At the last election there was a clear distinction between the commitment given to the arts by this government and the lack of commitment offered by the opposition. While the opposition wanted to restructure the taxation system and turn back the clock towards discredited schemes which the industry has now moved beyond, the government clearly focused on assisting our vibrant arts industry. It is significant that the government's arts and cultural policy document at that election was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS>. Fortunately for the arts community, and the film industry in particular, the opposition did not win in March 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I hope the opposition comes on board now and recognises that there is nothing wrong with the arts community being unashamedly Australian, I regret to say that the new shadow minister for the arts appears determined to follow the lead of his predecessor. In his statement to arts organisations of 8 June 1994, following his appointment as the shadow minister for the arts, Senator Alston demonstrated just how distinctly un-Australian his priorities are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Alston referred to film, he referred to Woody Allen; when he referred to theatre, like his predecessor Senator Baume, he eulogised over Gilbert and Sullivan; and, when he referred to music, his passion was for Freddy Gardiner and Billy Joel. He added that he liked central Asian and Middle Eastern carpets and Third World art, including coptic crosses. There was no mention of Australian film, Australian music or Australian literature, and only a passing reference to Aboriginal art. There was no recognition of the importance of our multicultural society to our artistic and cultural expression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strength of the arts community in being proudly Australian, distinctly Australian, is well represented in this year's film releases. The government's investment in the film industry is reaping rewards. It is pleasing to see these rewards come in both artistic terms and financial terms. The formal recognition of artistic excellence has come through the numerous awards which have been achieved in most recent years, particularly at the Cannes film festival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, 1994, is the third year in a row that Australian films have been the hits at the Cannes film festival. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strictly Ballroom</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Piano</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Muriel's Wedding</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</EMPHASIS> have brought international acclaim to Australia's film industry. This year Australia had the two hit films at the festival. One was voted the most popular and the other was voted the third most popular of all films chosen from throughout the world for official selection. This achievement has never been matched by any other country or film industry outside Hollywood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as these being the most famous with respect to these latest releases, the Australian film industry has impressive depth. Twelve new Australian films were screened during Cannes this year. More than 24 Australian films were represented by 13 sales agents, three of which are Australian. The same success which Australian films achieved at Cannes is now occurring at the Montreal film festival. This was noted in an article in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. Comment was made upon the success at Montreal of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priscilla</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sum of Us</EMPHASIS>. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">[Kevin Dowling, Co-director of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sum Of Us</EMPHASIS>] said the film had done better than expected. "We didn't know how the subtitles would translate and if they would understand the Australian humour."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They did.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"At the first screening, it was absolutely sold out&mdash;a 980-seater&mdash;and they were standing two-deep at the back . . . "</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And many of the jokes received up to three laughs: as the subtitles were not on the print, but projected electronically with a one-second delay, English speakers laughed at things as they happened, French speakers as they read them, and then at each other for the delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dowling said the film's official festival screening, its second, was also packed, this time with 1,200 people.</PARA>
<PARA>The film industry has a unique role in promoting Australia overseas. The current body of films achieving such success depicts Australian life in all of its diversity. The international focus which is placed on Australia because of the popularity of our films can only be beneficial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promotion of Australia overseas through these films provides many economic spin-offs, not the least being the promotion of Australia as a prime tourist destination. The magnificent Australian outback, which is the backdrop to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priscilla</EMPHASIS>, is evidence of this. One cannot overlook the more direct financial benefits in terms of box office takings. The success of Australian films at Cannes resulted in buyers paying, in minimum guarantees, more than $15 million over the course of 10 days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priscilla</EMPHASIS> opened in the United States with a platform release. This means that it opened in seven cinemas in New York, Los Angeles, Seattle and San Francisco. The popularity of this film will see the initial distribution widened to many more screens across America. In its first five days, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Priscilla</EMPHASIS> grossed $US296,817. That figure continues to grow as its success spreads to other locations. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sirens</EMPHASIS> opened in the United Kingdom on 29 July and within about eight days it had grossed in excess of #1,300,000. It was the most popular film at the London box office on the weekend of 5-7 August. Box office success overseas has been well matched by takings within Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Sum of Us</EMPHASIS> opened on 28 July and has already taken $2.3 million at the Australian box office. Its producer, Hal McElroy, has said that its total box office earnings might reach $6 million to $8 million, which will put it in the top 10 grossing Australian films of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's commitment to the Film Finance Corporation has been pivotal to the high quality of our Australian films which we are now all enjoying. It has also ensured that large sections of the profits which Australian films generate are ploughed back into the film industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since entering the Senate in May this year, I have taken the opportunity to meet with representatives of many of the various groups which comprise our film industry. The interaction of these various organisations, in particular the Australian Film Commission, Film Australia and the Film Finance Corporation, is certainly working well, with the proof being in the quality and popularity of this year's releases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These organisations can be rightly proud of the quality of Australian films now being made. We in the government can certainly be proud of the support we are giving to these organisations and to the industry. It is important for all governments at all levels to provide assistance and encouragement for this industry which is doing so much to promote our culture and our artistic and national identity both at home and throughout the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to bring to the attention of the Senate the complete demolition of the ALP government's national training reform agenda in a scathing report by Dr Vince Fitzgerald of Allen Consulting Group. The real irony is that the government and ANTA commissioned this report. What the ALP government got was a highly critical report on its approach to training. This may explain why the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Crean, is actually hiding the report. He has obviously told ANTA to keep it out of sight. How do we know this? Because it was finished three months ago and we have received some access to the contents of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should come out and explain why he has not released it, seeing that it has been ready for three months. Is it not reasonable and proper that a report that has been out for this long should be seen by the Australian parliament? Is it not reasonable and proper that business, which relies so much on well trained staff, should see the report? It is certainly very proper that the youth and the long-term unemployed of Australia, who have been victims of this government's inadequate policies in this area, should see this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why the minister has not released it is that it systematically carves up Labor's credibility on training. That is the reason why the government is hiding it. I quote from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current approach to training reform will not, without change, bring about the fundamental outcomes desired . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Stripped of its bureaucratic jargon, what this means is that Fitzgerald has officially identified what we have all known for a very long time&mdash;that is, the government's training policies are not working, they are not putting the long-term unemployed back to work and they are not putting the youth of this country back to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This came out most starkly to all Australians when they watched in embarrassment Minister Beazley's performance on television in front of an audience of youth in Wollongong. As he explained what the government was doing for training and how marvellous the government's program was, the youth in the audience kept yelling back at him, `But there are no jobs.' They identified the basic underlying problem: there were no jobs linked to the training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people in Wollongong told me that in Wollongong they have the best trained dole queues in the world. People  undertake training courses, but there are no jobs at the end of it and not much training linked with it either. They would do another training course and there would be no job at the end of that. So it goes on, cynically keeping them off the unemployment queue so that unemployment figures look much lower. The government has a systematic program of doing this&mdash;of removing groups from the unemployment queue. Mature age people&mdash;older people&mdash;are the latest to be removed from the queue. It makes the figures look a lot better, but it does not solve the fundamental underlying problem for the 870,000 people in this country who are still without jobs&mdash;half of them long-term unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fitzgerald has recommended a complete change in direction on training policy. In Europe this was recognised a long time ago. OECD reports are very critical of Australia for not doing what a lot of other countries have done, and that is realise that training and work must be intimately linked if they are going to provide long-term employment for people. We have some good models in Australia and it is a great pity the government is not adopting and pushing these around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own area of Maitland, the Hunter Valley Training Co. has a number of very successful programs which have linked workshop training to actual job experience and to theory. Those very successful training programs have now taken off in a number of areas in New South Wales. But such programs are limited and are only a small part of the total picture. The Dusseldorp Corporation, which started the TRAC scheme in Newcastle in the area of commerce, links training and work experience very closely. This is another great model. We have the overseas example and the local example in this area, but the government persists in putting an enormous amount of money into a lot of training that does not have work related experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fitzgerald was on the right track when he said that Australia should follow this overseas experience; it should link work and training together. The government stands condemned for not doing that and it stands condemned tonight, in particular, for taking three months to release a report when so many people out of work could benefit from its outcomes. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The results of two trials carried out by Merck, Sharp and Dohme using cattle were evaluated by the Chemical Safety Unit of the Department of Human Services and Health using an analytical method suitable for residue analysis of clorsulon in cattle meat and offal. The method has a limit of determination for unchanged clorsulon of 0.1 mg/kg, which is also the level set for the maximum residue limit. Both trials demonstrated that the level of clorsulon residues had fallen to below the level of analytical determination by 21 to 28 days after dosing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From those trials it was concluded that there was adequate data to support maximum residue limits of 0.1 mg/kg in both cattle meat and offal. The withholding period of 42 days is more than adequate for clorsulon given the above depletion rates.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Ivermectin and clorsulon have quite different modes of action and therefore different spectra of activity. From this it can be predicted that additive effects between these two therapeutic agents is unlikely. In studies of rodents and other species, clorsulon and ivermectin exhibit quite different patterns of toxic signs at greatly different dose levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Toxicological studies as required by the National  Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (NRA) were carried out by Merck, Sharp and Dohme and assessed by the Chemical Safety Unit. These studies included acute toxicity, short-term repeat dose studies, sub-chronic studies, long term studies, as well as reproduction, developmental and genotoxicity studies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those studies support the expectation from pharmacological and mode of action studies that ivermectin and clorsulon will not interact with each other. In acute toxicity testing on rodents, the toxicity of the formulation containing both compounds is similar in signs and dose level to that of ivermectin given alone. There was no evidence that the toxicity of either compound was affected by the concurrent administration of the other.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) State control-of-use laws make it a criminal offence to administer Ivomec-Plus (ivermectin plus clorsulon) to cows within 28 days prior to calving or during lactation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the purpose of detecting residues of clorsulon the maximum residue limit has been set at the minimum limit of analytical determination. Strict monitoring of residues in milk is undertaken by milk authorities, together with traceback procedures to the point of use if residue limits have been exceeded. Dairy farmers are aware of the consequences, including commercial consequences, in the event that residues of a chemical product are detected in the milk supplied by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Technical details in respect of the above studies can be obtained from the NRA.</PARA>
