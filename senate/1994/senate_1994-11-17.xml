<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The Prime Minister's rhetoric consistently claims that Australia is well placed to cope with zero tariffs by 2010. Is it a fact that Australia's growth rate is around four to five per cent, when Taiwan, Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Thailand and Malaysia are running at between six and nine per cent? Is it a fact that Australia has one of the lowest, if not the lowest, level of exports as a percentage of output in the region? Is it a fact that Australia's real interest rate is about the highest in the region, with the exception of Indonesia? Is it also a fact that we have the highest unemployment rate&mdash;nine per cent, compared with rates of three per cent or less for many of the Asian economies which are members of APEC? Why is it that Australia performs so poorly when compared with its Asian neighbours? Why do we keep running into current account problems? Why can Australia not sell more of its GDP abroad, instead of consuming itself? Is it not about time we had some real micro-economic reform in this country, if we want to avoid being taken to the cleaners by APEC?  <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One hears occasions when people fundamentally and comprehensively miss the point, but rarely so spectacularly as on this occasion with Senator Alston. The truth of the matter is that Australia is the second biggest developed economy in the whole of the East Asian-Oceania region. Our growth is proceeding against a base which is very much larger than that of any other developed economy in the region, except Japan's. Our economy, in GDP terms, has been, until very recently, equivalent to the six ASEAN economies all put together. I think it is now equivalent to about five of them, because they have been growing so fast. We have an environment where the Australian economy is extraordinarily competitive, extraordinarily resilient and extraordinarily capable of doing everything we want it to be able to do to take advantage of this brilliant new opportunity that has opened up for us as a result of the APEC conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator McMullan was saying on radio, I think this morning, it is really just a matter of what cast of mind we bring to these sorts of situations. Either we bring the pessimistic, dog-in-the-manger, miserable, mean-spirited cast of mind that Senator Alston so admirably represents in this place and say, `Australia can't do it. Australia is bound to be lagging behind whatever action is going on elsewhere,' or we say, `This is a phenomenal opportunity that has opened up for us to get much greater penetration and access into these markets around the region than we have ever previously been able to do.' We can do so from a base of micro-economic reform; we can do so from a base of trade liberalisation of a unilateral kind; and we can do so from the base of tariffs and quotas and so on which make us already very close to meeting these objectives that are being mapped in the APEC process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will have an average effective rate of assistance down to 2.9 per cent by the year 2000. That will be in spectacular contrast to most of our regional neighbours. We will have automotive down to 15 per cent and we will have TCF down to 25 per cent by the year 2000, which will be in spectacular contrast to the sorts of rates of 100, 150 and 200 per cent plus which are prevailing still very widely in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are already competitive in terms of our capacity to penetrate those markets even against barriers of that size. And with this particular process at work and operating to create a whole new environment in the region of many many more points of accessibility elsewhere, the opportunities for us and what this represents for us represent nothing but good value. It is an outstanding opportunity to build on the strengths that we have.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have an economy with a growth rate that is as high as Senator Alston says, which puts us in spectacular contrast to the rest of the developed world, and against the base on which that growth is building it puts us in very good company indeed in the region. We have got inflation that is still absolutely rock solidly under control. We have got investment growing phenomenally strongly; new assets increased 10.5 per cent in the June quarter; and investment in new plant and equipment increased 13.4 per cent in that quarter. We have got an economy that is perfectly poised and perfectly shaped to take advantage of this new opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to be doing is instilling a sense of confidence and optimism in those entrepreneurs who are now going to get out there and take advantage of these opportunities, not just sitting around talking the economy down, as Senator Alston is so spectacularly wont to do, and has done again on this occasion.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I notice that the minister did not deny any of those propositions which demonstrate beyond doubt that Australia is very poorly placed relative to its neighbours and is prepared to rely on blind optimism. We heard the minister talk about a base of micro-economic reform. When are we going to have some real micro-economic reform in this country? The minister talks about a `rock solid' base of inflation being under control. Why is the government rolling over in front of Bill Kelty? Why is the government letting him decide that Australia can afford 15 per cent wage increases across the board? Why does the government not do something tough about the economy if it is so serious and hopeful about what is going to happen in the future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Why don't you do something tough?', he says. `Why don't you do something tough like slashing the budget?', when every time he opens his mouth in terms of expenditure it is in order to suggest that we ought to be spending more on something else. `Why don't you act tough on wages policy?' those opposite say, when they were responsible when they were last in government for the kind of inattention and irresponsibility to both micro-economic reform and industrial relations reform that created the conditions that drove this country onto the rocks over and over again in those past decades.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the point about wages policy, of course it is not surprising in times of economic activity like this that significant wage increases would be sought across enterprises in various industries. What is absolutely crucial is that those wage improvements are associated with productivity improvements at the enterprise level and are tailored to the need of individual enterprises. And that is exactly what Bill Kelty said and what is reported in the paper this morning.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FY5">Senator DENMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I refer to the current trial of the clean food marketing campaign being undertaken in Taiwan. Can the minister inform the Senate whether this campaign has had any impact on the attitude of Taiwanese consumers to Australian food?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3230" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an extremely appropriate question after the tirade we just heard from Senator Alston, because it is a small but useful indication as to just what benefits do await Australia from the APEC success. The clean food marketing campaign has been designed specifically to market and promote Australia's food exports to Taiwan on the basis of Australia's comparatively clean environment&mdash;a recognised competitive advantage, Senator Alston, that our country has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The marketing activities undertaken over a period of five months to September 1994 include four periods of television advertising, seven weeks of supermarket promotions, and involvement in a number of trade fairs. There are 19 Australian companies which are licensees to the program, ranging from major players such as Goodman Fielder, statutory marketing bodies, including the Australian Dairy Corporation, to relatively small companies such as Hartz mineral water from Tasmania. I am pleased to advise the Senate that Arnotts Ltd has just confirmed that it will join the campaign and will begin marketing its products in Taiwan almost immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Clean Food Marketing Australia company commissioned a special report comparing results from consumer surveys conducted at the beginning and the end of the trial period. This campaign has been running for only a relatively short period of time but the findings are extremely encouraging.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They include the fact that the spontaneous awareness of Australia as a source of imported food products increased from 21 per cent to 41 per cent. One in three Taiwanese now considers Australia a supplier of high quality foods&mdash;a 50 per cent increase in that response. Over half of the Taiwanese consumers polled now perceive Australia as a clean environment. The incidence of Taiwanese who are consciously purchasing Australian imported products increased significantly, from 54 per cent to 81 per cent, representing a major increase in clear intention to buy Australian food products.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These survey results will form one part of a comprehensive evaluation of the Taiwan trial, which will also analyse the views of the licensees, local distributors and key stakeholders, including the government. The Agrifood Council, which initiated this clean food campaign and which is co-chaired by Senator Cook and me, will meet in Canberra tomorrow to, among other things, consider the draft evaluation report and determine a position on whether this campaign should be extended into other Asian markets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agrifood Council will also be finalising a document for public release which takes stock of the council's activities over the last two years and identifies core priorities to be pursued by the council into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this week's historic decision by APEC leaders in which Australia, and particularly the Prime Minister, took a leading role creates enormous opportunities for Australian exporters into the Asia-Pacific region. An effective clean food marketing campaign could be the means for many food exporters in Australia to grasp these opportunities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is in two parts, is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. The Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Port Hinchinbrook project has more to do with politics than it has to do with the environment.</PARA>
<PARA>Is he referring to the internal Labor Party brawl over the sacking of left wing president Ian McLean or is he referring to the minister's insatiable desire to get the Green vote, regardless of the cost? Further, Mr Goss said that the huge, ugly mud hole that is now Port Hinchinbrook is `nothing more or less than a monument to the way in which Senator Faulkner has handled this matter between June and yesterday'. How is the minister going to restore his monument, this ugly mud hole, now that he has acquired it for the Commonwealth, after he has driven both the developer and the Queensland government out of business? How much will it cost to rehabilitate the site and how much compensation will he have to pay the developer?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first part of Senator Macdonald's question goes to the issue of politics and the environment. Let me say this: as far as I am concerned, as the federal environment minister, I have a clear responsibility in this issue to protect the World Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. All my actions, which I have made very clear from day one, have been to that effect. I have an obligation in that regard; I have a responsibility in that regard, and I am meeting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did make clear in my advice to the Queensland environment minister, Molly Robson, what my approach on this development would be. In my letter to Molly Robson of 29 September 1994 I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I must say that I retain a number of concerns about the proposed development. In particular, it appears to me that insufficient environmental assessment has occurred in relation to the proposal. This now manifests itself in the need for a detailed assessment of the baseline state of the environment that will be impacted by the proposed development. It has also led to the situation where studies are proposed concurrently with construction activities, rather than a proper sequential process where the baseline studies, setting of standards and the monitoring program would precede approvals.</PARA>
<PARA>I also indicated in that piece of correspondence what would govern my approach. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should add that if, as a result of this further work, it becomes clear that World Heritage values are likely to be damaged or destroyed through the proposed development, then it will be necessary for it to be amended in such a way as to avoid that damage or destruction. Otherwise I will need to consider invoking the relevant provisions of the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. I would be grateful if you would make that clear to the developer.</PARA>
<PARA>There was, as I indicated during question time yesterday, sufficient advice for me to recommend to the Governor-General that those proclamations be made. I have also indicated&mdash;I have taken a very cautious approach in this matter because I think the precautionary principle is relevant in relation to this particular issue&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Mr Williams said that the whole project has stopped and so has Mr Goss. I invite the minister to answer the question about the cost of rehabilitation and compensation. Also, the minister claims that he has sufficient advice. Mr Goss said on TV last night that he had the minister's evidence investigated by experts, and they rejected it out of hand.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SF4">Senator COONEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister representing the Attorney-General. There have been responsible expressions of concern that the government's racial hatred legislation is too broad in its application. Has the government got in mind any mechanism to ensure that the legislation, if passed, will work so as to avoid an unfair impact in the community?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3232" SPEAKER="Bolkus Sen The Hon N." NAMEID="XE4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="IMMIGRATION AND ETHNIC AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator BOLKUS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Cooney for this very timely question. We are, of course, aware of suggestions that the terms of our legislation are too broad, particularly the suggestions that the legislation goes further than those provisions in respect of racial hatred contained in the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act. I welcome this opportunity Senator Cooney has given me to allay those concerns. There are, indeed, differences between our legislation and the New South Wales legislation. But, of course, we believe ours is better because it reflects some experiences in other jurisdictions within Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth bill is, in fact, a much better embodiment of the basic principles of criminal responsibility. For instance, it specifically requires intention to incite racial hatred. It also requires that there be reasonable likelihood of racial hatred being incited before a person can incur criminal liability. As well as that, the New South Wales act uses the term `serious contempt and severe ridicule of', which arguably extends the application of the offence to a much wider set of circumstances than the racial hatred addressed by section 60 of the Commonwealth bill.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, is not to say that the New South Wales legislation restricts free speech. It is worth referring to the comments of former Liberal senator and President of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board, Chris Puplick, who has said on a number of occasions that he does not believe that either the Commonwealth legislation or the New South Wales legislation restrict free speech.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has also quite recently confirmed that the New South Wales laws are more broad ranging than those proposed by the federal government. I think we should also look to the experience reflected by Mr Puplick when he says that, five years on, racial vilification laws have made New South Wales a better place to live, providing a sound basis for education campaigns, helping to change workplace and institutional attitudes and offering numerous individuals the opportunity to take action against racist behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney is right: there is a need for the government to put to rest the misinformation that is being put out in the community in respect of the government's legislation. It is vitally important, I believe, that all Australians understand the details of our bill and the fact that it protects free speech while closing a gap in the legal protection available to victims of extreme racial behaviour. In that respect, I will be writing in my capacity as Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to all ethnic communities, bringing to their attention the detail of the bill and also bringing to their attention the misinformation that has been perpetrated on the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, it is worth noting the comment of Mr Mark Leibler the other day when he said, `Despite all this misinformation, the fact is that the heads of ethnic communities are not stupid, they have seen through the tactic.' The tactic they have seen through is the tactic of members of the opposition, the tactic that Mr Costello refers to as `narrowcasting'&mdash;narrowcasting being giving one message to ethnic communities, that they support the principle, and one message to the rural constituency, that they do not. As Mr Leibler would say, the heads of ethnic communities are not stupid. They can see through the fact that the opposition probably has no way of getting a bill into the parliament. It has not drafted anything; it has not given us a time frame for legislation. The only strategy it has is that strategy of narrowcasting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line, and it is objectionable in the context of free speech, is that not only have ethnic leaders been misled and verballed but also they have been threatened in a very childish way by the opposition. That is not what we on this side of the parliament refer to as free speech. Healthy interaction is important, particularly on this issue. We want to see Senator Vanstone's bill but we do not believe we will ever get it, nor do those ethnic leaders, because as one leader, Mr Nino Randazzo, said yesterday, `The opposition's behaviour is typical of a person who has no contact whatsoever with ethnic communities. Mr Downer is a man who has never consulted with ethnic communities and will never understand the real meaning of multicultural Australia'. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say it is not of immediacy because, as I understand it, obviously there is no such super league in existence yet. My advice is that in 1995 the premiership will continue along the planned lines involving all 20 rugby league clubs, but the Raiders will still clean them up. It appears it is still to be finalised for the 1996 season, and we cannot be sure whether a super league would be a possibility by then. But I do accept that it may well happen and that the televising of it would be of great significance to many Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it very clear that new competitions, such as any proposed super league, are not exempt from the anti-siphoning provisions of the Broadcasting Services Act.

If the Minister for Communications and the Arts considers that any new rugby league competition, in whatever form it takes, should be included on the anti-siphoning list, he will include it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer the minister to recently reported statements by Sir Julius Chan that BRA leaders and the president of the Bougainville interim government would be `hunted down and brought to bear justice', and reports that the situation in Bougainville has deteriorated to such an extent that the BRA and the BIG are now apparently under threat from what appears to be a mercenary group which includes two Australians. I ask: can the minister provide an update on the current situation in Bougainville, particularly in the light of these reports? Can he comment on any actions the Australian government can take with respect to the two Australian mercenaries who are reported to be involved?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the general situation, it is of course a matter of regret to all of us that the recent Bougainville peace conference did not achieve the permanent and lasting settlement of the conflict that we had been hoping for. That may, in any event, I suppose, have been expecting too much from such an occasion after five years of conflict.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision by the leadership of the hard-core BRA not to attend the peace conference, for all its unfortunate character, did not prevent over a thousand other Bougainvillians from all parts of the island assembling in Arawa under the protection of the South Pacific peacekeeping force and openly sharing their views and aspirations about the situation on the island in a manner which simply has not been possible for years and which has, I think, given a new fillip and momentum to the peace process.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That process has continued since the formal closure of the conference on 14 October in informal discussions which have taken place between the PNG government and various Bougainvillian groups and among Bougainvillian groups themselves. Importantly, the cease-fire has not been broken since the closure of the peace conference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is to be a meeting held, we understand, in Port Moresby next week between the PNG government and 20 Bougainvillean leaders, including some BRA leaders. We have been asked, as a government, to contribute to the cost of holding that meeting and we are prepared to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to Sir Julius Chan's specific comment that Senator Margetts referred to, he did say something to the effect that the BRA leadership who failed to participate would be hunted down, but in subsequent amplification of that comment he has made it clear that this did not imply any extra-legal activity on the part of the authorities but rather simply that the laws of Papua New Guinea would be applied to those who transgressed them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other point made by Senator Margetts about mercenaries and so on, we have got no information which would confirm allegations of a mercenary group operating on Bougainville to attack BRA figures. I would comment that all sorts of allegations have been made to try to shift the blame and win sympathy for the BRA, and I think some of these need to be taken with more than just a grain or two of salt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding is that it would be extremely difficult for any group which was not intimately familiar with the Bougainville terrain and which had no sophisticated logistic support to operate successfully in the way that has been alleged. In the event that Australian citizens were proven to be operating abroad in some mercenary capacity, the provisions of the Crimes (Foreign Incursions and Recruitment) Act would certainly apply.</PARA>

I thank the minister and I do acknowledge that a growing number of people on Bougainville support a peaceful resolution to the long years of conflict, but could Australia's current support of the Papua New Guinea government be seen as an endorsement of the Papua New Guinea Defence Force's final push to forcibly eliminate all opposition on Bougainville?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have argued from the outset that a forcible solution is not likely to be anything like as successful or certainly as satisfactory as a process of peaceful reconciliation through negotiation. That has been our position which we have strongly maintained all the way through. Senator Margetts talks about the PNGDF's final push to forcibly eliminate the BRA. I have just said that the cease-fire has not been broken, to our knowledge, and there is no such final push to forcibly eliminate the PNGDF. The Papua New Guinea government has been trying in recent weeks since the collapse, since the end of the peace conference&mdash;`collapse' is, I think, the wrong word&mdash;to try to develop a momentum for peace through working with those groups and individuals who have demonstrated a willingness to find a peaceful solution. If that can create a situation where more and more pressure is building up on the remnants of the BRA leadership and rebels to in fact peacefully succumb to this process and involve themselves in it, that is an infinitely better outcome than doing it more forcibly. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Devereux for his question and for his and Senator Jones's continuing interest in this area. They have both raised such matters with me on several occasions. China is Australia's fastest growing regional market. One of the obvious reasons for that is the way its economy is growing so rapidly. But there is another&mdash;and from an Australian point of view more important&mdash;reason, which is our growing capacity to meet a broader range of China's needs, particularly in the area of complex manufactures. We continue to supply to China our traditional strengths in agricultural and mineral commodities, but we are adding to it a significant manufacturing export component.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in exports to China is both absolute and relative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At $A1.8 billion, as Senator Devereux said, that is 25 per cent higher than for the same period last year. That is what our figures show and it is similar to what is reflected in the Chinese data which Senator Devereux just referred to. It is especially significant because China's imports overall increased by only 15 per cent over the same period. Our growth was 25 per cent; growth overall was only 15 per cent. So it is growing rapidly in a way that is very positive but is also growing significantly as a proportion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a strong base in our exports to China, in our agricultural commodities and industrial raw materials. But what is significant in terms of jobs for Australians is the extent to which exports in manufactures are expanding. Australia's exports of complex manufactures to China have increased from $82 million in 1990 to $424 million in 1993&mdash;another $340 million worth of exports and a lot of jobs for Australians in factories and offices all around the country producing products for sale to China.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunities are proliferating. The East Asia Analytical Unit of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has just put out a report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tapping into China's transport infrastructure market</EMPHASIS>, which has found that China expects to invest $233 billion in total infrastructure improvements between now and the end of the decade. This is an area into which Australian companies are moving more and more effectively&mdash;not just the construction companies but the design companies and the suppliers of goods and services to the infrastructure market, particularly, for example, in the communications area. So there are enormous opportunities in this rapidly growing market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is where APEC and the related question of negotiations for accession to GATT for China come in. It is about the government working in the region to open up more opportunities for Australians in areas where there is significant growth and where significant production possibilities and market possibilities exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot ensure that the private sector succeeds in winning these opportunities. We can only make it possible. APEC is a significant contribution to our capacity to do that, particularly in China but in the other 16 member countries of APEC as well, as is the negotiation over GATT accession. They are both significant boosts to our efforts to remove barriers to Australian exports and investment in the region. We hope that the Australian private sector will take up the opportunities of this positive environment that is being created, and I am confident that it will.</PARA>

On 15 November Minister Crean&mdash;contradicting the minister here&mdash;in response to a question from Dr David Kemp, admitted it was correct that 10 per cent of couples with dependants are out of work. Who was responsible for misleading the Australian public on this? I would say it is the ALP government. The official government document, the ABS summary, says that in couple families, one or both parties were employed in 90 per cent of families with dependants. This analysis destroys the Prime Minister's weak defence that the figures quoted by the opposition were wrong. The truth is that, in the remaining 10 per cent of families with dependants, nobody is working&mdash;nobody. Tim Fisher was right. Paul Keating, to his shame, was wrong, and so is the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP record on unemployment is poor. The billions it spent on the white paper and its predecessors have produced this outcome for Australia's families. The government's training reforms have been hit for six by Vince FitzGerald and again highlight Labor's poor record on training outcomes. The participation rate continues to drop&mdash;62.9 per cent in October, down almost 0.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To fudge the figures, Labor is redefining unemployment with labour market programs that are hiding unemployment and not generating real work. The mature age allowance is a clear example of hidden unemployment. Small amounts of part-time work are accounted for as redefining unemployment. The unemployment figure is illusory, showing 800,000 people with no jobs. We need to add back in those who have given up, those the government has defined out&mdash;like the mature age allowance&mdash;and those who are underemployed, with only a little work. If we add all these people back in, we would double the official unemployment rate. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

They still think about Australia as a highly protected economy and conduct business as if doing so behind a high tariff wall. That 34 per cent of Australian businesses, mainly small to medium size businesses, need to readjust their thinking or indeed the international economy will overtake them and they will lose their shirt and may even go out of business.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of doing that, we have gone further: we have set up now an electronic directory of business assistance programs and services for small to medium size companies which will be available to banks, accountants and lawyers&mdash;people with whom small business deals in the normal course of its business day&mdash;and which will have on an interactive display the whole gamut of government programs, both state and federal when we complete the negotiations with the states, available for use and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also the government's intention to make that electronic directory available to members of this Senate and to members of the House of Representatives. As a consequence, I have invited all honourable senators, who would have received their invitations, to the launch of BizHelp, as this program is called, tomorrow here in the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have focused in providing business services on the needs of our customers. We as a government define the needs of our customers, the many thousands of small to medium size businesses in Australia, and have brought together all government services to make it easy for them to access those business services. The BizHelp program is a major step forward in decentralising from government institutions that support network and the information necessary to help small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why it will be available to banks, accountants and lawyers is that small business people deal with those authorities in the course of their normal business day and often rely on them for advice about how to conduct their business. Therefore, it enables the lending officers of banks, accountants and lawyers to consult the full directory of government services, too, when advising and counselling small or medium size businesses about opportunities to find services that will help them grow and be more competitive. Because small businesses also consult members of parliament, I think it is entirely appropriate that members of parliament should have this electronic directory and assist small to medium size businesses in Australia when the opportunity to do so arises.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, Senator Herron asked me a question about haemophilia. I have some further information which is additional to the answer that was given to him in writing earlier. The government acknowledges an obligation to ensure that sufficient Factor VIII is available for emergency treatment. The government is monitoring, and will continue to monitor, the situation closely.

In January 1995 there will be 12,000 vials available and that will considerably exceed the average availability. In the short term, though, the government will import recombinant Factor VIII at short notice should lives be at risk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government acknowledges that there is a long-term problem of enabling sufficient supplies of Factor VIII for the desirable level of prophylactic treatment and for elective surgery, as is illustrated by the circumstances mentioned in Senator Herron's question yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is normally the process that applies in the chamber, so I did not have the opportunity to hear any of Senator Ian Macdonald's contribution. Firstly, I emphasise that I have not stopped this development. The effect of the proclamation is only to make illegal any activities which adversely affect the World Heritage values in the prescribed area. This has been made very clear to the developer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern with the development has always been the possible impact on the World Heritage values of the Hinchinbrook Channel, including the impact on seagrass beds. That is why my department commissioned a report by Mr Peter Valentine. The World Heritage nomination for the Great Barrier Reef prepared in 1980 specifically refers to the importance of seagrasses. It recognises that they are an important food source for grazing animals such as fish, turtles and dugong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Valentine report identified possible impacts from the Oyster Point development on seagrass beds as an issue of major concern. In particular, the report raised significant concerns about the impact of mangrove clearing on turbidity levels in the channel which `could further compromise the survival of seagrass beds and associated fauna'. Valentine recognised, however, that there was insufficient environmental information to pass judgment on the likelihood and extent of possible negative impacts on World Heritage values. This included a lack of information about the distribution and abundance of seagrasses in the vicinity of the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Valentine recommended that a series of baseline studies of the area should be undertaken as a prerequisite to future action. The baseline study on the distribution of seagrasses at Oyster Point done by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries has filled some critical information gaps. The complete report, as I have said, was made available to my department on 14 November; an incomplete copy was faxed on 9 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPI report confirms the presence of extensive seagrass beds, including the relatively rare species, halophila tricostata, which it says is a rare, little-studied species which should be protected. According to the report, the seagrass beds contribute a significant resource to the Hinchinbrook Channel. It points out that almost all seagrasses between Cairns and Townsville occur in areas which are `under some threat'. It recognises that the level of water turbidity can have a major impact on the survival of seagrasses. Importantly, the DPI report concludes as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Near-shore seagrass habitats, such as those at Oyster Point and adjacent to Cardwell, are important to marine ecology, to dugong and turtle populations and to the commercial prawn fishery. These habitats are only a small part of the total coastal zone and any losses need to be avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>The effect of this report was therefore to increase the need for an extremely cautious approach in respect of any activity which may affect the seagrass beds. The information in the DPI report reinforced Valentine's concerns about the impact of mangrove clearing and made my department look very closely at his recommendation that the proposal be further reviewed in an attempt to reduce mangrove losses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to receiving this report, my department was provided with other scientific assessments which indicated that the clearing of strand mangroves was likely to cause significant turbidity and therefore have a significant adverse impact on the seagrass beds. My department also became concerned about the manner in which the mangroves were being removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the combined effect of these accumulating scientific assessments, including, importantly, the DPI report and concern about the manner of clearance, that led my department to recommend that action be taken to halt the mangrove clearance. I should point out also that I am continuing to receive many representations from marine scientists who are extremely concerned about likely impacts on the channel. Those representations include the letter that Senator Reynolds has referred to. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Before the minister goes, I say to her that one of her own ministers, Minister Crean, also confirmed on 15 November that the 10 per cent figure is quite correct.

Why do these people not work full time? Because the economic policies of this government have demolished so much work in this country and have not been able to replace it with new industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I want to indicate my traditional opposition to the type of motion that we are confronted with every time a year is coming to its end, or a series of sittings of this kind is coming to an end. I know there has been a considerable blow-out in the time that has been utilised by the Senate in respect of a number of pieces of legislation. That included, of course, the land fund legislation, which occupied the time of this chamber to the extent of nearly 28 hours&mdash;quite a considerable period. As is the case with much of the legislation that is considered by this chamber, that was very vital legislation. I understand the government's problem. Nevertheless, I believe there is a need to reflect upon not only the damage that is done to the health of individual senators by sitting late and constantly, as is proposed by this motion, but also the effect that that has on the mature consideration of legislation that comes before this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know about other senators but, after getting here at half past six or 7 o'clock in the morning and working right through until 10.30 p.m. and the adjournment debate, I get to the point where I cannot focus on the details of the legislation, and that is a problem. It is certainly a problem for me, because I have to focus on each and every piece of legislation that comes into the chamber. I do not have the advantage of being in a party where general policy decisions are made and then a spokesperson is trusted to look after those matters. From then on, party members do not need to have much of an input or give much consideration to the legislation. I acknowledge also that honourable senators have committee work to be done, which is time consuming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this applies to all senators, not only to me. As far as possible, motions for extension of time should be avoided.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The opposition has not opposed the motion for an extension of time, but I want to tell the Senate how very disappointed we were that such a motion became necessary this year. With the new structure of starting earlier in the year and having three sitting periods, we believed that this would not happen and would not be necessary. It certainly comes as a considerable inconvenience to a lot of people to find that this is the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believed, perhaps foolishly, that the government was planing a new approach to legislation and that the legislation would be fitted into the times that we were presented with earlier in the year. At the beginning of the session, very little work was scheduled on the program&mdash;there was very little to be done. It is all very well for senators to talk about how few bills were passed. Very few bills were put before the Senate and other matters were dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions, we gave up MPIs and general business. This was done earlier in the session than would normally happen to keep the program running up-to-date. We are now faced with the alternative of sitting for an extra week or putting in the time in the two weeks that this motion refers to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we are not opposing the motion. We have cooperated with the government in working out a program. I recognise that the government has removed 18 bills from the program. The fact that the government needed to remove 18 bills to allow the balance of the program to be met within the two-week period only exacerbates the point: the program was in disorder. We are extremely disappointed at what has occurred again this year.</PARA>

<PARA>Auditor-General's report No. 9 of 1994-95 is a very serious report. I regret that time pressures limit the things that should be said about this report. I hope that the matter will be dealt with at another time, perhaps at some greater length. For the moment, I will deal briefly with the potential for disasters and inadequate responses available that the Auditor-General finds exist as a result of the carriage of large volumes of oil around Australia. The Auditor-General says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for large economic and environmental loss from a major oil spill in Australia's marine environment is significant. The consequences of a major spill were clearly illustrated by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Exxon Valdez</EMPHASIS> incident in Alaska in 1989 when 36 000 tonnes were spilled. The Australian public's attention was drawn to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> incident off the coast of Western Australia in 1991 when the tanker's bow fell off. A total of 17 900 tonnes of oil spilt into the sea during the incident.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 22 million tonnes of oil is shipped in Australian waters each year as tanker cargo. All forms of shipping make over 26 000 port visits each year. Many ships pass through or near delicate marine environments such as the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>
<PARA>I briefly outline that because the Auditor-General asserts, and I understand with some strong support, that the technology currently available is such that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is no certainty that a major oil spill can be dispersed before it impacts on the shoreline . . . the ANAO believes that there is scope for improving oil spill response arrangements and the assessment of equipment requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It believes also that AMSA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the organisation responsible for trying to do something about these problems&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should encourage the States, Northern Territory and industry to assume greater responsibility for response operations, equipment storage and personnel training.</PARA>
<PARA>According to the Auditor-General, as the technology does not exist to prevent major oil slicks washing ashore in adverse weather the fact is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The best that can typically be expected after a major spill is to recover 10% of the oil. The rest may well pollute the shoreline. In Australia, the Commonwealth, States, Northern Territory and industry combine their efforts through the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil.</PARA>
<PARA>But this plan is clearly enormously inadequate and, in fact, the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report on disaster management in June of this year said that, while the AMSA is well skilled in operational maritime matters, it needs assistance to develop and maintain the plan and integrate industry research with the plan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Auditor-General, serious weaknesses exist which should be addressed. These are briefly: there are no quantifiable targets to use as the basis of decisions about the location and amount of equipment required to combat a spill; there is a lack of designated offshore storage containers in local equipment stockpiles for use in transporting recovered oil; there are lower levels of response equipment than is required in some high risk areas in northern Australia, particularly chemical dispersant; the national plan response arrangements have not been adequately tested in scenario planning at major disaster level; and there is no representation of the salvage industry, coastal local government councils, and commercial, recreational and environmental groups on the National Plan Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious Auditor-General's report. There is much more of moment in this report that should be referred to the Senate but, in view of time pressures, I will leave it at that. I think Senator Margetts wishes to make some remarks on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to back up the remarks of Senator Michael Baume on this particular matter. One would have to say that, as we have not been able to adequately test the response arrangements for major disasters, it is more by good luck than good management in some respects that both the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko Harvest</EMPHASIS> were lesser disasters than it was felt they could have been by a number of coastal communities in Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume mentioned the weaknesses that have been pointed out in this audit report, and I would like to speak briefly about some of these and how they relate to Western Australia and other parts of Australia. First of all, there are no quantifiable targets to use as the basis of decisions about the location and amount of equipment required to combat a spill. That means simply that it should be possible for AMSA to say, `Our target is, within one day or two days, to have all of the equipment that might be necessary to deal with a major spill at whichever coastal location is closest to the major spill or most able to be serviced.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that we have a huge coastline and not all of it is accessible easily by aircraft. Therefore, we may have to factor into that a fair amount of road travel. That is very important when we are talking about adequate responses. If at no stage do we have a target set, the ability of different communities to work in with a plan to make sure that their area can cope with a major spill for their particular circumstances is going to be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a lack of designated offshore storage containers of local equipment stockpiles. Whilst there are a number of points throughout Australia which have major stockpiles that can be brought into use, it is necessary, I believe, to have start-off equipment, that is, equipment that we can use as a first-aid measure for oil spills. If we do not have those adequately covered throughout Australia offshore then our ability to deal in the first instance is going to be very much reduced, obviously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have lower levels of response equipment than is required in some high risk areas in northern Australia, particularly chemical dispersants. We are dealing with areas where we might, as Senator Baume mentioned, be threatening an entire reef ecosystem, and it could also include an entire breeding area for major industries such as the prawning industry and the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not have the levels of response equipment that is required in those kinds of areas and those kinds of circumstances, our ability to respond in any case is going to be minimised. As I said, the fact that we have not had a major disaster in a way is good but it also means that we have had no means of finding out whether our responses work. This requires coordination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point is that because there is no representation of the salvage industry, many people have felt that the salvage companies have not had a lot of power of decision making in these kinds of crises. So when these tugs attach themselves to these ships, then their ability to know what the plan is and what action should be taken is limited if there has not been cooperation with the salvage companies in putting together these kinds of plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have also found in Western Australia is that local governments, certainly, but also local communities that have felt deeply the possible threat of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Kirki</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sanko</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Harvest</EMPHASIS> have got together quite a lot of local information about wind dispersal, tidal dispersal, their local ecosystem, and the possible impacts such a spill would have on their local economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we can utilise that kind of good quality local information that has been built up over the years, then we are not making the best use of the possible resources that are available to deal with these kinds of issues. There are a number of recommendations that come from these. In fact, there are seven. The audit office has recommended that AMSA define its role as manager of the national plan. That does not mean that it does it all. It often means that the states take a greater role. It simply means that there is a coordinating body to make sure that all those things fit into place and everybody knows what role it plays. It does not mean the federal body taking over the role of the states. It just means making sure that someone does it and perhaps the people who are best able to do it have that role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recommended that AMSA consider adopting a more strategic leadership role overseeing the states and Northern Territory, as I mentioned. It is recommended that it review the risks associated with the possible introduction of very large tankers. I think that risk also obviously has to include the type of shipping and the standard of shipping that we are getting. It is recommended that it clarify current planning assumptions regarding the design spill size and establish a benchmark of the national planned capability; that it quantify oil spill response planning standards, define equipment requirements to meet these standards and re-examine the distribution. If it provides these standards, then people know what they can expect. It also might know if things are going wrong, if things happen within a certain time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is recommended that it should consider a regional alliance between Australia and its northern neighbours covering oil spill prevention and response matters, thus improving protection to northern Australia&mdash;that only seems sensible&mdash;and consider establishing a national response team of specially trained operators available on request to respond quickly and expertly, regardless of jurisdictional boundaries. It seems reasonable. We are not going to have those people having a full time job all around Australia, but if we had a response team that can be called in at particular times of crisis, then it would obviously be very helpful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have heard me talk on a number of occasions about the concept and the problems of oil pollution. I want to tie this in with the fact that the term of reference for this inquiry was obviously to look at the ability to cope with a major oil spill. But perhaps more important than that is our ability to prevent such things. When we see things like the AMSA report, which tells us that that body has fewer staff and is having to deal with more ships, we realise that the ability to deal with and properly examine those ships is reduced. Because AMSA is dealing with more ships, its productivity might seem to be going up; but its ability to more properly deal with ships that might possibly be at risk is limited by staffing and resourcing arrangements. It is then that this kind of inadequacy becomes more and more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important, I believe, to fully state that the possible liability should not be borne only by the environment and the communities affected. Obviously, the shipping companies have a great liability, but it is not just theirs, either. Those individuals and sectors in our community which wish to benefit from the cheaper rates of substandard and flag of convenience shipping must, in my opinion, also share some of the liability if such an accident takes place because of substandard shipping, training or staffing levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my opinion that, unless we deal with the liability regime in relation to the shipping industry in general and the oil industry in particular in Australia, we will have an even greater dependence on the kind of response we get. Of course, responses should be only the last resort. We should be making sure that we have less and less risk that these things will ever happen. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, I rise today to table a report prepared for the committee by the former Comptroller-General of Customs, Mr Frank Kelly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tabling Mr Kelly's report I should make it clear that the committee stands by the principal finding in Report 325 that there were serious deficiencies in the management and operation of the Australian Customs Service at the time of the Midford Paramount case. These deficiencies were also noted in the report of the Conroy review of the Customs Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Kelly's report has been prepared in response to recommendation 91 in the committee's Report No. 325, which was entitled The Midford Paramount Case and Related Matters. This recommendation called on the Comptroller-General to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">review the levels, functions and suitability of the Australian Customs Service officers involved in the Midford case, together with the lines of responsibility and supervision, that were clearly inadequate according to the evidence before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Kelly's report was provided to the committee on 14 June 1994, under the cover of a letter from Mr Kelly's successor as Comptroller-General, Mr Lionel Woodward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall finding in Mr Kelly's report is that although the performance of a number of Customs officers involved in the Midford case was flawed, `there is no evidence to support a case of fraud, dishonesty or illegal behaviour by any officer, and no basis has been found for the laying of any criminal charges' (I refer here to paragraph 153 of Mr Kelly's report).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, Mr Kelly concludes that `in no case have I considered it to be appropriate that disciplinary action should be taken against any officer still in the Service' (I refer here to paragraph 155 of Mr Kelly's report).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the committee has thought long and hard about whether or not to table Mr Kelly's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering the matter we have met with Mr Woodward and sought and considered the views of all of the 15 people named in Mr Kelly's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there are arguments to the contrary, the committee has decided to the table the report in its entirety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has come to this decision for two reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, because the inquiry which began this matter, the committee's inquiry into the Midford Paramount case, was a public inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, because of the strong representations made to us by most of the individuals named in the report, who believe that the tabling of the report provides them with an opportunity to clear their names.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another relevant consideration was advice the committee received from Mr Woodward that, on the basis of the information he has considered about the Midford case and the roles of the respective officers, he will not be taking any prosecution or disciplinary action against any officer named in Mr Kelly's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I know that the Midford case and the subsequent reviews have been a difficult and unpleasant experience for some staff within the Customs Service. To these people I say, on behalf of the committee, that I note both Mr Kelly's conclusions and Mr Woodward's advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have been pleased to see that since the tabling of the committee's report and the release of the Conroy Review, significant steps have been taken to improve management, accountability and reporting systems within Customs. There are clear signs that lessons are being learned from the mistakes of the past.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee's thirteenth report of 1994 deals with the proposed upgrading of accommodation at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>, NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>, located on Sydney Harbour, is a major Naval training establishment which carries out specialist warfare and navigation training for naval personnel. Most of the buildings were built in the 1950s.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal examined by the committee involves the provision of new or upgraded living-in accommodation for 346 Service personnel, additional office space and classrooms, improved recreation facilities and additional parking space.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee has recommended that the proposal should proceed at an estimated out-turn cost of $18.81 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After having inspected existing facilities at the base the committee was convinced that if HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> is to remain as a major training establishment for the Navy, the standard of accommodation available for personnel must be improved, and shortfalls in the amount of accommodation available must be rectified. This applies to recreation and dining facilities as well, especially for junior and senior sailors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee noted that some investment in training facilities has been made at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> in recent years and saw two excellent new training facilities during the inspection of the base.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless a number of other essential training facilities are spread out, lack adequate space and should be upgraded or replaced to enable HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> to continue its role as a major naval training establishment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the inspection of the base the committee saw that the boundary of the Sydney Harbour National Park, which surrounds the base on three sides, has considerable exotic vegetation which Defence has offered to restore to more natural bushland. The committee has recommended that Defence should press the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service to accept the Defence offer to assist with the restoration of bushland in areas near the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary, which is currently in a poor state, adjacent to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the public hearing a number of community groups expressed concern about the master planning of the base and the apparent visual intrusiveness of a number of new buildings which will be constructed. The committee has taken these concerns on board and has recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, a consultative committee should be established to provide a forum for the exchange of views on planning and management matters affecting HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> and the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, that a number adjustments to various layouts and designs should be made, including the distance of the proposed junior officers' accommodation from the Sydney Harbour National Park boundary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the committee has suggested that for future projects, baseline planning documents such as master plans should be prepared well in advance of proposals being referred to the committee. This will enable local planning authorities and community groups to provide comment and to be advised of general planning objectives well before specific work takes place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, the overall scope of the upgrading of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Watson</EMPHASIS> will be adequate to cater for known future requirements as Defence does not believe it will be necessary to undertake further development work at HMAS<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Watson</EMPHASIS> for some time.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will recall that earlier this week after extensive debate the Senate rejected an attempt by the government to amend the order of the Senate of June of this year which required each minister to table an indexed list of file titles in respect of each department he or she administered. The relevant files were to include files relating to policy advising functions of the department, including any relating to the development of legislation, and other matters of public administration. There were some exceptions, but the fact is that this week the Senate rejected the attempt by the government to place the limit that it sought on that order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate then decided that the Finance and Public Administration References Committee would oversight the operation of that order. This particular reference is quite different from the reference that was given to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration in June. That committee considered the matter, asked for submissions from the government and met in private session. The chair of that committee admitted in the debate earlier this week that, so far as he was concerned, he believed the Senate did not have the right to have ministers table the indexed file list of policy advising files. The Senate clearly rejected that view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems with the previous reference was that the committee met in private; it did not have public hearings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, I want to continue the remarks that I have been making over a period of time about the protection of whistleblowers, particularly in my home state. In order to save the time of the Senate, rather than read a letter into the record, I would seek leave to table it. It has been distributed to both the government and the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To turn to another matter, on Monday night, 14 November, I voiced concerns in the Senate about the treatment suffered by those people who were trying to protect the mangroves at Oyster Point from destruction. During that speech I stated that members of the coastguard were involved in supporting the removal of these protesters. I have since ascertained that this information is incorrect. I wish to apologise unreservedly to members of the coastguard for any offence caused by my statements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about Telecom, about accountability and about the unwarranted rejection of yet another Australian small business in favour of a foreign supplier. RF Devices is an Australian manufacturer of microcells&mdash;a device to site a mobile telephone system at a distance from the transmitter using fibre optic technology. The RF Devices product is called `Lightcell'. RF Devices has a good track record of competent product delivery. RF Devices has been trying to sell its product to Telecom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only competitor product for Lightcell is an American product. My information is that Lightcell offers Australia a range of advantages over the American product, and they are: technical superiority; significantly cheaper&mdash;of the order of 40 per cent; better local technical support; local stocks of replacement parts; and a longer warranty. Normally, one would think that would be enough to win a tender. But, in addition, Lightcell is designed and made in Australia; it provides local employment; it replaces imports; and it is a product with export potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and Telecom both claim to have a policy of supporting Australian industry development through their purchasing policies. Nevertheless, in June this year, RF Devices approached me and told me that it had information that, no matter how much better its product was, Telecom would buy from the Americans because of the views of a particular Telecom purchasing officer. RF Devices felt that, even if it offered its product for free, Telecom would still buy from the Americans. I am sad to say that events appeared to have proved RF Devices right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took the matter up with the Minister for Communications, Mr Lee, and asked him to intervene. We asked him to ask the identified purchasing officer to stand aside just for this one tender&mdash;not because we had convicted him without a trial, as people might claim, but because it is important that purchasing by government business enterprises is not only fair, but is also seen to be fair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister told us that he cannot intervene in the commercial operations of Telecom. Just think about that, Madam Acting Deputy President. The Australian taxpayer is the 100 per cent owner of Telecom, but does not have any say in ensuring that Telecom operates in a fair and proper manner in expending taxpayer money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also asked if we could, in confidence, have a look at tender assessment documentation. Again, we were told this could not to be done. Apparently, there is no way to hold Telecom accountable for how it spends government money. The minister passed on our concerns to Telecom, and I acknowledge that gratefully. Essentially, however, we have been told that Telecom was asked whether it was going to be fair and Telecom replied that it would be. That is the extent to which the public can get assurance: Telecom telling us it is being fair. So we, I guess, have to believe it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RF Devices, despite its misgivings about whether it would get a fair go, went to the time, trouble and expense of preparing an excellent tender for Telecom's latest requirement for 50 units of the microcell product. This week it was told by Telecom that its tender was by far the lowest priced tender. Telecom has not told RF Devices of any deficiencies in its product. However, Telecom offered RF Devices only five of the 50 units&mdash;10 per cent of the available order. The remaining 45 units were to go to the more expensive and&mdash;it is claimed&mdash;technically inferior American product. No reason, however, was given. Five units is not a sufficient order to be economic. We suspect that it is a sop to keep RF Devices quiet. Telecom also vaguely spoke about developing future business. Another sop. It is known that this is the last tender for this type of product that Telecom will be putting out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a matter of great concern. Here we have a government and business enterprises&mdash;both government and private&mdash;saying that we must create employment in Australia, that we must buy Australian and that we must support local industries. Yet here we have a government business enterprise giving preference to</PARA>
<PARA>a foreign company, when all the evidence appears to suggest that the Australian company should have got the order. I expect, having put this on the public record, that either we will see a change in the attitude of Telecom and a reversal of the procedure it has adopted and the way in which it has placed this order&mdash;even on this particular order&mdash;or we will get an explanation from both Telecom and the minister as to why this particular destructive course of action is being followed. </PARA>
