<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 30 May 1994 concerning the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Regulations, Statutory Rules 1994 No 126, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 2 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Regulations were made to facilitate implementation by Australia of the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage, 1971.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When that Convention enters into force for Australia (not likely to be prior to 1 November 1994), oil companies operating in Australia will be required to complete, on an annual basis, a return that includes details of oil received by ship. The information provided must be certified by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) on behalf of the Australian Government in order to fulfil the obligations under Article 15 of the Convention to provide relevant data to the Fund established under the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information provided by the oil companies and certified by AMSA will determine the contribution due from each company to The Fund. Regulation 24 is designed to enable AMSA to confirm that the information provided by an oil company is correct.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In practice, it is expected that the provision would need to be enforced rarely as the Australian industry has indicated full support of the Convention and the procedures necessary to ensure compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's concern is noted and I have asked the Department of Transport to seek advice from the AttorneyGeneral's Department on this matter. I will be in a position to respond to your Committee's concern once that advice has been received. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his response, the Minister for Transport, the Honourable Laurie Brereton MP, undertook to have his Department seek the advice of the Attorney-General's Department and to respond to the Committee when that advice had been received.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice of the Attorney-General's Department has now been received and I have attached a copy of the advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You will note that the Attorney-General's Department is of the view that regulation 24 of the Regulations does not involve self-incrimination but merely requires a return for administrative purposes, no different to that required under many other legislative schemes. The imposition of the penalty for not complying with a request to provide a return is not connected to the liability to contribute to the Fund. It relates solely to the failure to provide information required for proper administration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on the implications of Australian defence exports commenced on 9 September 1993. At that time the then Minister for Trade, Senator Peter Cook, referred the matter to the committee and outlined certain terms of reference for the committee's deliberations, including the definition as to what goods and services might constitute defence exports&mdash;traditionally, this has been something of a grey area; the guidelines, constraints and conditions governing Australian defence exports; the actual role of existing programs in facilitating defence exports; and to also look in a comprehensive way at the strategic, political, economic, international and human rights implications of defence exports and Australia's role in the construction of an effective international regime of monitoring and reporting on defence exports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was a series of issues, therefore, that had very serious moral, political, economic, industrial and strategic dimensions and considerations grouped around the terms of reference. There is no question that it was a legitimate area of inquiry, and legitimate concerns were expressed to the committee as to the appropriate Australian industrial posture and profile, as to our role internationally and as to the guidelines which might govern the defence export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that has been drafted by the trade subcommittee&mdash;it was submitted to the House of Representatives a day or so ago and is before the Senate this morning&mdash;is, in my view, a balanced, thoughtful and deliberate report in terms of its review. It deals with very sensitive areas. I think every member of the committee is aware of the significance of human rights concerns. Certainly, the potential for linkage of defence exports with human rights issues and the potential for human rights abuses is clear and was one of the issues that was weighed up by the trade subcommittee in its evaluation. The legitimate demands of self-defence, of the right to protect sovereignty and of rights to guarantee security and independence were also weighed up by the trade subcommittee and by the joint committee as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I think it is appropriate to acknowledge the much hard work done by the chairs of the trade subcommittee, Messrs Kerin and Duffy&mdash;I think Senator Brownhill would be only too pleased to acknowledge that&mdash;and by the committee secretariat staff, particularly Jane Vincent, Bev Forbes and Annette Fischer, in the preparation of the report. It was an outstanding effort over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that the end of the Cold War brought with it a great range of opportunities for humanity. Not all of those opportunities have so far assumed a definite form. Some remain only potential. The strategic environment has unquestionably changed in some respects, as in relations in Europe there is now greater predictability and greater certainty. But in other parts of the world there is greater volatility, less certainty and, as the report makes clear, greater fluidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the collapse of the Soviet empire, for example, and related matters mean there is a vastly increased potential for cheap and easy supplies of arms that are now surplus to the Cold War period and the Cold War doctrines. We confront&mdash;in Africa especially, but not confined to that continent&mdash;circumstances where states simply implode, where the rule of order, as distinct from the rule of law, simply evaporates. We have seen the tragic consequences of those implosions in situations of recent times, such as Somalia and Rwanda. In both of those circumstances Australia has sought to play a very purposeful role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen in different parts of the globe much more brutal conflicts than we have witnessed for a long time. Not since Vietnam have we seen conflicts of the savagery of Bosnia, or the impact of unrestricted arms trafficking upon circumstances whereby civilian populations suffer very greatly. Also, as everyone is aware, there is a greater potential, an increased potential, as a consequence of the end of the Cold War, in certain circumstances, for massive destruction to loom. I refer to the potentially disastrous adversarial situations that have loomed in recent times in the gulf and on the Korean peninsula. In these situations, with more arms being available and greater volatility, the committee looked very carefully at an appropriate Australian role. The deliberations of the committee very much reflected Australian opinion in the broad. A diversity of opinion was present not only on the committee but also in terms of the submissions received and the arguments advanced and considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International relations now are characterised in our region to an extent and globally by a degree of turbulence and disorder. That requires greater sensitivity in terms of what we do by way of defence exports&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;in terms of the changing security environment and the changing demands upon us for a greater degree of accountability and a greater degree of control. Just to put matters into brief perspective, Australia, of course, is a relatively small defence exporter. The total value of Australian exports of defence and related goods, for example, in 1992-93 approached $37 million. Even allowing for some distortion or some lack of clarity because of the deficiencies in defence export data, it represents a minor part of total Australian exports, as the Senate would be aware. As a matter of fact, defence exports represent something less than one per cent of Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactures which, in turn, represents about 14 per cent of Australia's exports of goods as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By contrast, the Australian Defence Force, the ADF, actually imported about $1.5 billion of defence equipment in 1992-93. I think those figures are interesting in terms of putting matters in balance. There is no question, though, that even given the relatively small size of defence exports, these issues need to be placed under close scrutiny, given the potential impact. The committee in its report endeavoured to outline issues such as the operations of the guidelines for export, including industry concerns regarding the processing time for export approvals, the role of customs in verification procedures, the defence export program, the implications of defence exports and, of course, Australia's international role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the definitions, the committee was of the view that there needs to be greater clarity regarding what we mean by defence exports by the defence industry. In terms of that approach, there is no doubt that the committee's recommendations are entirely appropriate and will lead to a better regime overall. The committee was of the belief that there was a pressing need to develop a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports. The deficiencies in the current definition are most clearly seen when it is endeavoured to apply the definition to estimate the value of defence exports. This is where conflict arises; this is where differing figures emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, there are clear deficiencies in the collection of data. More needs to be done in this regard. Data on defence services, for example, which are now emerging as another area in which there is some degree of growth and potential, is not adequately captured or retrieved in the export definition and in the figures for exports of defence goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actual exports may be greater than the current official data suggests, so we need a better definition, better focus and greater clarity in those areas. In terms of the overall guidelines that apply, there was agreement on the committee as well that these need to be reviewed periodically and that their operation ought to be the subject of a performance audit by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that a number of senators spoke a little earlier in the week on these matters. For example, I note that Senator Bourne spoke about the sensitivity of the area that was under investigation and of the implications of Australian defence exports. In the House of Representatives both Mr Gibson and Mr Langmore made some comments, and in large measure I can appreciate the concerns that they raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the application of the report overall, in an area where there had been little work done by the parliament it has proved to be a valuable document by way of stimulating public discussion and comment and will prove to be valuable in view of the recommendations being adopted. The committee was concerned at the number of difficulties that had been experienced. It was made clear that in a limited number of cases there had been some embarrassing failures. But the committee noted also that significant improvements had been made to the guidelines for approval of defence exports so that such issues as global and regional stability and potential economic, industrial, employment and technological benefits would be taken into consideration; Australia's strategic international relations would be weighed in terms of the decisions made; and the country's commercial credibility would be taken into account when matters were being considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many submissions to the inquiry suggested that the decision making process needs to formally take account of foreign policy objectives, including human rights, as I have mentioned earlier. There is a clear recommendation in the report for a greater degree of cooperation, better communication and closer consultation between the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on these matters. I think that is one of the key findings of the report: that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade needs to have a more formal role in the process, and there is a specific technical recommendation to facilitate that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the committee's report outlines that a defence exports effort within very clear and very firm guidelines is justified and that it can be achieved effectively without compromising foreign policy objectives and without compromising regional security. In fact, quite the contrary; it may be a very useful element in strengthening regional security and stability. However, some improvement to the approvals system is required to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, could I again commend the trade subcommittee of the joint committee for its work in the area. It has broken some new ground and it has definitely stimulated a greater degree of awareness in the broad, and a better focus and a greater degree of certainty in terms of the discussion and debate. The series of recommendations made, 1 through 20, are realistic and appropriate, in my view, and are capable of ready implementation; will serve to improve the regime; and will bring greater clarity to the area and a greater degree of public confidence as to what Australia is able to achieve in what is a highly sensitive area of policy making. </PARA>

Those two gentlemen have made a great contribution to the bringing down of this report. I agree with the sentiments expressed by Senator Loosley in congratulating them on the job they have done in chairing the committee. I also congratulate Beverly Forbes and Jane Vincent and the other members of the secretariat for the hard work that they have put in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received 36 high quality submissions, representing a broad range of interests, and we took evidence from 44 witnesses at hearings in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne. Among the recommendations made in the report, the committee highlights the need for matters of national and regional security to be of primary consideration when decisions regarding defence exports are taken. The minority report criticised the current policy of defence exports, saying that selling defence equipment in Asia fuels regional insecurity and promotes infringements on human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I disagree with that point of view. Australia has always taken, and with this report will continue to take, a well-informed and balanced approach to exporting defence related goods and services. This is an issue which requires balance, and I think the guidelines that are in place for determining whether an export licence is granted reflect that need for balance. The points that have to be taken into account before granting an export licence include the implications for global and regional stability; the potential economic, industrial, employment and technological benefits that the specific export may have for Australia; and the impact on our regional and strategic relations and for our commercial credibility if we deny a country access to our defence goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of this approach is the recent interest shown by Taiwan in buying up to six submarines from Australia&mdash;a deal which was worth about $3 billion. Despite the obvious economic benefits to Australia, it is unlikely the sale will go ahead as it would breach our current policies with China which ban all official ties with Taipei, including the sale of lethal weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report reinforces the constant need to balance our export control with export facilitation. It recommends that the guidelines be kept under continuous review with the changing economic and political realities of our region and of the world. It is ever-changing. We have had moves away from the Cold War and we now have little fracas going on in different places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking realistically at the impact of Australia's exports on regional stability, it is clear that we are a very  small player, especially when one looks at the hardware that is now becoming available within the superpowers following the end of the Cold War and the scaling down of armaments. Therefore, it can be said that the impact of Australia's involvement on a global scale is minimal. On the other hand, the benefits to Australia on a domestic level are great. The development of a specialised technology has far-reaching advantages for Australia's elaborately transformed manufactures, an industry which must be maintained and developed if we are to keep up with the technological advances of the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the obvious financial and development benefits, this report has also emphasised other advantages for encouraging the continuation and expansion of the export of defence related goods. These include the enhancement of Australia's strategic interests through regional engagement and trade negotiations. Through market development and trade in defence exports with our close neighbours, we can build a trust&mdash;which is very important&mdash;and an understanding within the South-East Asian region. Furthermore, the continued development of our industries in this area promotes our own self-reliance&mdash;a goal which Australia would dearly like to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to highlighting what I believe is one of the most important recommendations in the report, and that is the development of a comprehensive description of both defence industry and defence exports. It is important to realise that computer hardware, clothing and mechanical components can all be used in a military capacity and are therefore seen as defence goods. But the use of these types of items can be seen to be of great value to our trading partners outside the defence area. Because our neighbours lack the technological and manufacturing advantage that Australia has developed, they must turn to us and that can only be a good thing for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exporting weapons and defence products will always require balance. If this balance is constantly maintained, Australia will continue to reap the economic and regional benefits of exporting our superior technology and goods. With the total value&mdash;I think Senator Loosley made mention of this earlier&mdash;of Australian exports of defence and related goods in 1992-93 at some $36.8 million, the benefits are very clear for us to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence exports can help our own manufacturing base and our own self-reliance in defence equipment. If we do not export to good neighbours on the proper criteria set out, then someone else will and Australia will be the loser, as the export income and the good relations which come with those exports will be lost to us.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994 covers a wide range of amendments to taxation legislation. It covers areas such as the reportable payments system; foreign investment funds and controlled foreign companies; regional headquarters income tax concessions; and social security payments. These, of course, will be dealt with in detail at the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to focus on the aspect of the legislation to which I alluded last night&mdash;the aspect which affects most workers. As a result of this legislation, the wages of many workers will, in fact, be cut by $28.40 a week. That will come as a great surprise to many workers who did not realise before the last election that the government's promise to provide $30 a week in home child-care allowance was conditional upon the money being taken away from the spouse; that is to say, the dependent spouse rebate would be abolished. That was not understood prior to the last election and, I believe, is still not readily understood by a lot of workers. So it will come as a surprise to them that their wages will, in effect, be cut by $28.40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government argues that a number of carers do not receive the benefit of the dependent spouse rebate, that it goes into the hip pocket of the worker who, in most instances, is the male, while the mother cares for the children. The government also advanced the argument that a number of people were not receiving the dependent spouse rebate because they did not receive sufficient taxable income. That was also an important question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I am concerned that this transfer from the hip pocket into the purse may well result in the same problems that arose from a similar transfer that occurred in 1976 in respect of the family allowance payments. At that time the taxation system handled tax rebates for dependent children. That was abolished and those rebates were cashed up into the family allowance system&mdash;in other words, it was a straight transfer from the hip pocket to the purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that time, successive governments have purloined from the purses of mothers something like $12 billion, and this is what worries me about the exercise that is now before us. As I said last night, if the government were concerned about the need to have the money actually go into the hands of the carer, then it could have done so by simply requiring the spouse, whether it be male or female, who was actually working to provide a certificate which showed that the money would be transferred to the bank account of the carer. That would have been a simple way of doing that. The other area in respect of those who are not receiving a sufficient income to benefit from the dependent spouse rebate could have been covered by the social security system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of what is being done, people will be quite disillusioned. I will give honourable senators an example. Applicants must fill in all sorts of forms&mdash;and there are pages of them&mdash;before they are eligible to get the home child-care allowance. It will be a bureaucratic headache for a large number of people, and it will be of great concern to ordinary people. Just compare this with the child-care cash rebate for people who may be in the work force. All they have to do is fill out a very simple form, go along to the Medicare office and get the cash&mdash;virtually no questions asked. It is a very simple matter. On the other hand, look at what the mother in the home has to go through. She has to fill out all these forms&mdash;and for what? For a mere $2.60 a week. Yet the child-care cash rebate is substantially more than $2.60 a week. In fact, it recognises that a carer is looking after at least two children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think mothers in the home deserve a great deal better than what this government is dealing out to them. I raised a whole range of matters, both in parliament and outside, when the home child-care legislation was discussed in December and February, and I pointed out various inequities and anomalies. For example, if the child-care cash rebate is non-income tested as a cost of earning income, why is not the same true where one spouse is working and the other is looking after children so the first spouse can engage in paid employment? That question has to be answered by the government at some stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another anomaly is switching from the tax concept of annual separate net income to the social security concept. This means that many spouses who would have been eligible for the spouse rebate will get reduced home child-care allowance because expenses allowed in the tax system are not allowed under social security, and the social security concept of income embraces windfalls and gifts not regarded as income under the tax law. So that is another anomaly that has resulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, there are a number of people who will miss out as a result of this action by the government. Families leaving Australia temporarily&mdash;such as diplomats, service families and missionaries&mdash;will be disadvantaged because they will have to pay full Australian tax. They will lose the spouse rebate, but they will not get the home child-care allowance because they are out of Australia for more than three months. I know the government has considered this question, but it is a matter it has overlooked. It has overlooked quite a number of matters. Families with dependent children over 16 will lose the spouse rebate at the with-child rate, but will not get the home child-care allowance. Again, that is a matter that the government has given some consideration to. When I raised those matters previously, the government thought that its scheme was perfect, but it is not perfect. In fact, since I raised those matters, others have re-emphasised the problems in shifting from the tax concept of a spouse rebate to a social security payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As noted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report of 19 September of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, tax agents are starting to scratch their heads over clients with variable incomes needing to lodge up to 26 claims a year for home child-care allowance. And the public are not the only ones confused. Social Security is now saying&mdash;as we see from page 20 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that the self-employed are not to be income tested fortnightly but on the previous year's taxable income. I would like to see chapter and verse the statutory authority for that, given the great to-do that the minister made in February about the advantage of the home child-care allowance being a fortnightly income tested arrangement. Perhaps Senator McMullan could advise us as to the statutory authority for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the tax lawyers in this chamber would know, the income of self-employed people by way of partnership or trust is only derived on 30 June, so they should be entitled to HCCA for 25 out of the 26 fortnights a year&mdash;that is if the minister and the department are correct in saying that HCCA is a fortnightly income tested payment. There is a whole range of these matters that really need to be discussed in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is this a three card trick by the government? Why should the government not give mothers at home caring for their children the same benefits under the same income testing arrangements as those for the child-care rebate? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to a number of the issues raised in the debate on the second reading of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. A number of people were interested in this bill and raised a range of issues. But before I do that, it is important for me to emphasise that, as is usually the case with broad taxation laws amendment bills, the overwhelming majority of provisions in this bill appear to have and, as I understand it, do have the unanimous support of the Senate. Overall, the changes are positive ones for taxpayers and for the taxation system as a whole and that is something to be welcomed as part of the continuing progress of reform of the tax system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, four issues were raised in the discussion. Three related to amendments to the home child-care allowance, the provisional tax uplift, and the sales tax changes, particularly one aspect of them. The fourth issue relates to the points raised by a couple of speakers concerning the legislative framework for the reportable payments system, for which there are no amendments but about which people raised issues in the course of the debate on the second reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Debate on provisional tax uplift and the special matter of the amendment relating to the sales tax changes should be left until the committee stage. We have already had a lot of discussion about provisional tax uplift and there are no new issues of principle there. Debate about appropriate detail is therefore best left to the committee stage. As for sales tax, it is also a matter of the detail of the provision rather than a matter of broad principle. Therefore, in the interests of expediting the business of the Senate, I will leave those two matters for debate in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like now to turn to the reportable payments system. While no-one has proposed any amendment to the new proposal, Senator Boswell and other honourable senators raised some concerns about it. Broadly, those concerns go to whether this will be an intrusive and administratively burdensome system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all honourable senators may be aware of the background to and underlying rationale of the reportable payments system because it has not been a particularly controversial announcement. As there have been no amendments, some honourable senators may not have paid much attention to it. I would therefore like to make some general points and then deal with the particular matters that have been raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reportable payments system&mdash;or, if honourable senators will excuse the shortening of it, the RPS&mdash;is not a tax collection system and it is not a new tax. It is a monitoring mechanism for compliance with the existing tax system. It is an income reporting arrangement to allow the tax office to compare taxpayers' income as they report it with information contained in the income tax return of the income recipient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no discretion in respect of senators, most of the people in the gallery and those who are listening to the debate or who will read the transcript. We make regular PAYE deductions&mdash;fortnightly, or monthly, as the case may be. But for many other people, whose payments are made in other ways, the capacity to establish whether what is being declared as income is an accurate description of the income is not as straightforward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RPS is another part of the mechanism for ensuring that the tax burden is being fairly distributed.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is based on the tax file number arrangements that already apply in the employment and investment areas. Under RPS&mdash;the reportable payments system&mdash;people receiving a reportable payment need only provide their tax file number to the person making the payment in order to prevent deduction of tax at source. In other words, as with other sources of income, if people provide their tax file number, no tax will be deducted other than in PAYE circumstances. But in these circumstances, that will not be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, if one chooses not to provide one's tax file number, tax will be deducted. This is logical: otherwise, firstly, there is no way in which compliance could be established; and, secondly, there is no way in which those people who are evading tax could be caught by this system. This is essentially a matter about enhancing tax compliance to ensure that the amount of income tax which is properly payable is paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are predicted revenue gains for the Commonwealth: some people have said as much as $100 million. I cannot personally vouch for that; time will tell. To the extent that there is revenue gain&mdash;and I believe there will be&mdash;it will not be by way of imposition of a new tax; it will be by way of making people pay the tax for which they are already liable but which they are evading by non-disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of areas have been nominated in respect of this system. The one that caused debate in the Senate was the fishing industry. The extension of the system to other areas will be considered only where the structure of transactions in those areas suits these sorts of income reporting arrangements and the level of tax compliance is such that the introduction of the system is warranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax office has been in consultation with affected industry representative bodies, including the National Fishing Industry Council, in respect of the application of the system to, and the development of the arrangements in, the fishing industry. This consultation has been designed to minimise the compliance cost of the introduction of this new system, but only in so far as we can do so without compromising the integrity of the arrangements. That is the rationale. It is not a new tax. The compliance costs as a result of consultation have been kept to a minimum consistent with effective and fair implementation of the system and ensuring that people pay the tax which they are properly obliged to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that was raised was that of privacy, which always arises when we are considering matters such as the tax file number and similar matters. Let me assure the Senate that the Privacy Commissioner has been consulted throughout the process of the development and introduction of the system. We have made sure that the industries involved have been informed of the privacy requirements; all the relevant brochures and pamphlets produced will emphasise or contain information about privacy issues; and every endeavour will be made to inform those affected by the system of the obligations imposed on payers who have access to tax file numbers. I think most Australians consider that the obligation to comply with the tax system is important and one that should be pursued with rigour, and we will continue to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me turn now to the issue that has been probably at the forefront of the debate about this bill, and that is the home child-care allowance. There are some people, including Senator Harradine, who have raised continuing concerns about its application over the period of the introduction of this system. But first I will go to the core of the matter before dealing with some of the concerns and claims that have been made. I will try to respond to some of the detailed issues in the time available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The core of the matter is that this is, and is seen by Australians to be, an improvement in the method of, and an increase in, the amount of government payments to families. It is a proper recognition by the government of its obligation to provide assistance to Australian families and to do so in a fair way. In this instance that includes directing the payment to the carer rather than to the income earner, as is necessarily done through the tax system, and increasing by some $230 million per annum the amount of the payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the indications are that it is, and is seen to be by Australians, a significant improvement in the operation of, the targeting of and the amount of payments to Australian families. It was an important election commitment of the government in May 1993, and its current implementation has been welcomed by families as the money is beginning to flow in this fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I do not think it is formally required by the standing orders, I suppose that, both in this matter and in relation to provisional tax, I should declare an interest, because my household is likely to be a recipient of this payment. For reasons of tax payments, I have to pay provisional tax, so I am affected by at least two of the measures involved here. With my well-known aversion to fish, people can be assured I am not going to be affected by that one, but I am affected by the other two. I do not think the standing orders require us to declare an interest&mdash;</PARA>

But because I will be involved in the detailed debate in the committee stage, I am informing the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important reform, one that is being welcomed by Australians. It is an important addition to the range of assistance provided to families. It has the major advantage of being paid directly to the parent with the caring responsibility. It is, in the broad scheme of things, inevitable in the debate in the Senate that people focus only on the losers. Let me give some comments about the winners from the introduction of this measure. When a measure increases the cost by $230 million, it means there is $230 million extra being paid to Australian families as a result of this payment. The families which benefited from the with-child rate of DSR will be better off, because it is paid at a higher rate. That is the first thing. It is not a big increase but it is a welcome increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some well targeted and important other things. I will mention just one. About 55,000 families with low taxable incomes who are unable to obtain the full value of the dependent spouse rebate will be, on average, $20 a week better off. That is not a bad start, over and above the increased payment and the improved targeting of the payment in general. There are around 120,000 families which will benefit from the greater responsiveness of the payment. </PARA>

If I have time I will respond to that point&mdash;or we will deal with it later in the committee stage. I will try to get to one of those points during my response. I was talking about the greater responsiveness of the child-care allowance to people's changing circumstances. Also, the annual amount a dependent child can earn&mdash;and the family can still qualify&mdash;is more generous. In summary, there are benefits from these changes which are substantial and which greatly outweigh the relatively small impact that the change will have on a small number of families.</PARA></TALK.START>

It was popular, as it deserved to be, and we are implementing it. It provides $230 million in extra benefits to families. They like it and those opposite do not. It is as simple as that. So we have this complaint that we misled people but my clear advice is that the Prime Minister never said there would be no loser. What he did say in the election speech, which I listened to&mdash;I suspect those opposite did not&mdash;is that this allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One of the wonderful things is that some of the lowest income families in this country are going to be very substantially better off in ways that I think all Australians will welcome. A bit of carping about it on the sidelines only helps us to highlight the contrast between our providing effective assistance to families in the greatest need and those opposite, who do not have any policies. They need to carp and express concern because they do not have any policies of their own.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the claim which has been made that there will be up to 200,000 losers has been based on an estimate of the total number of people receiving the part-rate with-child DSR. It is nonsense to say that all those people will be losers. The majority of them will be winners also. Most part-raters will benefit from the increase in the maximum rate, which will flow up the line to them. Some of them will gain much more because their taxable income was too low to get the maximum DSR. Some will gain because they receive a part-rate DSR due to having a part-time job for a few weeks of the year. A number of other groups will be in the same or a slightly better position. Those getting part-rate because of bank interest and those with shares will have, as I understand it, no change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Latest available estimates from the Australian Taxation Office show that in 1992-93 about 680,000 families received the with-child rate of dependent spouse rebate. The home child-care allowance data available to date shows that as many families who in 1992-93 got the maximum rate with-child DSR are already receiving the maximum rate of home child-care allowance after only 10 days of operation. A much higher proportion of these grants are being made at the maximum rate than was the case with the dependent spouse rebate in the year 1992-93. Those are important facts to put on the table. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national Fishing Industry Council has argued that the provisions of the bill implementing the reportable payments system will increase compliance costs for the industry by imposing further unnecessary and unproductive paperwork and administration, particularly for those who are already complying with the tax laws.

I know it is one of those balance issues that has arisen since the time of William Pitt and the rate of tax on the import of wine, in dealing with smugglers, and trying to reduce the tax to get more revenue. So it has been an issue of public policy for 700 years. But it seems to me that we cannot fail to pursue a matter that requires people properly to disclose the income they earn for fear that some of those who fail to do so deliberately will go to even more elaborate lengths to evade. I accept that some may. There is no evidence yet, but I certainly cannot say that it is impossible.

Conceptually, I think the system is right. It seems on the face of it to be the logical place to start, because there are a small number of payers paying to a large number of people in an area where there is not a PAYE system operating.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to raise some concerns, having spoken to the fishing industry in Queensland. This new reportable payments system is being imposed on them. I think this also applies to the clothing sector. Both of those sectors of industry are not PAYE systems; they are paid on performance. In other words, a deck hand on a boat is paid by way of a percentage of the catch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem which arises here is that when fishermen sell fish to a wholesaler, they have to then give the tax file number. That wholesaler may sell it to another wholesaler; it may go through four or five different wholesalers before it reaches a retailer. That is going to put a lot of paperwork into the system. The fishing industry tells me it has a clean bill of health from the Taxation Office. It recognises that there is limited or very little evasion in the fishing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fishing industry has asked me to ask for a review of the case of the industry to see whether this measure is going to stamp out tax evasion and whether it will stamp out illegal fishing. People who do not have a fishing licence&mdash;they are known in the industry as shamateurs, halfway between an amateur and a professional&mdash;do not pay any levies. They will still be able to sell their fish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people might have a job that allows them some time during the day when they can go out and fish; they may be firemen or policemen, or someone like that. These people have days when they can go out and fish and they retail their fish to fish shops and wholesalers without paying tax. The fishing industry does not believe that this reportable payment system will make it harder for those people. In fact, the industry is saying it will make it easier for those people to bypass the system, and it will impose a lot more costs on the fishing industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell made two preliminary points before the point that both he and Senator Harradine made to which I will also respond. With regard to the extra paperwork: I said during the second reading debate that we have been in discussion with the Fishing Industry Council seeking to minimise the cost of compliance consistent with maintaining the integrity of the system. It is not as if this is an area where there is no paperwork or in which people have no obligations now to report to the tax system. It is not going to require the development of a new system. It is consistent with our overall approach. We will seek to keep the paperwork to a minimum, but I cannot guarantee that it will be nil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine asserted in his speech during the second reading debate that&mdash;and I did not want to respond to it in a way that would be controversial or give offence to the honest people in the industry, of which there are many, I accept&mdash;this is an industry with a very high record of compliance. I have not been closely involved with the administration of the tax system since the last election, but I have to say that, overall, that is not consistent with my recollection of the surveys that were undertaken when I was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to say that is in any way a slur on many of the people in the industry whom I know are honest citizens and are paying their proper taxes. There is no doubt that there are many in that area who are that way inclined; but I cannot say regionally whether there is some variation in that because I do not have any evidence to base it on. There is a view that there is a compliance problem within this industry. If there is not, then that will show up reasonably quickly in the paperwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the point that both Senator Harradine and Senator Boswell raised as to whether we can in some way monitor the impact of this. That is something which I have raised with and will refer to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear), who is the minister directly responsible. I assure the committee that there will be some form of follow-up to monitor cost-effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me qualify it now so that when it comes back there is not some sense that, in giving that assurance, I have given something we could not deliver on. Firstly, as I am advised, the industry specification of sources of taxation revenue is probably less than perfect; so the base may not be ideal. Secondly, there are consequential changes. Once this system is introduced, it is possible that some of the people involved will move into the PAYE system and out of this system of payments, because the benefit of not being in the PAYE system will be reduced. The figures will not be unambiguous, and I make that clear right from the start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is reasonable to request that we make some attempt to monitor industry by industry the consequences of this. I cannot give honourable senators a guarantee about how comprehensively we will be able to do that, because of the problems in the statistical base from which we are working. Some of the parallel changes that will go on that will not be identified as consequences of this change will show up in other parts of the statistics. I make those qualifications beforehand so that, when the report, such as it is, is developed subsequently, people do not accuse me of not having fully advised the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So the minister did not say that; I misheard it. Clearly, there is extra paperwork. I wish to refer to page 4 and the definition of reportable payment. Reportable payment means a payment that `is declared by the regulations to be a reportable payment for the purposes of this Division'. Does that not enable the government to extend to the whole of the economy by regulation a massive expansion of paperwork and bureaucracy which will be a disguised tax on employment and business?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are giving the government open slather. I do not know what we are doing that for because the definition makes it perfectly clear that a reportable payment means a payment that is declared by the regulation to be a reportable payment. We know what the government considers to be a reportable payment and now by regulation it can virtually say what it likes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point, interestingly enough, is that reportable payment means a payment that is assessable income. It might well be that an employer does not know what is assessable income for the  purposes of the payee. The payer may not know in respect of moneys provided to the payee what may be assessable income. For example, if one sells one's car, does the payer know whether it is a personal or a business car? These are the sorts of things that may or may not have been considered by the officials. Certainly, it will cause a lot of confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the penalty is set out in proposed new section 22OAF(2) on page 6 of the bill. If these things are not done by the payer, the payer must deduct 48.4 per cent of the payment. The minister, although not seeking to belittle the position, seemed to say, `If the tax file number is not given and certain other requirements are not observed'&mdash;for example, the one that I am talking about now&mdash;`then the payer must deduct 48.4 per cent of the payment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take the case of a fishing contractor who is working for a payer. That contractor may have commitments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this system, the government is deducting 48.4 per cent of the outgoings of a person's responsibilities to his or her employees. Why is that amount included at such a high rate? Should it not be compared with, for example, the 15 per cent to 25 per cent that is applied under prescribed payments schemes? Why is there such an enormous penalty when, for example, an employer could be confused and not know what is assessable income?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine has raised several points, and I will need to deal with the last one in more detail. Senator Harradine asked why it is proposed that we proceed by way of regulation. He would know better than any honourable senator that those regulations are all subject to the scrutiny of, and the potential disallowance by, the Senate; that is one thing of which he is the master. But we would not want to deal with each instance by way of a bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, this proposal is consistent with the way in which the prescribed payments system&mdash;which is the closest analogy&mdash;operates. It is not as though there is an incentive for the government to declare lots of these payments because, in areas where we are already getting revenue, it is expenditure for the government for nothing. Even if some senators are very suspicious of the assurances that I give, I can say that there is no incentive or benefit for the government to do that. I can assure honourable senators that we would proceed with that very cautiously. The development of these regulations is being done with very close consultation with the industries concerned. I put that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the withholding of 48.4 per cent of a person's income if a tax file number is not supplied, all we are proposing to do is deal with people under this system in exactly the same way as every other person is dealt with when a tax file number is not supplied, including under the prescribed payments system. If a tax file number is supplied, 15 per cent or 20 per cent is withheld, and that is more comparable with the PAYE system. We are not proposing to do that here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the PPS, the normal PAYE system, bank interest or whatever source of income is involved, if a tax file number is not supplied, 48.4 per cent is deducted. There is a simple reason for that: if that were not the case, people in the highest tax bracket&mdash;who pay 48.4 per cent&mdash;would benefit from not providing a tax file number, compared with people on lower rates of tax who would not benefit. The system could not operate fairly at other than the top rate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not every family who is in receipt of the dependent spouse rebate will be better off, so it is therefore not more generous. For many people, it is not more generous. As I have said before, the home child-care allowance has been a disaster from the beginning to the end. I bet the people in the Taxation Office cannot believe the way they have to deal with the people in the Department of Social Security and the difficulties they have encountered with transferring this allowance from Taxation to Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a commendable first step in the recognition of the role of parents, mostly mothers, caring for children at home. But it began as a deception, a pea and thimble trick on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the election speech, and it has deteriorated into what can only be described as a bungle and a debacle. When the home child-care allowance was first before the parliament, I raised a concern at the number of people who are unlikely to benefit from this new allowance or who would receive a substantially lower benefit from it than they presently receive from the dependent spouse rebate. That was the first time that was ever brought to public attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government was not going to tell people, `Look, I am awfully sorry, it is more generous for some, but there are a lot of you who are going to miss out or who are going to get less money than you got under the dependent spouse rebate.' The government did not bother to tell them that. It is the different treatment of income under the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Social Security Act which causes thousands of Australian families to be worse off. According to evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, up to 800,000 people could be affected by the different definitions of `income'. Mr Peter McDonald, the National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, in his evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on 19 September put it this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are some very serious anomalies that will affect hundreds of thousands of families and they will be worse off at the end of the day . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That, for me, is not the same as, `It is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate.' He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From what I have been able to glean out of the Australian Taxation Office statistical annual reports, there are in the order of at least 200,000 families who may be worse off.</PARA>
<PARA>In addition to these families, as I outlined earlier in the debate, the bill as originally drafted would mean that a number of other families would have been worse off because of differences in the qualifying criteria. Families overseas for longer than 13 weeks will be adversely affected. That would include aid workers, missionaries, academics, exchange students&mdash;people who go away for a period longer than 13 weeks and who are paying tax here in Australia; people who are on Australian salaries when they are engaged overseas in those activities. They would not be eligible for the home child-care allowance and would no longer be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate at the rate payable for those who have children. They would be $372 a year worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group, families with children who are dependent full-time students, aged 18 to 25, whose income is less than $1,785 a year, will be worse off. I was told by a government senator&mdash;I cannot remember who it was&mdash;that, `There are not many students who earn less than $1,785. They all go out to work.' Let me tell that senator that there are a lot of country students who cannot earn $1,785 from part-time jobs. There might be young people in the cities who can get jobs at McDonald's, but out in the bush students are not able to get part-time work and earn that amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are families which will be adversely affected by the inequitable treatment of unrealised capital gains under the Department of Social Security definition of income. Contrary to the government's claims that the home child-care allowance would benefit all those on low incomes, couples where both partners are unemployed would be excluded from receiving HCCA because it is means tested on only the child carer's income. Because of the introduction of the partner allowance, which effectively splits the unemployment benefit between both members of an unemployed couple, the child carer's income will be too high to receive the home child-care allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people who receive very irregular incomes preferred the dependent spouse rebate because it made it much easier for them to reconcile their financial affairs at the end of the year. Mr McDonald, the National Director of the Australian Taxpayers Association, described the administration with regard to these people and the HCCA as absolutely abominable. He said that many people in part-time employment, with wild fluctuations in income, could find themselves having to lodge up to 26 applications on an ongoing basis each year. That seems unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families that have relatively low incomes spread between two partners could also be worse off. Rural families will have particular problems because the social security income test includes many forms of income not included in the income tax test. There are also anomalies between taxpayers who are wage and salary earners and those who are self-employed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment is clear evidence that the government has realised that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. The government has admitted that its bill, as originally drafted, would have left a large number of Australians worse off. The government's amendment will provide that families are able to fall back on the dependent spouse rebate, if they qualify for that rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the crucial point in this amendment is that those families with dependent children who currently qualify for the with-child rate of dependent spouse rebate and do not qualify for the home child-care allowance will still be worse off because they will be able to claim the dependent spouse rebate only at the without-child rate. They would be eligible only for an amount that is paid at a considerably lower rate. They will be $372 a year worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government originally sought to obtain political capital by introducing changes that were designed to demonstrate its commitment to recognising the role of home child carers and to helping families with a parent&mdash;more likely than not, a mother&mdash;at home. The home child-care allowance was Mr Keating's key election policy commitment to women. As I said before, he pledged in that campaign launch that this allowance would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate that it would replace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many families, it is not more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it replaces. Mr Keating hoodwinked the Australian public and, in particular, he hoodwinked Australian mothers who are at home caring for their children. They were the people who were tricked and hoodwinked in that election campaign. Thousands of families will be considerably worse off as a result of the move from the dependent spouse rebate to the home child-care allowance, even with this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having given the implied promise that no family would be worse off, that the home child-care allowance would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate, the government should have made sure that people who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance were eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate at the higher level at which they presently receive it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be moving an amendment, which was foreshadowed by Senator Watson and circulated in the chamber, which provides that, if a family does not qualify for the home child-care allowance, it still will be eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate at the higher with-child level. That is the purpose of my amendment. These families were not identified by the government, and they still will not be dealt with adequately unless the government is prepared to adopt the amendment that I will move. The opposition will not be supporting the government's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is wrong for the government to seek to paint into a corner those of us who have problems with the way HCCA is organised and running, suggesting that somehow we are not in favour of the system or the principle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government has now acknowledged that there are problems, has introduced this legislation to claw back some money for those who lose all HCCA and indeed acknowledged a further problem about a fortnight ago&mdash;which is why we have this amendment before us&mdash;we cannot see why it is not sufficient to make allowance for those families who used to get the dependent spouse rebate and who will now get nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now acknowledges with this amendment that many people are losing part of that payment. But the amendment goes only part way to the solution. The government is going only a little further along the line, saying that families can have back some of the money. But these families will be about $241 a year worse off, which is basically a week's pay for low income earners. If the government has acknowledged in the first place that the principle is right, I cannot see why there is a problem. If there is a further problem, hence the amendments, why do we not go that extra step and make sure that all families will benefit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer again to the advertising. I do not have the original advertisement before me, but I have already gone through it in my contribution to the second reading debate. Nothing in that ad even talks about replacing the dependent spouse rebate, hence the number of complaints and calls to my office once people began applying and began to understand how the system really works. We have heard on talkback radio over the past few weeks the confusion about it, with people asking, `What has happened to the $60? We have lost $50-odd through the tax system.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the government that, if the advertising had been more carefully thought out, some of the flak that we now have simply would not be occurring. If the advertising had gone that extra step and been honest enough to say, `We are replacing the dependent spouse rebate. You may be entitled to the home child-care allowance,' we would not have some of the problems with the lack of community understanding that we have today. So we will not support the government's amendment but we will support the opposition's amendment and we will move an amendment of our own. </PARA>

As a result of the legislation that we are discussing today and the operation of the HCCA legislation, that family would stand to lose $237; that is the cut that it would experience.

The government suggests that, if that is the case, they will get the without-child grant. Why? That is what we have to ask ourselves. It is miserly. It is a sort of anti-child mentality that is creeping in. I do not think the government is doing this deliberately. I think there are members of the government who understand that this really is a taxation question. </PARA>

He said something like this: `This area must essentially not be able to be achieved through the taxation system.' That is, to try to get the money to the actual carer requires measures which cannot be achieved through the taxation system. That is a lot of nonsense. Of course it can be achieved through the taxation system except in respect of families whose income is not sufficient for that purpose, and that can be dealt with in the social security area. </PARA>

Why did the minister not do that? There are more examples than the one I have just referred to; they are endless. I refer honourable senators to my speech of 23 February. I do not want to go through that speech again because I know we have to get on to the matter of drought, which is a very important area. But this is also a very important area.

A number of issues that have been raised in the debate have been raised previously on a number of occasions and, indeed, have been responded to by the minister and other speakers on behalf of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to cover a couple of issues, even though they have been touched on previously in this debate, from the government's perspective. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, did not mislead the people about the promise. He never said there would be no losers. I will quote from his election speech. I viewed the election speech; I am not sure whether the opposition did. When he announced HCCA the Prime Minister said, `This allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace.' We have delivered on this promise. Overall, HCCA is estimated to cost some $230 million more than the dependent spouse rebate, and that is not an insignificant amount of money in the context of a government program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees made some comments about the advertisements. The advertisements did not in all cases refer to the fact that it replaces the with-child rebate of DSR. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not finished my comments on this. Senator Herron should perhaps wait until he hears the comments. The advertisement was designed to give a simple message about eligibility criteria. The direct mail which was sent out to over 1.5 million families inviting them to claim did include this information. It was extensively market tested and the level of understanding on this point was extremely high. In addition, all letters advising recipients of a grant of HCCA reminded them to fill in a new employment declaration form if they were receiving the DSR via lower regular tax instalments. As I said earlier, it is not easy to explain to over 1 1/2 million people the detail required in all circumstances through a TV and radio advertising campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch briefly on the hypocrisy of the coalition with regard to this issue.

Mr Ruddock, in his press release of 7 October on this matter, stated, `No Australian family should be financially disadvantaged'&mdash;absolutely none, despite the fact that we are improving the contribution by some $230 million. So the opposition says we should cut the deficit, but we should continue to allow for child-care expenses in a payment that supports people to stay home to care for children.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current social security system has become a confusing maze  . . . the Opposition has long advocated the introduction of a . . . simpler system.</PARA>
<PARA>But the coalition is now advocating through its position a system that would be almost unworkable in its complexity&mdash;where families have to prove that they did not qualify for the HCCA in the social security system, even if they did not claim and receive it, before getting any DSR in the tax system. That is an absurd position for the opposition to be taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has greatly exaggerated the number of losers. I suppose that when it is in opposition, has been there for so long and is likely to be there for so long, it has to take this sort of approach to play up concerns in the community. That is very unfortunate for those people in the community who have been conned by the opposition. It has greatly exaggerated the number of losers and it gives wrong examples of losers. It has stated that the government is hurting people by counting carers' pensions as income for HCCA purposes. In fact, it is already counted as income for the  purposes of the DSR separate net income test. That is one example where I believe the opposition has misled the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I asserted earlier and as the minister has asserted, we did not give an unqualified undertaking that there would be no losers. We gave an undertaking that under this new proposal Australian families would be $230 million better off. That is why I hope the committee supports this amendment. This amendment and others which were foreshadowed by the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) in his second reading speech will allow taxpayers the choice of claiming the without-child dependent spouse rebate instead of claiming the home child-care allowance, if they wish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments will simplify the arrangements and remove any adverse consequences for a family choosing the home child-care allowance payments in lieu of the taxpayer claiming the without-child dependent spouse rebate. This is achieved by allowing taxpayers to calculate their dependent spouse rebate entitlement by determining the notional rebate they would have been entitled to and then subtracting from that notional rebate any HACCA payments received during the relevant period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1994-95 transitional year arrangements require this amendment and others to ensure that entitlement to the with-child dependent spouse rebate for the period from 1 July to 29 September 1994 is retained. So I hope the committee will support the government amendment but I suspect that will not be the outcome, given the way in which the votes will line up. I think that is an unfortunate blow to the very significant social reform to which this government committed itself at the last election and on which it is delivering. </PARA>

We could have a system that delivers a formal payment through the tax system, but we would also need a delivery of payments through the social security system.

<PARA>As I stated during the second reading debate, and again when I spoke to the government's amendment No. 4 to clause 57, thousands of Australian families will be worse off as a result of this legislation. Families that qualify for the dependent spouse rebate will not be eligible for the home child-care allowance because of the stricter Department of Social Security criteria. In addition, there will be thousands of families who will qualify for HCCA but who, because of different income definitions, will not receive the full amount of HCCA. </PARA>

The promise that the Prime Minister made was that the home child-care allowance would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate. He should have then qualified that and said it would be more generous for those who qualify for the home child-care allowance. When he said, `We are going to have $230 million to distribute to carers of children at home', the honest thing to do would have been to qualify it by saying `for those who are eligible for this $30 a week'&mdash;although it will not be $30 a week for all of them anyway. He should have said, `Some of you will be worse off, you won't be getting $30 a week, and some of you won't get anything at all.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those families with dependent children who currently qualify for the with-child rate of the dependent spouse rebate and who do not qualify for the home child-care allowance would still have been worse off under the proposed government amendment which we have just voted against because they would have been able to claim the dependent spouse rebate only at the without-child rate. The intention of the amendment I have moved is to ensure that those families who currently receive the with-child dependent spouse rebate and are not eligible for the HCCA because of stricter eligibility tests will continue to receive the with-child dependent spouse rebate. In addition, the amendment removes from the calculation of separate net income both the child-care cash rebate and the home child-care allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition supports the amendment moved by the Democrats. We will support it because it will further address the shoddy manner in which the government has approached this legislation from the outset and also ensure that what positive aspects there are are preserved. The insertion of proposed subsection (5F) would prevent taxpayers claiming partial spouse rebates where the spouse qualifies for the full rate of home child-care allowance. This amendment recognises that it is only where the full rate of HCCA is payable that reliance upon the dependent spouse rebate should be forgone. Of course, the number of people who will qualify for the full rate of HCCA will be far smaller than the number of those who do not. We can thank the government for that.

The dependent spouse rebate is not retained to allow taxpayers to withhold the benefits of a rebate from their spouses. Rather, it is necessary for the protection of families this government has forgotten in what has been a cheap and a deplorable bid for votes. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition and the Democrats say they do not want to run a dual system&mdash;a with-child DSR and the HCCA. They want to give people the option to fall back onto the DSR only if they do not qualify for any HCCA payment during the previous year. There is no practical way to design such a system. This is because the DSR is based on a financial year eligibility and the HCCA is based on eligibility in a fortnight. To pay DSR only after HCCA qualification for the year is tested would require clients to test their HCCA qualification 26 times a year, each fortnight. This would be nonsensical and surely cannot be supported by the coalition, the Democrats or the Greens. As well, it would be virtually impractical to determine HCCA qualification retrospectively, which is what the Democrats' amendments propose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To preclude any payment of DSR if the family qualified for maximum HCCA, even if they did not claim it or receive it, runs a strong risk of these families missing out altogether and losing up to $1,560 a year. This is when the coalition and the Democrats are complaining that the government amendment would have resulted in a maximum loss of around $240 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendment was sounder in terms of policy and was workable for clients and administrators. In allowing people to get either the without-child DSR or HCCA throughout the year, we ensure no-one receives nothing. At the end of the financial year they can apply for the without-child DSR and if they received less HCCA they could get the difference between the two. There are also a number of technical problems with the way the amendments are being drafted which we believe cause problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I want to make some reference to the position of Senator Lees and the Democrats.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is more than just cosmetic. It represents a big shift in both philosophy and community attitudes . . . It is a major improvement on the old system of the dependent spouse rebate.</PARA>
<PARA>The Democrats are now saying, `The government's family policy is based on a big con.' That is the press release of the 6th of this month. It does beg the question: if Senator Lees believes that now, why did she not do sufficient work on this matter back in February? But she is still wrong.

<PARA>The purpose of this amendment is to reduce the provisional tax uplift factor for 1994-95 and subsequent years from eight per cent to five per cent. Yesterday I canvassed the arguments, and I will do so again very briefly, for our settling on five per cent. The main reason we think eight per cent is unfair is that it is an uplift factor which is nearly four times the inflation rate. The effect of that will be that small businesses, farmers and independent retirees will have their taxable income from last year automatically increased by eight per cent. It does not take cognisance of the so-called other factors, the other things which are happening in the economy and in their industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will collect something like $250 million from this. We know that most of it will be refunded in the next tax year, but I think the important thing to note is that in the meantime it will affect the cashflows of small businesses. It would be much better for the $250 million to be given back to small businesses so that they can get on with the job they do well&mdash;job generation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why five per cent? We think that is a more appropriate median figure for expected provisional tax income growth than eight per cent. The government has forecast growth in average weekly earnings this year to be about 3.5 per cent; in real GDP, 4.5 per cent; and, in inflation, 2.25 per cent. So five per cent is reasonably consistent with growth. The all ordinaries index grew by five per cent and there was a 5.72 per cent rise in retail trade in the year to June. Setting the uplift factor at five per cent would allow for the expected rise in interest income as interest rates rise, and there could be some recovery in property incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of setting it at that figure is that it would provide a well-timed boost to small business. I have heard the government's argument. Of more interest to me, I guess, is the position on this matter of members of the opposition because they say that they are the champions of small businesses. The government probably acknowledges that they pay a lot of attention to the big end of town and not quite as much to the smaller end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Kemp, Senator Short, Senator Panizza and Senator Boswell speak yesterday about how bad the principles of the tax system are for small business. That is obviously the reason we said that this is an opportunity to do something about it. Groups such as COSBOA, with which the opposition would be familiar, the Small Business Forum, ACCI and the Retailers Council have asked the opposition for assistance by supporting this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has chosen to use a number of arguments which I canvassed yesterday&mdash;essentially, that it is plundering the revenue, which it is not, and that small business is already engaged in working it out for this year so they do not want the money back yet, but they might get it back next year because the opposition will put everybody on notice that it will not do it this year but it will think about doing it next year. The other reason is that it does not want to block supply. People in small business believed that for a short time until it was possible to point out to them the difference between money bills, tax bills, supply, appropriation and all the different terminologies that can often be used deliberately to confuse people. I think it is the politics of this issue that are more important to the opposition than the immediate opportunity to support small business, and I think that is regrettable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Watson said during the second reading debate on this bill, there are a number of measures in this bill that leave a bitter aftertaste in the mouth of members of the coalition. Not least of those is the government's decision to maintain the provisional uplift factor at eight per cent. It does seem too high. I will be asking Senator McMullan to give us much more detail. The government has been pretty coy to date as to how the eight per cent figure was derived, because it certainly does seem much too high when we take into account the government's own forecasts for inflation and real income growth during 1994-95. I hope Senator McMullan will address that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We agree with the Democrats that the eight per cent figure is too high. As Senator Kernot said, we have put the government on notice that next year we will be looking very closely at whatever figure it brings up. But there are some important points of principle in this matter. So far as the government is concerned, of course, it is yet another very clear example of the disdain in which the government holds the small business sector, self-employed persons, retirees and the like. There is no doubt that it is very damaging to simply maintain the eight per cent figure this year. It does hit the small business sector and we recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out, though, with respect to Senator Kernot, that it is a short-term hit in the sense that it does not increase the total tax paid over time by provisional taxpayers. What it means is that they will pay less provisional tax next time than they will this year. So if we take it over time, of course, it does not affect the total level of the tax bill. Certainly, the $250 million or thereabouts that Senator Kernot referred to is not an unimportant figure, particularly for many struggling small businesses today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other side of the coin there are some important principles. We in the coalition have for long maintained the principle that government budget measures are entitled to carriage unless&mdash;a very important consideration&mdash;the measure represents a broken promise on the part of the government and unless the measure is retrospective. They are the two particular reasons why the coalition would feel obliged to oppose government budget revenue measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, in this instance, neither of those two conditions applies. The coalition has been arguing strongly that the government should be taking much stronger measures to get its fiscal house in order. Small business is in trouble today because of the inept, incompetent economic management of this government. Because the government has let huge budget deficits run, it has put more pressure on interest rates, and high interest rates are the killers of small business. Through the ineptitude of its fiscal management this government has been the prime architect of the problems that the small business sector faces today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that there are not the two preconditions that we have always had as a matter of principle in relation to opposing budget measures, it is difficult for the coalition&mdash;as a principle to coalition&mdash;to say to the government on the one hand, `Get your fiscal act together. Get your budget deficit down', and on the other hand to say, `You have determined your budget for this year, but it is far too high a deficit, anyway. We want you to take a measure which will increase that deficit by another $250 million or so.' That would put still further upward pressure on interest rates and compound the problems that the government has already imposed on the small business sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that the coalition, while understanding the point that Senator Kernot has made, will not be supporting the Australian Democrat's amendment. I hope Senator Kernot realises the irony and the hypocrisy of what she proposes. She talks about playing politics, but she is the ultimate political opportunist. If the Democrats were fair dinkum and were really serious about wanting to do things for small business, they would stop taking the continual measures which are now in their economic policy platform and which would vastly increase government expenditure to the tune of billions and billions of dollars. I think the Democrats expenditure proposals at the moment are something like $20 billion plus over the present level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has to be financed by additional taxation, or possibly by borrowing in the short term. In the end, the taxpayer has to pay for the totally extravagant, damaging, job destroying policies of the Democrats&mdash;particularly in the rural areas of Australia that are suffering so grievously today. If the Democrats were really serious about having any concern for small business in this country, and about having any concern for those people in the bush who are having such a desperately difficult time today, they would be pursuing policies which were aimed at decreasing the burden of taxation on small business; to decrease the level of interest rates to give small business a chance to grow and thrive as we all want it to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, the whole thrust of the Democrats' policies ever since I have been in this place, but increasingly over the last five years, has been bigger government spending, higher government taxation, higher interest rates, less savings for investment, less job creation, less small business, and less growth in the economy. With great respect to Senator Kernot, I have to say that the hypocrisy of the Democrats in moving this amendment is monumental. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted to say that that irony, that hypocrisy, and that basic inconsistency in the economic policy proposals of the Democrats are very well recognised in the small business community. The coalition is sorry that the uplift factor being maintained at eight per cent is as high as it is. I have asked Senator McMullan to explain to us precisely how the government arrives at eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are important points of principle here. If a party is going to be a disciplined and principled political party, unlike the Australian Democrats, then there are certain principles that it has to adhere to. This is one in this particular budget measure. For those reasons, with reluctance, we will not be supporting the Democrats' amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, some of it is on the public record already; but I am just talking about some of the additional specific things to which people referred. I will provide what information I can. The fascinating thing about that debate&mdash;I am trying to be as objective observer as I can of the debate between Senator Short and Senator Kernot&mdash;was the interesting struggle for a bit of credibility, about who will be seen as the credible opposition. It was a nil-all draw.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Short for taking some of the hyperbole out of this debate. He brought some more sober assessment to the implications of it&mdash;both for small business and for the revenue, and he was correct on both counts. His contribution about macro-economic policy was not quite so considered and does not stand as a very sober reflection, but it is a debate for another day. Looking at what is happening in interest rates in other countries would perhaps expose some of the weaknesses in his points; but this is not the time to get involved in all that. It is interesting to see this conflict going on and I expect to see more of it as the struggle for credibility between the competing opposition parties continues. Good luck to them both. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things to remember&mdash;and I will talk about the basis for setting the provisional tax uplift factor in a moment&mdash;is that a substantial number of people who pay provisional tax get a lot of their income from interest.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask Senator Panizza to think about that for a moment and then come back to me. The other thing is that people derive their income from profitability related measures. That also has increased very significantly. I do not think eight per cent would be an unreasonable assessment of incomes driven by measures related to profitability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to remember is that those most likely to gain most from those income sources rising quickest are those with the highest income. So the unintended consequence of Senator Kernot's proposed amendment to clause 65 is that some of the people with the biggest incomes in this country are the biggest winners. That seems to me to be a distributional problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not the sort of information base to break that down. That is not me quoting the tax statistics, it is just an application of logic to known facts&mdash;that must be so&mdash;and it is a redistributive impact which, if Senator Kernot thought about it, would dampen her enthusiasm for this proposal. I know we are getting close to the suspension of the sitting for lunch and we want to get this particular clause finished before then, so I will not speak any more in the generality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of aggregate income subject to provisional tax is difficult to predict with accuracy. Nobody should pretend that we can predict with precision for any one year exactly what it will be. Whatever we do, it will be too high for some people and too low for others. That is why we have the arrangements that allow taxpayers to approach the Taxation Office to vary their provisional tax, as some do, and those figures were given to the Senate committee. That goes to some of Senator Harradine's points but not all. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, that is right and that is why it tends to be higher income people who use it most often&mdash;not because of the penalties but because of the point Senator Panizza was making about the possible cost. Sometimes that is exaggerated but I accept that there is a potential cost and, in some circumstances, a significant cost. I accept that that is logically correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we try to get an uplift factor which is on average, over time and across taxpayers, a reasonable reflection of the growth in income of provisional taxpayers, and the eight per cent uplift factor has regard to the expected average annual growth in income subject to provisional tax over the next several years. We do not want to provide a timing advantage to recipients of income subject to provisional tax compared to PAYE taxpayers. I think we have to balance the fairness and equity measures in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are a number of hidden equity issues in this that are important. There are significant revenue measures but I would just be wasting the committee's time if I went through those&mdash;Senator Short has already dealt with them&mdash;and there are redistributive factors. But some of the areas of income most prone to having provisional tax applied to them are those which are increasing most quickly. So one has to realise the balancing factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to pretend there is great science here; that we could predict that next year it will be 7.9 per cent and bet the house on it. But one has to look at the medium-term prospect. Looking at the nature of income involved, the low but still existent rate of inflation, and the increase in interest rates and profitability, this is a reasonable assessment. I would be surprised if we found a significantly increased number of people seeking a reassessment, or finding that they had significantly overpaid and were seeking a rebate but the statistics will show that up afterwards and those are matters we can pursue over the years. However, when it comes up next year and we have a look at those figures, we will see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available, those are the broad parameters of the criteria of making the decision and the best statistics I can supply in response to the questions people asked. If people subsequently want to ask specific questions not related to this clause, which I hope we can finish dealing with, on behalf of the minister I will be happy to try to seek that information for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the coalition opposition to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994. The major amendments proposed in this bill will do two things. The bill will set the level of Commonwealth vocational education and training funding for 1994 to 1996. Secondly, it will provide for payments to the Australian National Training Authority for additional trainees under the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth provides grants to the states and the territories for the provision and support of vocational education and training, primarily in the technical and further education system. Prior to 1 January 1994, grants to the states and territories were provided in accordance with the provisions of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989. These grants contributed to general operating costs and infrastructure&mdash;in other words, they were recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants. From 1 January 1994 the funding arrangements under the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989 were replaced by funding arrangements under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Under the new arrangements a single pool of funds, comprising the previously separate recurrent expenditure grants and capital expenditure grants, is passed to ANTA for allocation amongst the states and territories. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 gave effect to an agreement announced by the Prime Minister in July 1992 between the Commonwealth, states and territories for the establishment of ANTA. The objectives of the agreement include the establishment of a national vocational education and training system, closer interaction between industry and providers of vocational education and training, an effective training market and improved cross-sectoral links. The functions of ANTA include allocating and remitting funding to state and territory training agencies on the basis of guidelines determined by the ministerial council, and administering any programs agreed by the ministerial council as requiring national delivery within the guidelines approved by the council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the bill currently being debated the main provisions are in clause 4, which will insert new sections 9, 9A and 9A(1) into the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. Section 9 currently provides for payments to ANTA for allocation under the ANTA Act 1992 of $638.96 million in 1994 and $719.7 million in 1995. The effect of the new section will be to amend the amounts payable to ANTA in the following manner: it will increase the amount payable in 1994 from $638 million to $673.6 million and the amount in 1995 from $719.7 million to $755.7 million, and it will set out the amount payable for 1996. It is a very substantial amount which we are putting into this part of education in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of administration, a lot of difficulties are surfacing. The real issues that we need to face are: what are the intentions of the federal government, and what are its strategies as outlined in the white paper? Is the government really focused on increasing and improving the skills of Australians, or is it more interested in trying to pull down the unemployment figures just for a gloss effect for public perception purposes?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague the shadow spokesperson and member for Braddon, Mr Miles, informs me that there are deep concerns being expressed in relation to the questions of training and skilling in this area of education. For example, a recent report by Vince Fitzgerald, which was commissioned by ANTA and was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Successful reform: competitive skills for Australians and Australian enterprises</EMPHASIS>, expresses some of those concerns. In its chapter entitled `Successful reform', under the heading `Inadequate performance planning and reporting', it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continued reliance on Frameworks, Guidelines, Policies, Procedures, Protocols, Memorandums and other paraphernalia of government avoids the central question of what is the performance target, what is the work and business plan and where are the annual reports against reform targets for each of those agencies or organisations actually responsible for the reforms.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not going to skill this country and we are not going to develop a more competent work force unless this money is effectively used and unless there are administrative arrangements in place which set up clear, measurable targets that are identifiable publicly and that can be achieved. At the moment, all the evidence indicates that money is being allocated by the parliament, but the progress is not very great. There is deep concern out there expressed by a whole range of people, organisations and industry involved in the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report said that there are confused accountabilities and responsibilities. If we are going to make progress and if there is not to be so much red tape and bureaucracy in this field, the government has got to give some clear direction in this arena. The Fitzgerald report says in its conclusion to this particular chapter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our assessment . . . relates to both the substance of the national training reforms themselves and to their strategic management. In both areas they have been found wanting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report finds the reforms wanting with regard to strategic management. The whole direction of ANTA really comes back to the federal government and, clearly, there is lack of direction from this government. There are literally thousands of people out there in businesses who are ignored or locked out of the training procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act also set out the goals of an effective training market and other objectives which the government and the council have agreed to, but they are simply not being realised. There is also a concern that the proposed funding levels as set out are unrealistically low, and the government is really trying to force an agenda onto the states which is going to cause problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreements between the states and the federal government have not yet been made, and there is a suspicion that the federal government is pushing off responsibilities to the states and giving them a certain amount of money, but expecting them to do far more than that money will ever achieve. That same approach is also being taken in the areas of health and law and order. They are state areas of responsibility for which the government keeps cutting the real funding while still expecting the states to do something about them. It is about to do the same, I suspect, with regard to vocational education and training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect worth highlighting in this bill is that it gives the Commonwealth minister power to determine whether states are meeting targets for new trainees rather than leaving that task to the ANTA board.

This bill is a very late response to the decline in apprenticeships and traineeships which has occurred over the past few years. For example, the 1993-94 target of 46,000 apprenticeships is less than half the 1992-93 level. Even if the 1995-96 target of 60,000 new apprenticeships is achieved, that number will be less than the levels achieved four years ago. The question of funding for ANTA is only one aspect that needs to be addressed. The government needs to give ANTA some sense of direction so that it can get on with the job it was established for.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 1994 is largely about funding the Australian National Training Authority in terms of growth funding for the Finn participation targets for young people, funding for off-the-job training provider assistance and funding for an additional 50,000 entry level trainees for the Australian traineeship system and career start traineeships as part of the white paper initiatives. Of course, we realise that business was let off the hook in relation to the changes in the business training levies. That is part of the reason governments now find themselves being required to pay more into training schemes because business is less and less willing to provide research and development and training schemes. Business does not want government regulation but is expecting governments to do more and more for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens will be voting for this bill. We encourage the provision of extra traineeship positions for young people. There is some concern, however, in the traineeship sector that traineeships are being provided in haste and the quality is being sacrificed. The big question, though, is: where are the jobs? Where are the permanent jobs for these people when they train for three to four years and finally qualify as professionals? The government has not addressed this fundamental issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the government would probably turn around and say, `It is through economic growth,' but we do not have to be an Einstein to see that the type of change we have made in many policies in recent times has meant that the type of growth has changed. We are concentrating very much on imported capital which actually sheds jobs. One does not have to be terribly intuitive to see that there is further job shedding within the government sector; at the same time as some positions are being created, unemployment is being created in other areas. In reality, what we do see is a growing number of people in part-time or less tenured positions in short-term jobs. That is, fewer jobs within regions and fewer jobs for younger people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have growing social problems. One does not have to look very far in Western Australia to see that the kind of growth we have is mainly holes in the ground or smokestacks. So we have growth and environmental problems, but they do not necessarily translate to growth in the jobs in the areas where there is the greatest need for employment in our society. Economists recognise also that the tactic of wage subsidies is only useful to the short-term unemployed as an incentive for an employer to take them on. Wage subsidies are not the way to go to help the long-term unemployed. </PARA>

There was a potential under the regional development strategy&mdash;where it was possible to create regional based development and community based development&mdash;to ask people about the real needs of the communities. The whole exercise ended up being a waste of time. All that happened was that two people from the regional development task force went to the major industries and said, `What do you want?' We got more of the same as we have had for a long time. There is a lack of vision by this government about what is needed within a region. It does not ask the right questions of the right people.

If employers are not involved, how can they take on the responsibility for employing people? How do we get them to change their mind-set and inherent bias when it comes to employing the long-term unemployed? Some employers have already been quite vocal in their response to wage subsidies. They have said that it does not matter how many wage subsidies the government throws at them, they will not take on a long-term unemployed person over someone who is short-term unemployed, because of their personal problems, their potential emotional baggage and their deteriorated skills and confidence. We need to do a lot of work to involve employers more in the training process so that there is a smoother transition between the training of marginalised groups and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other obstacles to job creation and one of them is the mind-set of big business. Big business admits to its general house policy of not being interested in creating jobs.

Government is fighting a losing battle by constantly giving sweeteners to big business to try to woo it into establishing its head offices here and offering tax reduction strategies to create jobs.

The culture change is under way and we said that after two years we will review whether the levy will have to be replaced. We hope it does not because we will have the evidence that industry has taken up the challenge for the vocational training of its own staff. The increasing number of smart industries in Australia realise that their most important asset is a well trained staff that is motivated to achieve quality product and quality outcomes in the services they provide to their consumers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 and three other equally important bills: the National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994, the Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994, and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These four pieces of legislation span a range of primary industries and, taken together, demonstrate an admirable commitment to self-help. The National Residue Survey Administration (Meat Chickens) Amendment Bill 1994 provides for the maximum rate of the national residue survey levy to increase from 0.02c a head to 0.06c a head. Almost all primary industries in Australia contribute to the national residue survey to ensure that the food they produce is free from harmful residues. The survey for each industry is fully funded by that industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, the Australian Chickenmeat Federation sought an increase in the levy to provide the industry with greater flexibility in long-term planning. The chicken meat industry has developed from so-called backyard status in the late 1960s to a modern, dynamic industry, now second only to beef in terms of meat production. Some 40 years ago, Australians consumed about three million birds annually, or less than half a kilogram of chicken meat per person, per year. In 1993-94, Australians ate their way through 325 million birds. That equates to two Kentucky Fried Chicken snack packs or three Mc Chickens, or perhaps 13 bowls of chicken noodle soup per person, per week, per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the chicken meat industry in Australia directly employs 16,000 people, indirectly involves 45,000 people and has retail sales figures approaching $1.7 billion. Having said that, there is mounting concern about the impact of the drought on intensive animal feeding industries which rely on grain. The chicken meat industry is a prime example. Should grain prices continue to rise, the industry will have to decide whether to absorb the extra costs or pass them on to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the impacts of this drought go beyond the farm gate. Our chicken meat industry is also hamstrung by the high cost of capital, the high cost of labour, and the subsidies provided in rival countries. The United States and the European Union are aggressive protectors of their domestic chicken meat industries, while Thailand has rapidly become a major chicken meat exporter, through tax incentives and cheap labour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of these reasons, the possible relaxation of Australian quarantine regulations relating to imported chicken meat causes great concern to the Australian industry. This concern is twofold: first, the impact on local producers, and second, the possible introduction of the world's most feared disease in the poultry industry&mdash;the newcastle virus. I am pleased that AQIS has decided against allowing raw chicken meat into Australia and I trust that its position paper, which suggests cooked chicken meat will not pose a disease risk, is correct. The chicken meat industry upholds high standards and, on behalf of the federal coalition, I hope the industry's commitment to the future is matched by the same level of commitment from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Wine Grapes Levy Amendment Bill 1994 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges (Wine Grapes) Collection Amendment Bill 1994 propose to end the current levy exemption for wine producers producing less than 10 tonnes of fresh grapes; place a maximum limit on the amount of levy that is used to support marketing; and increase the limit on research and development component. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the money raised through the wine grapes levy finances the operations of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation&mdash;the body responsible for wine promotion; administration of the wine label integrity program; export control; and determining Australia's geographical indications for use in describing and presenting wine. The remainder funds the Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation. Funding spent on research is matched by the government on a dollar-for-dollar basis. The Australian Wine Makers Forum and the Independent Winemakers&mdash;both representing small winemakers&mdash;support the changes proposed by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the reputation of Australian wine grows throughout the world, our export trade continues to strengthen. In 1994-95, it is estimated that we will export 162 million litres of wine. This amounts to an increase of almost 400 per cent since 1989-90. In value terms, exports are expected to come close to $500 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most recent developments in the wine industry has been the agreement reached between Australia and the European Community signed in January this year. The agreement paves the way for improved access of Australian wines to European markets and eliminates technical trade barriers in return for the phasing out of European geographical names as names for wine. The search for new names to replace beaujolais, hock, madeira, chianti and, eventually, champagne, chablis, moselle and others will be a challenge for Australian winemakers. But it does provide an enormous opportunity for Australian wines to further establish their market niche with distinctive names. Given the industry's vision and foresight, the federal coalition has no doubt that the industry will achieve its $1 billion annual export targets by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final piece of legislation in this cognate debate, the Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994, covers a range of minor changes to various primary industry acts. These include the Farm Household Support Act 1992, the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Policy Council Act 1984 and the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. The Farm Household Support Act, for example, covers the operation of the farm household support scheme designed to provide assistance to farmers unable to meet living expenses or to access commercial finance. This assistance is provided for a period of nine months. If, during that time, the farmer leaves the farm the assistance becomes a grant. If the farmer remains in the industry, the assistance must be repaid at commercial interest rates. Those who leave the industry within the nine-month period will receive the balance payable for a period as a lump sum in addition to their re-establishment grant of $45,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill makes a small but important change to the administrative arrangements for farm household support. It extends from 14 to 30 days the time allowed for farm household support applicants to obtain a certificate of inability to access finance. Many farmers have experienced problems in obtaining such a certificate within 14 days because of the difficulty in physically accessing financial institutions. So I am pleased that the government has acknowledged this difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the household support scheme is, in theory, a useful form of assistance to farmers in difficulty, in practice it has not worked and only some 260 farmers currently receive benefits. For this reason, the government has been forced to introduce the drought relief payment in order to put food on the tables of drought stricken farmers. We will later today be dealing with that legislation comprehensively. As I said earlier, the consequences of this drought go beyond the farm gate. They impact on small businesses in country towns, and on the people who work for those small businesses. It is evident that Australia will bear the high personal and economic costs of this drought for many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further amendments contained in this bill, which I understand are being made at the request of the AWRAP management, would provide the organisation with greater flexibility in the way in which it allocates its funds. More specifically, it would be able to direct moneys received from patents and trademarks to activities other than research and development. The Democrats will be supporting these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the Farm Household Support Act. The explanatory memorandum states that the purpose of the amendments is to improve the delivery of farm household support to farmers experiencing financial difficulties and to allow for the more efficient administration of farm household support. Experience I have had with social security legislation has made me very wary when an explanatory memorandum uses terms like `improve the delivery' or `allow for more efficient administration'. Often these terms seem to be `draftese' for measures which leave a lot of people worse off. Fortunately, after we have gone carefully through the amendments to the Farm Household Support Act it does not seem that there would be too many in a worse situation. We are thankful for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the amendments would allow farmers more time to obtain a certificate verifying that they are unable to access any further commercial finance. This extension from 14 to 30 days would be useful because of the problems many farmers have in simply getting time to travel into town to a financial institution. Those problems are exacerbated by the fact that financial institutions have been exiting the bush almost as fast as some farmers. Secondly, the act currently provides that, where a person is attempting to sell his or her farm but is having difficulty doing so, the secretary or a delegate can extend the grant period of farm household support beyond the normal nine-month limit. Amendments in this bill would allow recipients who have been refused an extension of their grant period to ask for a review of that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A third amendment in the bill would ensure that a farmer can access the nine-month grant period of farm household support only once. In other words, a farmer who sold up and received a lump sum payout of the grant period would not, if he or she should subsequently re-enter farming, be eligible for a second grant period. The final amendment in the bill is one I want to talk about at slightly greater length. It would require people with farm household support loans to inform the Department of Primary Industries and Energy if they change their address, sell their farm or have some change in their financial position which may affect their capacity to repay the loan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments set out also that the penalty for failing to provide this information would be imprisonment for six months, which the explanatory memorandum says is consistent with similar penalties in the Social Security Act. I note that many of the clauses in the Social Security Act relating to imprisonment have an accompanying note which says that a court can, if it wishes, impose an appropriate fine instead of a term of imprisonment. I am interested to know if similar flexibility is available under the imprisonment clause contained within this bill. Prison terms, surely, should be a last option. Perhaps the minister would like to comment on this provision in his response to this debate. I ask him to note that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One final comment I would like to make about farm household support is that the Democrats have always been concerned that this payment is made as a loan and not as a straight-out grant. In the House of Representatives debate the member for Maranoa, Mr Bruce Scott, made the very good point that the last thing that people who have exhausted every source of commercial credit available to them need is another loan hanging over their heads. Of course, given that the chances of being able to sell a drought stricken farming property are pretty slim, that is exactly what they end up with&mdash;a loan accruing interest at commercial rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the object of the farm household support payments is solely to cover day-to-day living expenses for farm families who have no money whatsoever, and no capacity to borrow from any sort of financial institution, I believe they should be made as a grant. When it was first introduced in 1992, my colleague Senator Lees criticised the loan aspect of the scheme when she said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Basically, this amounts to the Government making money out of alleviating poverty.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely that is an obscenity. She continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To make it clear, we are talking about farmers who need a payment to put food on the table, but may end up after two years with a debt of some $20,000.</PARA>
<PARA>The two-year limit, for those farmers who qualified when the scheme was first introduced, will expire early next year at which time they will begin to be charged interest and will have to start making repayments. What we are talking about here is some of Australia's worst-off farmers being penalised for not selling up and getting out of farming altogether. With conditions in rural Australia the way they currently are, most farmers would be lucky to give their farms away, let alone sell them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet in March next year we are going to see people having to repay a debt to the Commonwealth&mdash;a debt accumulated while those people were basically living in poverty, and a debt on which the Commonwealth is going to charge a commercial interest rate. I simply reiterate that the Democrats believe that, since the object of farm household support payments is solely to cover day-to-day living expenses, they should be made as a grant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to comment for long given the time and some albeit critical comments. The Primary Industries and Energy Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 is an omnibus bill which gives the opportunity for senators to make fairly wide ranging contributions. The bill goes to amendments in relation to the Wine and Brandy Corporation members of which, I should mention, I was fortunate to have dinner with last night at one of their meetings in Canberra. I think that corporation, together with the research organisation, are doing a fine job in assisting the exports of wine and meeting the $1 billion target.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I just mention a particular problem that the export of wine has caused. Unfortunately, the dried fruit industry has been a victim of the wine industry's success. I talked to some dried fruit growers and packers in Mildura on Monday during my visit to that city. Unfortunately, many of the grapes that are required for dried fruit production are going to wine production. Clearly, that is a supply and demand situation&mdash;the better price being offered by the wine industry. The unfortunate aspect of that is that the dried fruits industry is not able to supply the market. The dried fruits industry has been a fine example of a very successful and innovative industry, particularly over the last decade when it faced significant competition in the form of cheap dried vine fruit from countries such as Turkey and Iran, where labour is obviously much less expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An interesting aspect of the dried vine fruit industry is that it has met that competition by innovative technology. In the technology that I have looked at, every individual piece of dried vine fruit&mdash;every piece of sultana&mdash;that is packaged is individually scanned, cleaned, sized and colour coded. I think there are a million and a half pieces of fruit in one tonne of fruit so it gives us some idea of the sort of technology required to do that. Because of that type of technology, the industry has been able to maintain its market and defeat imports, not just in Australia but also in Europe&mdash;primarily Germany. Until this year, Australia was the largest dried vine fruit exporter in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an interesting issue because it highlights the fact that the basis of success for rural industries is not in maintaining high tariff protection. There may be some industries where tariff protection at times is necessary, but at the end of the day the dried vine fruit industry has defeated the competition by technology and by innovative marketing. It is the most successful industry of its type in the world. As I said, it is an unfortunate downside of the wine industry's success that it cannot obtain the grapes now to export and meet its export markets. I notice Senator Lees has just come in. She may want to comment on the legislation. I will leave my remarks there. I thank senators for their contributions. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, these bills seek to end the levy exemption for Australia's small wine producers, or those who are processing less than 10 tonnes of grapes. In the past, the small producers have effectively paid the levy through the costs passed on to them by the larger producers so eventually the money has filtered through the system somehow. However, they have not been recognised as official levy payers and therefore have not been entitled to become involved in the activities of the Wine and Brandy Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's changes mean that the small wine producers as official levy payers will now be able to access the marketing, labelling, and research and development activities of the corporation. They will also get a vote at the corporation's annual general meeting. Australia's wine industry supports the changes implemented by these bills, therefore the Democrats will obviously have no problems in supporting these bills as they stand. They provide significant recognition for small wine producers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Drought Relief Payment Bill is the federal government's belated response to the drought which has ravaged so much of Queensland and New South Wales for the past four years. I am concerned that this legislation, like so many other primary industry bills, is cobbled together for passage through this parliament but really does not do justice to that important industry, the primary industry. It is a pity that we see primary industry bills hastened through on the last day of a sitting week, usually in a manner that frustrates the program. It is a pity that we have to deal with this bill in such a manner again today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill acknowledges the hardship faced by farmers in exceptional circumstances due to drought, by offering a new welfare payment called the drought relief payment. I understand that the DRP will be subject to the income and off-farm assets tests that apply to jobsearch and will be on the same scale as the jobsearch allowance. The federal coalition welcomes the drought relief payment and, in particular, the government's decision to exclude consideration of farm assets, life insurance and superannuation when DRP rate calculations are being made. For some time the federal coalition has called on the federal government to lift the assets tests in times of severe economic hardship. We are pleased that the government has seen the light. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the federal coalition is keen to expedite this legislation through parliament, we want to place on record our concerns and our criticisms. For a start, we are at a loss to understand why the government has taken so long to recognise the plight of drought stricken farmers in this country. Similarly, we are disappointed that the government has ignored the consequences of the drought for our important small business sector. It is a matter of record that the government was forced into announcing this package by pressure from opposition members of parliament and through the power of the media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once Australians realised the extent of the drought, the fact that there was a real crisis on the land, the government had to act. But not before the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, had arrogantly dismissed the drought as something farmers had to live with. `Look,' he said, `It's always out there. Farmers have just got to learn to manage it.' The reality is that farmers are ill-equipped to cope with such severe droughts, particularly in the current economic circumstances. It is worth repeating that small businesses, particularly those dependent on the rural sector, are hurting and have been forgotten by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague the shadow minister for primary industry, Mr John Anderson, said in the other place this week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Machinery agents probably start to hurt before most farmers do. In anticipation of tough times, farmers close the cheque books early. Many of the machinery agents out there, who are an absolutely vital part of the farm infrastructure of this nation, have long since folded. I do not know how some of them keep going under the current circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>He added that everyone from fuel agents and contractors to the corner store operator were feeling the pain. It was therefore incumbent on the government to acknowledge the full impact of the drought on rural Australia. My colleagues and I believe in a three-tiered approach to severe drought. First, the adequate delivery of welfare provisions; second, the retention of farms and farm assets; and third, recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought is not just a welfare issue. It is also an economic issue. The farm sector is extraordinarily important to Australia providing a quarter of our export dollars. Hopefully, that figure will improve, once the drought breaks and we take advantage of rising commodity prices and expanding export opportunities to Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our farm sector also provides enormous opportunities for employment not only at the base farm production level but also in the food processing sector, which employs some 200,000 people. The government has acknowledged the need to establish new mechanisms to ensure that the farm sector is able to recover and plan for the future once good rains come. Those plans must include preparations&mdash;such as commitments to income equalisation deposits and farm management bonds&mdash;to help farmers prepare for the next downturn. Again, that has long been federal coalition policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must not forget that the farm sector is as much a victim of the drought as it is a victim of Labor's failed economic policies. Our farmers have suffered years of farm inflation&mdash;sometimes two and three times that of their overseas competitors&mdash;while sending 70 or 80 per cent of their agricultural product abroad. The fact is we are price takers on international markets. So, when our competitiveness is gutted by high domestic prices and ever-rising costs, farmers&mdash;not the government&mdash;make up the difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last decade or so, high inflation rates have been accompanied by high interest rates which at one stage exceeded 20 per cent for 18 months. The damage done to the farm sector, at a time of historically low commodity prices, was immense and incalculable. It left farmers, in net terms, with a debt load of about $17.3 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now witnessing the end result of a decade of federal Labor government&mdash;that is, a financially weakened and vulnerable farm sector. Given the financial hardships faced by farmers in the 1980s, they have been unable to prepare themselves for a modest downturn, let alone a severe drought such as this one. Also relevant to the drought debate is the government's refusal to grapple with the problem of high cost imposts, post-farm gate. Report after report has made it clear that the Australian beef industry is disadvantaged by the high costs involved in processing beef in this country compared with our competitors, New Zealand, Argentina or the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest report, released six weeks ago, explains why our producers are internationally competitive: they take a lower return at the farm gate. Farmers are still bearing the brunt of the federal government's decision that the farm sector should face a level playing field, ahead of anyone else. As a nation, we need to address the problem of post-drought reconstruction and, as far as possible, prevent our best farmers from going under. Clearly, the government agrees with the federal coalition on this point. It has picked up one of our rural assistance policy commitments: that the maximum allowable assistance with interest rates be significantly upgraded from $50,000 a year to $100,000 or $300,000 over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also picked up our policy to extend relief beyond the end of the drought. That extra time will allow farmers, farm leaders, lenders and governments to negotiate ways of reconstructing debt loads. Now that the government is committed to post-drought assistance, it is not unreasonable to ask lenders to offer a similar long-term commitment to farmers. To that end, the coalition has set up a shadow ministry subcommittee to investigate this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the severity and rapidity of the drought caught many by surprise, I would like to remind the Senate of comments made by the shadow minister for primary industry last year. Speaking in the other place, Mr Anderson warned that a severe drought was emerging in parts of Queensland&mdash;a situation so serious that it demanded food parcels and donations from charitable organisations. He also highlighted the growing human tragedy: the strain on farmers and on their families as they struggled to hold on to drought stricken properties. That was May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, more than a year later, the government has bowed to public and parliamentary pressure and announced a drought relief package. It is worth noting the comments of the President of the New South Wales Farmers Association at a drought meeting in Sydney this week. Mr John Crawford put the crisis in historical context when he said that New South Wales was facing its worst drought in 50 years, and that many farmers were killing their breeding stock. Given the severity of the drought&mdash;and the anomalies in the existing guidelines&mdash;it is clear that new mechanisms need to be developed in order to better identify areas of greatest need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, there are enormous needs in the Scone, Maryvale, and Mudgee areas, which have somehow been excluded from the list of exceptional drought areas. Those farmers face extraordinarily difficult circumstances yet, under the current rigid guidelines, may have to wait many months before receiving assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In winding up, I would like to reiterate the federal coalition's concern about the devastating effects of severe drought on the small business sector, as well as the farm sector. Small businesses in badly affected areas have experienced a severe and sustained downturn in trade, with a corresponding reduction in income and, what we all have to acknowledge, the threat and constant problem of rising interest rates. We need to ensure their survival. After all, small businesses have substantial investments in assets and expertise which will be crucial to reconstruction after the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal coalition has called on the federal government to return severe drought to the national disaster relief arrangements. This would provide a mechanism for assisting small businesses where currently no mechanism exists. Overall, the federal coalition welcomes the initiatives in this legislation, and is pleased to support the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meeting of 29 November was not a final decision meeting; it was a meeting between senior ministers to establish what a common view would be. Having established that common view, each of the relevant ministers would then give instructions to their departments; a cabinet submission would be drawn up; that would be considered by cabinet; the opposition leader and defence spokesman would be consulted; the caucus would be consulted; and a statement delivered in parliament. That is the process. So the meeting on 29 November was not a meeting of a cabinet committee or of a cabinet subcommittee. So in terms of that process, that is why there are not cabinet note takers, and this is a constant process of government. No doubt those on the opposition side, in the long dark memories of when they were last in government, followed a similar process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman asked me whether the Prime Minister's foreign affairs, defence and immigration adviser was present at the meeting on 29 November.

At the time of the first commitment, which was in fact for sanction enforcement, not a question of conflict, the only commitment that we entered into was for two frigates and a supply ship.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction. I was interested to read newspaper reports this week of a survey which claimed that many small businesses had negative perceptions of the government. This result is difficult to reconcile with my own contact with the small business sector, which I have found to be very open-minded and positive about government policy. I observe that the minister said that these results should be viewed with caution. Could the minister inform the Senate on what grounds he reached his conclusion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the Yellow Pages small business index special report. I have already issued a statement saying that it should be treated with some caution. All of us who have any connection with small business realise that the small business community is a pretty robust bunch of people. They usually have a very direct attitude about the government and politicians, whether they are federal, state or local. Many of their complaints, as reflected in this survey, deal with those perceptions. We recognise that those perceptions are strongly held but, despite that, this government has a good working relationship with the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are a couple of reasons why we should view some of the responses with caution. For example, one of the areas in which the small business community disagrees with government policy or has a negative view is taxation&mdash;39 per cent of the respondents mention taxation. Clearly, they want reduced taxation. Twenty-five per cent of the respondents also said that they disagree with the federal government on the so-called absence of incentives for small business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is quite a contradiction. All incentives cost the federal government revenue. Whatever the government provides costs money. If we provide increased incentives, we either have to increase taxation or cut expenditure somewhere else. So there is clearly a contradiction. But it is not unusual for people in the community to say, `Increase taxation elsewhere, but not on me. Give my sector of the community increased government assistance.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I am talking about assistance to the small business sector, I point out that the sectors that have access to the programs announced in the industry part of the Working Nation statement earlier this year have responded very well. The Small Business Coalition&mdash;representing 37 small business organisations&mdash;unanimously welcomed the initiatives in Working Nation, as the initiatives helped small business. I also point out that there have been other surveys recently indicating the health and growth in small business. The Yellow Pages small business index report on industrial relations, released by the very same organisation, showed that nearly a third of employers surveyed took on more staff in the past quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another comprehensive survey with the Australian Bureau of Statistics&mdash;a business expectations survey&mdash;has been developed by the ABS in response to the need for better information on future trading conditions in Australia. The survey is conducted by mail each quarter, and 3,000 representatives of Australian businesses are sampled. That survey showed the expectations for the December quarter 1994 and September quarter 1995. They both showed that the outlook for small business is very good indeed.

It shows the grasp this minister has of his portfolio because he told me in answer to a question on notice two days ago that there were 750 applications, which therefore means that 97 out of every 100 applicants were rejected. Is the minister seriously telling the Senate that persons such as Mr Alevizos and Mr Labbozzetta, preselected Labor Party candidates for the next election, and others appointed because of Senator Bolkus's political patronage and nepotism, were better qualified for appointment than the 730 or thereabouts applicants who were rejected, many of whom had outstanding and highly relevant qualifications?</PARA></TALK.START>

The matter is not as simple as Senator Short portrayed yesterday. The point I make is that every time Senator Short has raised a point about any of the appointments, he has come in with a slanted view, a critically biased view and he has blackguarded reputations. For instance, he mentioned yesterday Pam O'Neil, the person who has been the head of the tribunal since 1989. She has developed a good reputation over that period. Senator Short himself has not criticised her but probably has praised her in the time that he has held the shadow portfolio, and I am sure other shadow ministers have praised her as well.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will be aware, there are now confirmed reports of the withdrawal of Iraqi troops on the border with Kuwait, and the immediate military threat to Kuwait has now clearly passed. But it would be premature to draw any conclusions about longer-term Iraqi intentions and, in that context, the United States, while cautiously acknowledging that Iraqi withdrawal, is continuing to deploy forces in Kuwait. Kuwait itself is continuing its defensive deployments, and the UK, France, and some other members of the Gulf Co-operation Council have also deployed forces there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in this place on Monday, the Australian government does, of course, fully support the statement by the President of the Security Council on 8 October emphasising the necessity for Iraq to fully implement all relevant Security Council resolutions and reaffirming the Security Council's commitment to Kuwait's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Australian government also supports efforts by the United States to implement measures to ensure that Iraq is unable to invade or threaten Kuwait in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also strongly support efforts now under way in the UN Security Council to ensure that Iraq withdraws all its troops which it has moved into the border region to prevent Iraq from threatening its neighbours now or in the future. In that context, the precise form of the Security Council action, whether a resolution or a presidential statement, is still at an early stage of discussion, but measures which are under consideration, if accepted by the council, would preclude reinforcement of the troops that Iraq would be permitted to leave behind and would threaten serious consequences should Iraq not comply.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One possible measure which has been publicly discussed is the imposition of a demilitarised zone, also referred to as a no-drive or a no-tank zone, south of the 32nd parallel, 230 kilometres from the Iraq-Kuwait border. The implications, I have to say, of such a measure would need careful consideration as there has to be a clear perception by Security Council decision makers, even if this is not made fully public at the time, as to what actually happens next in the event of such measures of prevention actually failing&mdash;the trip wire being crossed, in other words.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second part of Senator Loosley's question, I am aware of UNICEF's report detailing the appalling humanitarian situation facing the people of Iraq, but it needs to be appreciated that Iraq is already permitted under the terms of UN Security Council resolutions 706 and 712, passed in 1991, to sell oil to an amount of $US1.6 billion over a six-month period, of which 30 per cent has to be available for humanitarian relief. But the Iraqi government has chosen not to exercise that option. It has always been within the Iraqi government's capacity to comply not only with that oil-for-food resolution but also with the relevant UN Security Council resolutions that would lead to a lifting of all sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility for the situation in which Iraq now finds itself is, therefore, entirely and unequivocally that of Saddam Hussein. That said, one's heart does still, of course, go out to those ordinary people of the country who are victims of this appalling man's intransigence. In that sense, I should also point out that we in Australia have contributed $3.6 million in emergency food aid to Iraq. This included $700,000 given to the non-governmental organisation CARE in November last year for emergency food aid for the needy and particularly for children.</PARA>

To put that in perspective, usually we get about 20. Our initial target, which we thought would be a great success for CeBit 95, was 65. We had to increase that to 122. We now have 130. It is not a problem beyond resolution; and the problem of succeeding too well is a very nice problem to have.

Telecommunications equipment has been associated with some of the trade missions that I have taken away. There have been successful sales in Latin America and in many of the countries of Asia. We have also succeeded in some of the other competitive markets around the world. There are good prospects if the Japanese market opens, as we hope it will, that we will do well in Japan.

Of course, it is speculative, but Austrade's estimate at the moment is that our presence at the fair, based on claims of previous participants, could conservatively result in an extra $200 million in export earnings for participating companies. Previous individual participants have claimed to have each gained between $1 million and $2 million worth of business. So we can see from the level of participation, and the previous history of success, that about $200 million in extra export earnings is a reasonable expectation. That is not a bad return on taxpayers' money when we realise that it will cost Austrade $2.8 million to participate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government remains committed to our national and international targets. It is true that the recently released greenhouse gas inventory confirms that, with the current measures in place, Australia is only a little over halfway towards achieving stabilisation of emissions in the year 2000. A coordinated effort involving all the key government agencies is currently under way to address the shortfall in greenhouse gas abatement. In December of this year, cabinet will be considering the second phase of Australia's domestic response to greenhouse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate this process there are a number of interdepartmental working groups at the Commonwealth level developing a range of possible policy options for consideration by cabinet. In addition to that, a task force of Commonwealth and state officials will be examining how the  states might contribute to additional action. Furthermore, to ensure that the community at large has an opportunity to contribute to this important process, we will be asking for input from our national greenhouse advisory panel. Community stakeholders can coordinate contributions and input through the panel.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the recent decisions of ANZMEC on national minimum energy performance standards, which Senator Margetts asked me about, these matters obviously are the domain of my colleague Senator Collins, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. I suggest to Senator Margetts that any detailed questions in relation to those matters be referred to Senator Collins. My understanding of the ANZMEC meeting is that national minimum energy performance standards for refrigerators, freezers and electric storage hot water heaters were not rejected at that meeting. I think ministers agreed to communicate with each other again on the matter, following discussions with both the industry and consumer groups.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my view, the national energy performance standards are a very important part of our greenhouse response and they certainly should be implemented as soon as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction (Senator Schacht), to a question without notice asked by Senator Jones this day, relating to the Torres Strait Islands border.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Schacht obviously wrote the question for Senator Jones, and he could not even get the question right, let alone the answer. Senator Schacht has shot off his mouth yet again and made an absolute fool of himself, an absolute and unmitigated fool of himself, and it is no wonder the South Australian Labor Party wants to get rid of him off the ticket. He is an embarrassment to the government, to this chamber, to the parliament and to the Labor Party in South Australia, and I can well agree with even that miserable lot that want to get rid of Senator Schacht. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Schacht has crawled back in here and conceded&mdash;he did not have the grace to apologise for that&mdash;I did in fact write to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) on 4 October explaining exactly my concerns. I will seek leave to incorporate this letter or a copy of it. In the last paragraph, I say to the Attorney-General:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well I would think that some of the concerns I raise in this letter would be matters more appropriately dealt with by other Commonwealth Government Departments but rather than me forward copies of this letter to other Ministers I would appreciate if your staff could arrange to forward a copy of the letter to any Minister with relevant responsibilities who may be able to assist in finding solutions to the problems which are raised with me by constituents.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Schacht says that there are plenty of people there to look after what everybody in the territory knows is a gross, illegal trade which is continuing. There are people coming from New Guinea through the Torres Strait islands into Horn Island, flying to Cairns. As I said on TV, I can identify the person that people raised with me. They tell me it is a man in a red hat, that they do not know his name, but they see him coming down regularly. In a small town like Thursday Island, if everybody can identify him it should not require any great investigative work by the Federal Police or Customs officers to find that person and do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have written to the Attorney-General; I have written, through him, to Senator Schacht, who is too incompetent and lazy to know about it; I have written to the Queensland police minister and others drawing to their attention my genuine concerns raised with my by constituents who have very genuine concerns about this illegal traffic. It is not just the drugs and the traffic of people, but there are very dangerous diseases in plant and animals in Asia and New Guinea. They only have to get into Cairns on the leaves of some of these marijuana plants and we have a major problem on our hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht says that the Customs people are doing a great job and that there are plenty of people there. Let me tell Senator Schacht what the National Director of the Board of Management of the Australian Customs Service, Les Jones, is quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Bulletin</EMPHASIS> as saying. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The task faced by customs officers in the region was daunting.</PARA>
<PARA>And so it is. Again quoting Mr Jones, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are seven staff there.</PARA>
<PARA>People who know the Torres Strait, know the number of islands in it, know how close it is to New Guinea&mdash;one of the islands of the Torres Strait, part of Australia, is only a couple of kilometres from the mainland of New Guinea&mdash;would know how difficult it is to police and would know that we need more people. Senator Schacht says, `We have plenty of people up on the border.' There are seven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell senators how many Customs officers there are in the whole of Queensland. There are 577. There are 4,372 in the whole of Australia. But on our doorstep, where people can get in a tinny, a little aluminium boat, to come across, how many do we have? We have the great number of seven&mdash;seven out of 4,000 officers&mdash;and Senator Schacht says it is all okay. It is a major problem which is why I, with all responsibility, wrote to the Attorney-General and wrote to the Queensland minister. Then Senator Schacht accuses me here of not even raising the matter. He is a dill and a buffoon. It is a wonder that Mr Keating leaves him there&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Colston)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Order! You will withdraw that comment, which was quite unparliamentary. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, in deference to your ruling, I withdraw it. But Senator Schacht is incompetent. It amazes me&mdash;and most of his colleagues&mdash;that Mr Keating leaves him on the front bench. He has made an absolute fool of himself, not only in this instance but in every instance possible. He is a complete embarrassment to this parliament&mdash;certainly to the government. I think the least Senator Schacht could do would be to tender an apology for the disgraceful attack he made. I seek leave to have that letter incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Attorney,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On Thursday Island recently a number of constituents, many of whom are community and civic leaders, raised with me the problem of an apparent break down of law and order in Thursday Island, which they claim is evidenced by an increasing number of major robberies and break and enters and violent assaults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These matters are principally matters for the Queensland Government and the Queensland Police Force but they do have a Federal element.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is indicated to me that a lot of the stolen goods turn up in New Guinea and there is a belief held by many varied people that the increase in crime is directly related to the purchase and transportation of drugs from New Guinea, through the Torres Strait Islands and into mainland Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware of Treaty conditions we have with Papua New Guinea which allow for movement by Papua New Guinea nationals into the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed however that there is a regular traffic of people and goods into mainland Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously I am not in a position to do more than pass on concerns raised with me by constituents and I have no information which would enable police to take action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is however told to me that "everybody knows what is happening and the people involved" and it would seem to me that trained investigators would have little difficulty in gathering the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am told that occasionally the Federal Police do mount undercover operations in the islands but these seem to be a bit of a joke as most of the locals know two to three weeks before these operations occur that there will be undercover police in town and apparently they are readily identifiable when they arrive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is the additional matter of health and quarantine concerns on any plant material brought from Papua New Guinea into Australia. You will well appreciate that one of the disasters which Australia is not equipped fully to deal with would be an outbreak of some form of plant or animal disease from Asia and the North.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware of what arrangements you have with the Queensland Government in relation to policing the frontiers of our country in the Torres Strait nor if there is any permanent Federal Police presence in the islands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding is that there is no regular and permanent Federal Police presence and I would be grateful if you could have one of your officers write to me to explain the arrangements and why there are no Federal Police in the area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware that there is a Customs presence but the locals again tell me that the numbers of customs people are grossly inadequate for the huge tasks involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I enclose a copy of the letter I am writing to the Queensland Minister for Police about the same issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well I would think that some of the concerns I raise in this letter would be matters more appropriately dealt with by other Commonwealth Government Departments but rather than me forward the copies of this letter to other Ministers I would appreciate if your staff could arrange to forward a copy of the letter to any Minister with the relevant responsibilities who may be able to assist in finding solutions for the problems which are raised with me by constituents.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ian Macdonald said that they could identify a man with a red hat. I must say that this is the most extraordinary explanation I have heard in the Senate for a long time. Senator Macdonald does not have a red hat but a red face for trying to explain the contradiction in what he said on North Queensland Television on 29 September. He said in his interview:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do have descriptions of the type of people who are doing it and the descriptions of an actual person involved. And certainly I'd be making the authorities aware of those things that have been told to me.</PARA>
<PARA>In the letter he has just incorporated, all he says is, `I have no information which would enable police to take action.' All he has said is that it was a man with a red hat. This is extraordinary. He is running around North Queensland, bagging the Australian Customs Service and the Australian government, saying that he can identify one individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He writes to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) saying that he has no information&mdash;that is in his letter&mdash;and then he says in this chamber that it was a man with a red hat. What an extraordinary comic opera he is performing. What he has been caught out on is seeking publicity in North Queensland for his own political motives&mdash;probably his Liberal Party preselection in particular. When he wrote to the Attorney-General, the letter he has incorporated, he said that he could not give any evidence. I think Senator Macdonald is the one who has been caught out and I thank him for tabling that letter to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is really unusual that Senator Macdonald would write a letter of such importance and simply ask the Attorney-General to pass it on to any other relevant minister when he knew that I am the Customs minister and when, as I understand it, there is a Customs office just around the corner from his own electorate office. One would have thought that he could have at least made an effort to write to me or raise the issue with me during the past two weeks, but he did not&mdash;he raised it with the Attorney-General. The reason Senator Macdonald did not want to raise it with me is obvious: he had no information. He has been caught out in a publicity stunt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue Senator Macdonald raised was the resources of the ACS in the Torres Strait. Yes, it is true that there are seven officers. Of course, he did not mention the contract officers we employ under Coastwatch who operate in the Torres Strait and who add to the resources of Customs. That area is the main area of surveillance. It has been upgraded in the recent new contract for Coastwatch that the ACS has just let to a North Queensland helicopter company. I am sure Senator Macdonald would be very pleased to hear that we are employing a local company to provide specialised surveillance of the Torres Strait. That company has been very appreciative of the fact that the Australian Customs Service, through proper procedures, was able to give that contract to a North Queensland company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true, as I said in my answer, that I would never claim a 100 per cent ability to stop the illegal importation of drugs into Australia. With our coastline of over 20,000 kilometres, much of it uninhabited, it is extremely difficult to guarantee that. In conjunction with other authorities and other services, we make the best effort that we can to stop the illegal importation of drugs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are quite open about our successes. I have mentioned the fact that last year, compared with the previous year, there were fewer seizures, which is one way of describing it. But in recent months we have had some spectacular seizures, including some in Queensland. I think Senator Macdonald should give credit to the officers of Customs and the Australian Federal Police for their success in making those seizures and in protecting our border from illegal drugs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator McGauran this day, relating to water conservation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think my comments might be helpful to the government because there is a bit of a problem. I want to make sure that farmers get the full benefit of the government's intent because there are a few little slippages in terms of what was said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is the application of the investment allowance to water conservation projects. I refer to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of 21 September in which he said that the government will provide incentives for farmers `to better protect the agricultural resource base during drought and encourage improved land management'. In particular, the government will consider providing a generous investment allowance for farm storage and water facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that the present income tax investment allowance remains in effect for units of property for which  contracts of acquisition were entered into or for which construction commenced prior to 1 July 1994, if those units are installed and ready for use prior to 1 July 1995. It applies expressly to a range of structural improvements, on land used for the purpose of carrying on a business of primary production, for the purpose of conserving water or such improvements for the purpose of conveying water. The section involved is 82AE(b)(iv) and (v). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of my raising the matter in response to the minister's answer is that there is a problem with this provision and I think it has not been clearly understood. Section 82AM states that the investment allowance is not allowable for expenditure incurred in respect of a unit of property if a deduction is allowable under section 75B of the act. Section 75B covers all of the items listed in section 82AE(b)(iv) and (v), so it appears that either, firstly, the reference to section 75B in section 82AM is a drafting error and ought to be amended so that there is no doubt&mdash;and this is the point&mdash;that those farmers who invested in dams, wells or irrigation qualify for the investment allowance; or, secondly, the policy of the government is to deny the investment allowance for expenditure on conserving and conveying water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe this is the case, but it is certainly a matter that needs to be passed on to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) because I think the position as to these two alternatives needs to be clarified. I certainly hope that farmers will be able to get the full benefit of what I think was intended because there are certain restrictions in terms of the current wording of the Income Tax Assessment Act in relation to the investment allowance. I ask the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, who is at the table, to pass that information on to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister so that the farmers involved can get the full benefit, which I think was intended, arising from the problems with the drought, in terms of the availability of the investment allowance. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Cooney</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your Committee's Interim Report on the provisions of the Evidence Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's first recommendation was that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`matters noted [in the Report] be addressed by the government as soon as possible after appropriate consultation between the governments of the Commonwealth and New South Wales.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has acted on this recommendation. All the matters listed in the Committee's report have been examined by the Government in consultation with the New South Wales Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government amendments will be moved to the Bill relating to some of the matters mentioned in the Report, and to some other matters. These amendments have been developed in consultation with New South Wales. The Attorney-General for New South Wales, the Hon John Hannaford MLC, has advised me that he has examined the proposed amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hannaford referred to 2 specific matters in his letter: the commencement date and the test for legal professional privilege. Otherwise Mr Hannaford said that he has `no in-principle objection to these matters. However, I also note that my concurrence is subject to final Cabinet approval of the proposed amendments'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An indicative list of the proposed amendments is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In his letter, Mr Hannaford expressed a firm preference for the dominant purpose test for legal professional privilege. Mr Hannaford said `Although any divergence between the State and Commonwealth Bills would of course detract from the goal of uniformity, I am strongly of the view that a `dominant purpose' test would be more appropriate for New South Wales.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe strongly that the current sole purpose test is appropriate. Accordingly, this appears to be an area where complete uniformity is not possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's second recommendation was that</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`there be a period of at least six months between the passing of the Bill and its coming into operation to enable the legal community to familiarise itself with the Bill's provisions.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes that there should be a substantial period between passage of the Bill and its coming into force. It had originally hoped that the Bill would be passed in time for a period of 6 months to elapse before its commencement. However, the Government does not believe that the period before commencement need be as long as 6 months, especially since the Bill has been around for so long.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, the Government proposes to move an amendment to the Bill to substitute `18 April 1995' for `1 January 1995' in the commencement provision. This will provide for a 6 month period if the Bill can be considered by the Parliament promptly. This date has the advantages of providing an appropriate period after passage and of being after a break (Easter) in the sitting of the courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the commencement date, Mr Hannaford said</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`Ideally, I would prefer a joint proclamation date for both Bills. Passage of the New South Wales Bill, however, is subject to the State Cabinet and Parliamentary processes and as such may not take place by the proposed date. In such circumstances, and bearing in mind the lengthy and extensive amount of preparation involved with this Bill, a separate Commonwealth commencement date of 18 April 1995 may become appropriate.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hannaford`s comment reflects the fact that it would not be possible to do more than table a NSW Bill before the NSW Parliament rises this year, and the NSW Parliament will no doubt not resume until some time after the NSW election on 25 May 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's third recommendation was that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">`the legislation should be monitored after its enactment. This monitoring should be undertaken by a panel comprising representatives of relevant courts, legal practitioners and the Attorney-General's Department. The Committee will invite members of this monitoring panel to appear before the Committee in 1995 to report on any problems encountered following the implementation of the legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New South Wales, the Australian Capital Territory and some courts have been consulted about the Committee's recommendation and the issue of monitoring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with this recommendation in principle. Subject to consultation with the courts and the legal profession about their participation, the Government hopes to have the necessary arrangements relating to the proposed committee complete before the legislation comes into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will also be coordinating monitoring arrangements with those in New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Coulter</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THIRD REPORT OF THE SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE FUNCTIONS, POWERS AND OPERATION OF THE AUSTRALIAN LOAN COUNCIL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to you to respond to the recommendations of the Third Report of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made six recommendations which concern the nature of the Loan Council and the presentation of the financial information relevant to its operation. The key recommendations were directed towards accountability and disclosure of information. In recommendation Three it was proposed that the uniform reporting requirements established by Loan Council should include auditors' reports. Recommendation Five proposed that annual reports be presented to Parliaments including a consolidated, audited report by the Loan Council to the Commonwealth Parliament. In recommendation Six it was proposed that these arrangements should be made legally binding requirements on the Commonwealth and the State and Territory Governments by virtue of an amendment to the Financial Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware, a significant reform of the Financial Agreement was formally concluded at the Council of Australian Governments meeting in February of this year. The signing of the new Financial Agreement was the culmination of a consultative process that took place over a number of years. The Financial Agreement Bill 1994 and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994 which will give effect to this reform were passed by the Commonwealth Parliament in June this year. The States and Territories have also been playing their part in bringing this work to fruition. Legislation has also been passed by Victoria, the ACT and the Northern Territory. In the other States complementary legislation to that passed by the Commonwealth Parliament has either received Cabinet consideration or has been introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revised Financial Agreement will give effect to Recommendation One of the Committee's recommendations which favoured the continuation of the Loan Council. The Commonwealth Government is of the view that there will continue to be a role for the Loan Council in the coordination and disclosure of financial matters for the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of the other key recommendations by the Senate Committee, I should say that the Commonwealth Government has no difficulty, in principle, with the idea that the Loan Council Allocation or the Statement of Financial Assets and Liabilities that the Commonwealth is to submit to the Loan Council should be open to ready scrutiny by the Auditor-General and the Parliament. The current powers of the Auditor-General provide scope for the Auditor-General to look at this area and the Loan Council Allocation has been reported to the Parliament in Budget Paper No 3 and, more recently, in the Final Budget Outcome 1993-94 document tabled in the Parliament at the start of the current sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic thrust of the arrangements which have been developed by the Loan Council in recent years has been to emphasise the provision of comprehensive information about the public sector's need for funds to the public and to the financial markets. In the `Future Arrangements for Loan Council Monitoring and Reporting' adopted by the Loan Council on 5 July 1993 Loan Council noted that the Auditors-General of the various jurisdictions would fulfil their usual roles in relation to each jurisdiction's financial statements. That is, Auditors-General would continue, within their powers, to audit and report on the financial transactions of governments including, where relevant, those relating to a jurisdiction's Loan Council Allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government is open to proposals which will materially improve the public presentation of the Commonwealth's financial affairs it must be noted that the Committee's recommendations go beyond the Commonwealth's jurisdiction and deal with matters which are within the responsibilities of the State and Territory Governments. In particular, Recommendation Six envisages that the States and the Territories would be prepared to have reports on their affairs audited and tabled for review by the Commonwealth Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is necessary to appreciate that the Loan Council is not an institution that is under the control of the Commonwealth Government but is comprised of representatives of sovereign Governments who are accountable to their individual State or Territory Parliaments. By its nature, the Loan Council is a cooperative institution in which durable agreements can only be achieved on a voluntary basis when there is perceived to be a common interest. Voluntary and informal arrangements have been a significant feature, and probably the major feature, of the Loan Council's operations throughout its existence. In these circumstances, the views of the State and Territory Governments are central to the Senate Committee's proposals. It is not possible or, indeed, appropriate for the Commonwealth Government to respond to the Committee's recommendations insofar as they relate to the affairs of the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not aware that there has been any response made to the Senate Committee's report by State or Territory Ministers although I note that the Premiers and Chief Ministers of the States and Territories signed the revised Financial Agreement together with the Commonwealth at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments in Hobart on 25 February 1994 in the knowledge of the Committee's recommendations for further changes to the Agreement. The recommendations in the Committee's third report have been drawn to the attention of State and Territory officials. The responses received at official level indicated that there may not be a consensus amongst the States and Territories in favour of their implementation. In the circumstances, the Commonwealth proposes to keep under notice the recommendations of the Committee that involve the responsibilities of the States and Territories with a view to their being an input to the discussion when relevant issues are discussed in the context of the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The foregoing comments have concentrated on the major elements of the Committee's recommendations as they affect the nature and operations of the Loan Council as a cooperative Commonwealth/State body. I should also respond to other matters which the Senate Committee has raised in its report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Recommendation Four the Committee proposed that all authorities which could generate public sector debt that is subject to Loan Council review be advised of the reporting requirements with which they must comply. The Commonwealth Government fully endorses this recommendation which is already encompassed by the process for formulating the Commonwealth's LCA nomination in the lead up to the annual Loan Council meeting and the subsequent reporting of outcomes. Under this process Commonwealth departments, agencies and statutory authorities are notified of the information requirements under the new Loan Council arrangements. The States and Territories are responsible for advising their Departments and authorities of Loan Council reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Recommendation Two the Senate Committee proposed that the State and Commonwealth Governments adopt accrual accounting as a matter of priority for the purpose of reporting all government financial transactions, including Loan Council disclosures. As a practical matter, the Loan Council could only move to an accrual system when all member jurisdictions had done so on a consistent basis. The implications of accrual accounting for Loan Council matters will need to be explored as jurisdictions become familiar with its general use for government operations and in the light of the objectives of Loan Council reporting. However, the Committee's recommendation goes considerably beyond the application of accrual accounting to Loan Council reporting and it would clearly not be appropriate, in the Government's view, for Loan Council matters to drive the broader issues which bear on the implementation of accrual accounting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the broader issues, the Government announced several years ago that Commonwealth Departments and agencies were moving progressively to preparing their financial reports on an accruals basis. It is currently expected that all agencies will be able to report on an accruals basis for 1994-95. I understand that the States and Territories have also given considerable attention to the adoption of accrual accounting. The timing of their adoption of accrual accounting is a matter for the States and Territories to consider in the light of their own priorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994. This is the government's long awaited response to assist rural families in drought afflicted areas, many of whom have lived on negative or very low incomes for up to four years. The drought relief payment will provide eligible families in certified extreme drought areas with income assistance equivalent to the jobsearch allowance, partner allowance and family payment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill amends the Farm Household Support Act so that its objectives include `to provide financial assistance to farmers who are experiencing difficulty in meeting living expenses and who are in exceptional circumstances due to extreme drought'. In order to be qualified to receive the drought relief payment, a farmer must have a drought exceptional circumstances certificate issued by the state RAS authority. Importantly, farmers on farm household support may transfer to the drought relief payment, which has the advantage of not being repayable in the future. Drought relief payments are inalienable grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm related assets, farmers' life insurance and superannuation are all disregarded in calculating the value of the farmer's assets in assessing eligibility for the drought relief payment. The JSA income test will apply. A farmer does not have to put his property on the market to qualify; nor does he have to have a letter from the bank saying that he has been refused commercial finance&mdash;a Stalinist tactic tried unsuccessfully with the farm household support payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The office of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) issued a question and answer paper following the drought package announcement from which we learn that the RAS extreme drought certification will be valid for six months at a time. Payments will be for up to six months at a time&mdash;which means they can be for less than six months and all clients will be reviewed every six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not set out the length of time for which the drought relief payment is payable; nor does it provide for parliamentary scrutiny of the classification of drought declared areas. These are necessarily fluid areas as drought declarations over various regions will naturally change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it does give absolute power over the eligibility of applicants to a memorandum of understanding between the RAS authority and the Secretary to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. The success or failure of the initiatives being debated in the Senate today will hinge on this memorandum of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In itself, the objectives and content generally of this legislation are admirable, if long overdue, but its effectiveness in alleviating genuine financial hardship for farming families suffering due to matters beyond their control is entirely out of the hands of the parliament and squarely in the hands of the negotiators of this memorandum of understanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Presumably, the minister will be issuing press releases as to changes in drought declarations, but I ask the minister, as an act of faith to the rural families he is trying so hard to help, whether he will table the memorandum of understanding reached by his department with the state RAS authorities and keep the parliament informed of alterations and changed drought circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought is a national issue and a national problem. The Senate cannot do its job and review the government's performance in combating drought unless this information is brought to its attention. There are many parts to the drought problem. This bill tackles the poverty aspect of many families whose stories have been so well highlighted in the media. It is true to say that the Australian people, by their generous response, have led the government to recognise the serious nature of the drought and its effect on Australian families in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be said that the personal testimonies of people in the bush have been instrumental in attracting the attention and now action by the government. It was very hard for some of these families who were interviewed by the media to disclose private details about their financial situations. But because of the courage of a few, many thousands will benefit. Their actions have been very much a public service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is expected to lead to expenditure on the drought relief payments of $43.45 million in the current year and $19.31 million in 1995-96, with an additional $4.36 million this year in family payments and $1.93 million next year. Much of the drought package and the coalition response is already on the public record. I would like to reiterate that, as far as providing a living allowance for families stung by years of low and negative incomes is concerned, this bill will be most welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural families have not had the same access to income support as have families in the city areas with access to JSA, for example. The farm household support was essentially a  loan and was therefore most unpopular. It was extremely difficult to be eligible for the JSA, so there was virtually no way for these cash-starved families to support themselves while their stock and crops failed season after season. The mushrooming of drought funds committees and the networks of charities and organisations&mdash;including the international aid organisation Care Australia&mdash;demonstrates not only the generosity of Australians but also the large hole that needed to be filled and should have been filled by government long before this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even so, winning cabinet support for this legislation was a singular achievement for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, as he faced a cabinet used to imposing fees, charges and taxes on the rural sector rather than implementing incentives. The government's promise of tax incentives for farm storage and water facilities, and further initiatives in the areas of taxation and income equalisation deposits, will simply return to farmers some of what the Labor government has taken off them in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its first year of office alone, Labor cut general depreciation allowances, abolished farm fuel storage depreciation, scrapped automatic tax averaging provisions, increased various excise taxes, and abolished sales tax exemptions on some inputs. In 1985, farm water conservation was dealt a blow by replacing its write-off in the year of expenditure with a write-off over five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While royalty was wined and dined in 1988, assistance to isolated children was cut by 17 per cent, reducing the number of children being assisted from 19,000 to 14,500. This was followed by the termination of some equalisation arrangements  and the hard-hitting assets testing so hurtful in particular to the chances of rural children getting a secondary and tertiary education. I have not even mentioned all the other taxes and fees imposed on rural industries over the last 10 years; nor the cuts to local government and road funding; nor the government's engineered years of high interest rates that have been so devastating to rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must keep this drought package in perspective. This is not government charity or even generosity; it is merely paying an instalment on what this country owes rural Australia. So this bill is good so far as it goes. It serves to redress some of the imbalance between the income support available to urban families and the income support available to rural families. This bill does something. Queensland has issued some 3,000 claim forms to date, according to a Social Security spokesman yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group which has missed out on both income support and industry assistance is the non-farm small business community, many of whom have been carrying farmers through the long drought period and suffering great loss of custom because of restricted farm budgets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland state government has instituted a small business drought assistance scheme to help locally owned small businesses affected by the drought. Businesses may be eligible for interest subsidies of up to $5,000 a year on new or existing commercial loans for up to two years. They must demonstrate that their need for assistance is related to the impact of drought, that they would be considered viable in normal conditions and have long-term prospects of profitability. To businesses on their knees, this is not much of a lifeline. It would be far more effective if backed up by federal support which matched the state effort dollar for dollar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have learned anything from this drought, it is that long-term drought is a national problem affecting the health of a variety of communities, not just farming. A host of other economic performance indicators are affected&mdash;indicators such as employment, capital investment, savings, inflation and, most importantly, exports and trade. One cannot tackle a long-term drought by just focusing on income support payments for farmers. A holistic support approach is needed to prevent wholesale damage. And that means including structural assistance for agricultural and other small businesses in drought affected areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has allocated $25 million in its drought package to drought exceptional circumstances interest subsidies. These interest subsidies will often mean the difference between the success or failure of the farm enterprise. This is the assistance category which will make the difference between a rural sector being in good enough shape to capitalise on the rains when they come or in disrepair and years behind in making its rightful contribution to the national economic effort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the government will not look at fodder subsidies to preserve breeding stock, RAS interest subsidies provide the only avenue to keep drought regions on their feet at a farm gate level. We must not confuse assistance to keep food on the farm table and assistance to keep the farm table on the farm. They are quite separate and go to two different parts of the drought problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twenty-five million dollars for drought exceptional circumstances is not a committed response from this government. Nor did the government use the drought package as an opportunity to ease the eligibility criteria for RAS interest subsidies, as called for by the opposition, the NFF and other industry groups. Unless farmers can access RAS, it will not really matter how much is in the kitty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a repeat of the shameful failure of the wool rescue package if RAS eligibility criteria were not changed to reflect the fact that it is survival stakes out there&mdash;and those in a position to consider productivity improvements are in a luxurious position compared with farmers facing their fifth year of drought. The minister has given a commitment to review the eligibility criteria, but what every farmer wants to know is when will it happen. I personally asked the minister a question about that last week and he said that he was doing it now. I would like to know when is `now'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned the wool rescue package because it is a salient example of how a well-meaning package can go terribly wrong if there is a hitch in delivery due to overly restrictive eligibility criteria. Aimed at 5,790 growers, the wool package was received by only 1,960. Only $15 million out of the allocated $42.2 million for wool exceptional circumstances got to the farm gate. Farmers could not meet the conditions&mdash;not because they were too well off&mdash;and that meant that far too many efficient growers were left with nothing to get them through. The performance to date of RAS drought exceptional circumstances does not lead to optimism about the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From January 1993 to the end of March 1994 only 3,301 approvals were given&mdash;in the middle of a devastating drought. Yet we are told there are 12,000 to 15,000 farming families in dire straits due to this drought. The criteria are too restrictive. Removing some off-farm assets and raising the RAS cap does very little to get RAS to the many farmers with no off-farm assets and unable to get RAS so far. Unless the situation is addressed, the drought package will not go very far towards keeping devastated rural Australians going as a sustainable economic unit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak to the Drought Relief Payment Bill, which will introduce a drought relief payment for some of Australia's hardest-hit farm families. Let me say at the outset that the Australian Democrats certainly welcome this drought relief package announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 21 September. I congratulate Senator Collins for getting these measures through the cabinet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats will be supporting this bill. We are keen to see it passed by the Senate as quickly as possible to ensure that there is no delay in making these drought relief payments available. To that end, we have exercised some restraint in the number of speakers that we will have on the bill. Perhaps the only regrettable part of the government's drought package is that it took so long for it to be brought to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This drought, which for many parts of the eastern half of the continent has been the worst on record, has been going on for four long years. Action from the government to alleviate the suffering being inflicted on farm families is well and truly overdue. Unfortunately for some of our farming families, that action will have come too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the drought looking as though it may stretch out until autumn next year, the pressure on Australia's family farmers is greater than it ever has been. It is inevitable that by the time the rains finally come&mdash;and we all hope that is sooner rather than later&mdash;a large number of farming families will have been forced to leave the land and forced to leave farming operations which may have been in the same family for four or five generations. These properties will be bought up at rock-bottom prices, and the expertise and character that farm families have provided to the Australian bush for so many years will be lost forever, as will their contribution to the social and economic framework of regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent weeks I have had numerous phone calls from farmers who have seen a letter to the editor or an article in their local papers mentioning the Democrats and have rung up to offer their support and&mdash;even more, I suspect&mdash;to have a sympathetic ear at the other end of the line to talk through some of the difficulties they are currently facing. Drought is obviously the most striking of these, but high interest rates, low commodity prices and the gradual decline of country towns and services are still inflicting a heavy burden on farm families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the older families, who have lived through drought before but say that this time it has gone on so long that they need outside help, have been calling up. One man who has now retired on his farm in central Queensland said to one of my staff that some of his 10 children and 28 grandchildren are farmers. While he is very worried about them and has much to offer, he is scared to help them out in any way for fear of losing his pension. He said that when one of his children recently visited him for a few weeks and lived in their caravan in the backyard he lost his rates concessions, supposedly because there was `someone else' living on his property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Others are younger families who have done as much as they could to prepare for the droughts that inevitably occur in this country but have found that their preparations were not enough for this latest extended drought. Ironically, it is some of these farmers who have made preparations that have found the financial preparations they have made for drought are the very factors that to date have precluded them from any government assistance. A number have complained that the only way they can get any assistance from the government is through interest rate subsidies under RAS, which means they would have to rack up more and more debt in order to get the subsidy&mdash;a crazy, circular, unending trail of debt and more debt. The effects of rural debt then are just as crippling as drought for these particular families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the voice of another farmer who phoned one could tell there was a real mixture of anger, frustration and desperation. He said he was sick and tired of having to go out and look at his animals slowly starving to death. He said he spends hours on the phone trying to hunt down feed but, by the time he finds some, it has already been sold to somebody else. He said that what farmers are really looking for is results on the ground, not television pictures of politicians putting bandaid measures in place and proclaiming themselves the farmers' saviours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us look at what the government is doing for farmers. Today we are considering the drought relief payment, and again I say that the Democrats welcome the introduction of this new payment. The drought relief payment will be available to those families whose incomes have been affected by extreme drought for 24 of the past 36 months. It will be subject to an income and off-farm assets test and will be paid at a rate equivalent to the jobsearch allowance. Partner allowance and family allowance will also be paid where these are appropriate. Importantly, these payments will be made without any activity testing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Claims for the drought relief payment will be handled by the Department of Social Security, and farmers will need to provide a certificate from their rural adjustment scheme authority verifying that they are in exceptional drought circumstances. Recipients of the payment will also be eligible for a health care card, and their children will qualify for Austudy. I applaud all of those measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farm assets, life insurance and superannuation will not be included in the assets test for the drought relief payment. I noted that a number of journalists described the exemption of farm assets as a major policy shift by the ALP, and the Prime Minister himself described it as a revolutionary change in policy. I am not so sure about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some cases, farm assets are already exempted from the assets test&mdash;such as under the farm household support scheme&mdash;just as they are for some payments made under the assistance for isolated children's scheme. Perhaps it is not so much a revolutionary change on the part of the Labor Party, but a limited and begrudging acceptance of the fact that the assets test harshly discriminates against all farmers and has done so for many years. It seems to me that the Labor Party has assessed that the electoral cost to it of maintaining the inequity is minimal, except in this particular case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the intense media attention in this case&mdash;the media has done a service; let us compliment them, because sometimes we are very critical of them&mdash;has been instrumental in bringing the real plight of farmers to all Australians. Because of the attention that has been focused on the assets test and its affect on drought-stricken farmers, the government has made this concession. Of course, the government was fully aware that, without this concession, no farm family would have qualified for the new payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If either the government or the opposition had listened to what we said for years when we tried to ease the assets test for farmers, some of the suffering that farm families have had to endure throughout this drought might already have been alleviated. Thousands of farmers throughout the country have had negative incomes for a number of years due to low commodity prices, high interest rates and other factors, including fire, flood and mouse plagues. Despite those negative incomes, those farmers have been unable to access the most basic social security or student assistance payment. Many of those farmers will still not gain anything from this package. I believe farmers need to be given the same assistance that all other Australians have available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must recognise that family farms are not tradable assets. They are assets which, together with an accumulated wealth of farming knowledge, are handed down from generation to generation. This intergenerational transfer is an essential part of the Australian farming industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are pleased to see farm assets exempted from the assets test on the drought relief payment. We urge the government and opposition to consider extending this principle to all other social security and student assistance payments. Overall, the Democrats welcome the introduction of the drought relief payment, just as we welcome the additional funding that is to be provided for RAS and rural counselling services. The drought package addresses the most desperate, short-term issues being faced by Australian farm families. It is not, however, a cure-all for our primary producers, and I hope it does not mean that people will lose interest in the plight of farm families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of rural debt, in particular, requires far more attention. As I have said on previous occasions, there is an urgent need for representatives from the various governments, banks, rural counsellors and farming organisations to work together to identify solutions to the debt crisis. I support Senator Boswell and Senator McGauran for their comments and questions today about the Prime Minister's promise to talk to the banks. This is an absolutely urgent task, and I trust that he will fulfil that promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the farmers who have lasted this long and are still on the land, it will take many years to return to a position of profitability&mdash;when herds can be re-stocked, run-down machinery can at last be replaced, more time and resources can be devoted to landcare issues and they can once again afford to send their children to college. Australia needs to stand by its farmers now and will need to do so for many years to come. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to speak on the Drought Relief Payment Bill and to acknowledge that, at last, the government has brought matters to a head and brought this bill before the Senate to help the struggling farmers affected by the drought. I do not need to tell honourable senators how bad the situation is. This issue has been debated in the parliament quite extensively in the past four or five weeks, so there is no need to dwell on its severity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the drought in the eastern states is the worst drought&mdash;by any stretch of our imagination&mdash;since 1982. In Western Australia, we have not had a bad drought since 1983. I have had the experience of going through a drought. I am not talking as someone who watches from a distance. In Western Australia, I went through the bad droughts of 1969, 1976 and 1977&mdash;two years in a row&mdash;and, of course, 1983. Even though Western Australia has had a reasonably good season, I feel for the farmers who are in that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased that the government has attempted to help farmers by way of social security measures rather than any other way. I believe that is the fairest and most basic way to help people. I believe it is a person's basic right to at least have food on the table, whether living in a country town or the city. Even a bankrupt person who might have been bankrupted by his own stupidity should have food on the table. It is the same for someone who loses a job&mdash;and jobs have been lost by stupidity. A person who loses a job through stupidity still has the basic right to have food on the table. The responsibility to provide basic needs for farmers&mdash;no matter where they may live&mdash;probably falls on the rest of the people of Australia who are doing better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the government's change in policy on Austudy. Outside a farmer's own plight on the farm, if he or she has children going through the education system who are not receiving Austudy, one of the worst things that can happen&mdash;on top of the drought&mdash;is if his or her children have to break their education. I have quoted figures in this place on the drop-out rate for children receiving an education&mdash;when they take 12 months off or have a break during their course. Those figures are fairly high, although I do not know what they are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the government for taking away the assets test on farmers affected by the drought and for allowing farmers to meet the other criteria for 24 out of the previous 36 months. I believe that that is one of the most important measures, alongside having basic commodities. I also commend the government for putting in the flexibility for farmers if they have been affected by drought for 24 out of the past 36 months. If there is a drought followed by a reasonable season and then a drought, farmers can hardly say that they are out of trouble, so I welcome that flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know it is very tough when farmers fall over one side of the line and qualify for assistance and then fall over the other side of the line. The government has to look at extreme cases like that. In the 1980s, with the devastating 1983 drought, the Western Australian government looked at its system. It used to declare droughts by shires and split shires. The bigger shires acted further on the recommendation of the local shires saying that a drought could be declared in a pocket within a shire without that area even including half the shire. I believe that system worked very well, and I think we could look at that situation in extreme, isolated cases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only lack of rain that at times creates drought. I know that Peter Walsh laughed when he was asked for drought aid because it had rained too much. It may seem stupid on the face of it, but those sorts of things, including frosts, can wipe people out. Of course, one can be insured for thunderstorms and hail, but not for a lot of the other things that I have mentioned. So I believe the government should look at people who are in extreme circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, Western Australia has had a reasonable sort of season, but there are pockets of Western Australia that are badly affected by the present season, including the south-east of Western Australia in the Esperance area. Maybe they do not qualify as having been in extreme drought for 24 months out of the last 36, but something has to be looked at. There would not be very many people in that situation&mdash;one could probably count them on one hand&mdash;but their position has to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most badly affected area in Western Australia is the pastoral areas of the East Gascoyne region, which is sheep grazing country. They may just qualify as having been in drought for 24 months out of the last 36 months. If they do not qualify strictly because of a month, I believe their situation also has to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also commend the government's move to pay social security rather than the farm supplement six months after a drought is declared finished. I welcome that. Because there is a big rain one day, people do not have an income the next. I remember the eastern states drought of 1982 breaking in March 1983. In fact, it broke very soon after Ron Barassi gave a pep talk at a bull sale in northern New South Wales. He said, `Have confidence and buy some of these bulls. The rains will come.' The rains did come within a few days, and Ron Barassi has claimed that fame forever and a day. The rains did come the next day, but it would have taken at least six months, and more in the case of a wheat crop&mdash;if there were a drought in March, it would certainly be November or December before it was over&mdash;before people's incomes started again. I commend the government for building in that flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look to the future. I have said in this place before that the end of the drought will come one day. I am a super-optimist anyway. What the government has to do, whoever is in government at the time, is provide incentives for people affected in this way to provide for themselves. I am afraid that that has not been done probably for the last seven or eight years. Of course, for the last seven or eight years this government has been in power. I will not go into detail now, but we have to look at better IEDs and better incentives, without going overboard, to conserve fodder, water and cash reserves. The cash reserves come from those IEDs. That has to be looked at in the years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think this package does anything at all for the plight of small business, except that it gets some money flowing in the country. So at least some farmers indebted to small business can pay them something along the lines of what they owe. Though there is nothing in this package, I think something has to be done in the future for small business, which goes through these ups and downs that farmers go through in severe downturn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the most important people are the children of those small business people. People in small business have assets, but they are blocked out by the assets test. But some of them have children long distances away at university. I can tell honourable senators from experience how much it costs to educate children from the country. They should be given Austudy to help them get through their courses so that in better times those younger people can provide for themselves. If they drop out and are not able to finish their courses, they will have to be helped by this sort of system again in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have used my allocated time, so I conclude by saying that I welcome these measures. There has been a big turnaround since the Prime Minister's first visit to Queensland when he said that anyone fool enough to live in that area should cop it. I am glad that the government has come around. Let us see what we can give these farmers to keep them in their places for another day. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go over the technical points of this bill, which have been so well covered by opposition speakers, because we are very short of time. We are on a limited speaking time of about six to eight minutes each. What I want to do, though, is emphasise two points that illustrate the shortcomings of this government and the neglect it has shown of Australian rural industries. Those two points are quite simple: first, the delay in recognising that we had a drought of enormous magnitude upon a large part of Queensland and New South Wales; and, secondly, when at last the government responded and reacted to that drought, the administrative systems that it put in place were either inefficient or non-existent. It is only now, three weeks after the announcement was made, that there might be something in place to deliver the measures that were promised by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is just par for the course for this government. There is a total neglect of, not to say contempt for, the rural industries of Australia. In the 12 years that the Labor Party has been in government we have seen a positive attack on the rural producers of this country, to remove from them the resources they need to pursue a profitable course which is of benefit not only to themselves but also the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been things like the removal of the effective income equalisation deposit scheme that was in existence under the previous Liberal government; huge increases in fuel excise, which impacts very greatly on rural producers; and the imposition of the fringe benefits tax, the significance of which on Australian rural industry has never been appreciated in this parliament. They are just three things that have made life very difficult. They have diminished the profitability of rural producers in Australia and, in so doing, have limited their ability to provide for themselves. We do not want to be given handout schemes in any way at all; we just want recognition for the particular difficulties we face and facilitation to provide for ourselves so that we are not a call on the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned in the discussion on the matter of public importance in the last sitting week, depreciation rates are a good example. If we build a shed or put a dam in we get seven per cent depreciation allowed per year. Yet if one buys a personal computer and is a small businessman in the urban areas, there is a depreciation rate of 27 per cent. It can be written off in about three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why can we not have a little bit of parity, particularly as rural industries are so important to Australia? Even in these difficult times they provide something like 25 per cent of Australia's export earnings. We cannot all live on welfare; we do need to earn money. Only last week we had the announcement that in the last quarter this country had spent a massive amount in excess of $2,000 million more than it had earned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of today's papers contained a small article based on some projections by Access Economics, a very reputable economics forecasting firm in Canberra. It forecast that the way things are going, unless the government takes some measures to control the drift, the balance of payments deficit will be $25 billion&mdash;that is, $25,000 million&mdash;by the end of next year. We will have spent $25,000 million more that we earned. That has to be paid for by our exports. So, by any standards, there is a need to cosset and to look after our rural industries. All that we have seen is a contraction of those industries under Labor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the situation be explained in any other terms than total neglect or indifference? Although we are experiencing a huge drought, the biggest drought in our history, despite all the comments in both chambers from members of the Liberal Party and the National Party, it was not until a month ago that the government recognised that we had a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the Prime Minister went to my own state of Queensland and said, in effect, that drought was a natural part of life, and that we should stop whingeing about our lot. There was such an outrage over that that he was forced to come back a few weeks later. As a result of that we have this bill before us today, which we all welcome. I wish the legislation a speedy passage through the Senate. But it really is quite inexcusable that it took 3 1/2 years to recognise the magnitude of the drought and the fact that it is a problem of national significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing happened after the announcement was made by the Prime Minister. There has been a total blanket on the dissemination of knowledge. The government, as a matter of priority, should have ensured, through the Public Service, that the terms and conditions relating to application for grants were spelled out clearly, that the grants available were spelled out clearly and that the Department of Social Security officers in rural areas and officers responsible for the rural adjustment scheme were fully advised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I listened very carefully to what the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, said in this chamber during question time earlier this week. I hope he is right, but if he is right, it has all happened this week. I can tell the Senate that up until Monday, when I came to Canberra, my office in Brisbane had received a number of calls. I was told by the rural adjustment scheme office in Brisbane that it had had more than 800 calls a day about this scheme and that staff simply could not cope. I was told that when the staff phoned around the country areas, Department of Social Security officers said they were being besieged by inquiries from farmers and applicants for assistance but that they did not have the information to provide to them. Further inquiries made by my office to head office in Canberra revealed a state of confusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is bad government that that happens. The expectations of people who have been suffering a great deal were raised. We tend to think of droughts in purely financial terms, but the emotional consequences and the distress on families and people involved, not only in the rural industries&mdash;on the farms and properties themselves&mdash;but in the country towns, the small businesses, is really quite acute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that point, one of the measures undertaken in relation to the drought has been the distribution of food packages. That is a very noble act of charity by members of the community. But the actual distribution of food rather than sending money means that the shopkeepers in the country towns do not get the return on the sale of that food to people in the area, so their lot becomes that much more difficult again. Yesterday during question time, the Minister complimented members of the Department of Social Security. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those officers have performed minor miracles in getting this money on the ground as quickly as they are.</PARA>
<PARA>Later on, in the same answer to the question, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Something in excess of 3,000 applications, on my latest advice, have been processed just in the last 48 hours. That was the purpose of that exercise.</PARA>
<PARA>If they were processed, that is well and good. But the impression that I have formed, having followed this up in the most affected of the drought states, the state of Queensland, is that up till the end of last week really nothing effective had been achieved. I think that is quite inexcusable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, something is moving and I hope that relief is at hand for those people who apply for it under this bill. But we are a long way short of resolving the problem. We are always faced with droughts in Australia. When we get a drought of the magnitude of four or five years, such as the one we are facing now, is very difficult to cope in terms of water storage, fodder storage and so on. It does have a major effect. But we can look at ways of ameliorating the effects of droughts by encouraging rural producers to make provision for them, and I think this government has a long way to go in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, this is really very little and very late. When I say it is very little, I note that this year $52.99 million extra is being spent and that $24.22 million will be spent next year. By way of comparison, I point out that over $150 million was spent on redundancy payments on the waterfront plus a lot of other money as well&mdash;in the aggregate it was far higher than that&mdash;and the nation got very little or no benefit from it. This is really the minimal response the government can make and it is very late. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this afternoon to make my contribution to the government's drought package in response to the disastrous drought that has been going on for four years. My property is in an area that is under exceptional circumstances&mdash;in fact, it has been in drought for 27 of the last 36 months. Just to put that in perspective, our average rainfall is 28 inches a year, and this year we have had 9 inches. So it really is a disastrous drought for us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am probably the only senator who will spend, subject to my Senate duties, every weekend for the foreseeable future on the back of a feed bin, which is immensely depressing and an immensely expensive way to spend time. But that is obviously part and parcel of farming, and I guess that all farmers appreciate the difficulties that they face and can see the value of it in the end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This response by the government is belated, but it is a case of better late than never. I think it is fair to say that the coalition can take a large amount of the credit for getting drought on to the national agenda. I commend my colleague and leader, Senator Boswell, for his role in the media in that regard and also the shadow minister, John Anderson, for his contribution to the debate with the package he brought down on behalf of the coalition two weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, that package dealt with the three prongs of immediate relief. The first area related to welfare. The government's response of the drought family payment and the removal of the assets test from Austudy certainly goes a very large way to meeting the principles enunciated under immediate relief. The second area that John Anderson talked about was the retention of the breeding herd, and that is something that remains largely unattended by this package. The third aspect that he talked about was reconstruction. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has said that later on, perhaps in November, the government will bring down a broader approach to taxation in dealing with severe drought in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two months ago, the Prime Minister was in Queensland. He said, `Droughts are natural.' Droughts are natural, but severe droughts are not. Some weeks ago, the government was moved to act because of the widespread publicity and the charity concert held by media celebrities. I noticed that Senator Collins just yesterday, in answer to a question from me, said, `Those areas that are not in exceptional circumstances can look to getting some help from the farmhand appeal.' I am very thankful that the farmhand appeal has been operating; I believe that it has brought city and country closer together. But to think of charity being the only thing available to farmers who do not qualify under exceptional circumstances is extreme naivety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that, in terms of the amount of money available, the federal government originally allocated $10 million for Farmhand on a one-to-one basis. Senator Collins said yesterday that 3,800 farm families had received $9 million. That is about half of what is available. The drought will go on for an awful lot longer than the money available under farmhand will last. The reason the Prime Minister acted was that he could see that the drought was electorally damaging. He sort of discovered the drought. The media fell upon his visit in a frenzy. The day after the package was announced, I read an article by Asa Wahlquist in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> which I think really puts in perspective how the media fell onto the package and said how good it was. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A century of antagonism and suspicion was yesterday allayed when the Prime Minister championed the needs of farming families.</PARA>
<PARA>I think she has gone a little overboard there, especially when we consider that the previous response from the government had been so pitiful&mdash;$14 million in extra RAS funding&mdash;and especially compared with the Prime Minister's instant response of $150 million for the Cahill Expressway, and the multimillions of dollars that were pushed in the way of the waterside workers to get them back to work recently and to get ANL to be a saleable proposition. But I do not wish to proceed further with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to make a couple of brief points about the ongoing problems. The first concerns the feed grain situation. It was reported earlier this week that there was a three-week supply of feed grain available in the eastern states. The minister said that he has ABARE working to complete a national grain audit. I am pleased that the minister has said that, despite the pessimistic forecasts, the government expects that in aggregate there will be enough grain to meet domestic food and feed requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will have to be movements of grain around Australia and the importation of feed grain and specialist grain, such as high quality durum wheat, that is required for pasta production. Even if the minister is correct and there will be enough feed grain available, there is a feed crisis, as there is a cash crisis to pay for the feed. The intensive livestock industry is particularly affected. Piggeries are closing. Poultry industries, especially those in areas situated away from the coast and unable to access imported grain because of the necessary AQIS protocols, and the feedlot and grazing industries are all affected by the unavailability of grain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know the minister has approved the importation 120,000 tonnes of sorghum and 10,000 tonnes of maize. That is to be applauded. We, as a nation, are not set up to import large amounts of grain&mdash;we just do not have those sorts of ports&mdash;so it is a whole new crisis for us to face. Just to put it in perspective, New South Wales normally has a winter cereal crop of about 5 1/2 million tonnes&mdash;and half a million tonnes are expected this season. In Queensland, the normal crop is about 3 1/2 million tonnes. Again, there may be half a million tonnes produced. New South Wales normally produces about 500,000 tonnes of sorghum, half of it on the Liverpool Plains, an area from which I come. The shortfall for feed grain in New South Wales will be three million tonnes; and if the sorghum crop fails, it will be five million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price of feed grain has nearly doubled in the last two months. Wheat has gone from $160 a tonne to $230 a tonne and maize has gone from around $180 a tonne to $300 a tonne. Hay and baled sorghum stubble are virtually unprocurable. The inflationary and trade impacts of this crisis are very hard to quantify. Food prices are already going up. The prices of wheat, cereals, fruit and vegetables are already going up. The CPI will certainly be affected by this drought. The price of chicken, pork and eggs is going up. It will damage the worst balance of payments figure but one, that being in January 1990. The August balance of payments current account deficit was $2.1 billion, which will require higher government borrowings&mdash;and can only flow on to higher inflation,. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE suggests that rural exports will decline by nearly six per cent in 1994-95. That will amount to around a $3 billion loss for farmers. The blow-out in the current account will certainly have an effect on interest rates. It must be remembered that, for every one per cent rise in interest rates, debt repayments for farmers will increase by about $150 million a year. It is worth saying that, if the government will not cut its spending, everybody in the country must cut their spending, because the fact of interest rates going up means that farmers, mortgagors and everyone else who owes money will have more money to pay back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has indicated that he is having a feed audit. I suggest to him that he consider a feed summit because they are part and parcel of the same thing. New South Wales farmers are calling for a summit; the coalition is calling in addition for a fodder subsidy. That would certainly be part and parcel of a discussion on the feed audit. I ask the government to look again at the possibility of a fodder subsidy. The minister indicated that in 1982-83 it was rorted. He has given no evidence of former convictions. He also said it caused a blow-out in the price of grain. I can tell senators that the price of grain has gone up very substantially this time, without any sort of a feed subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a point about the inclusion last week of the six areas initially said to be in exceptional circumstances in New South Wales. Over the last 36 months, these areas have been in drought for a considerable time: Dubbo, 16 months; Grafton, 17 months; Merriwa, 23 months; Mudgee, 19 months; Nyngan 19 months; and Scone, 17 months. Mr Harry Woods, who heads the rural task force for the government, naively suggested that the farmers in these areas who did not at this stage qualify under exceptional circumstances should rely on charity from farmhand. Whilst I applaud farmhand and all that it has done, it is a very sad day for Australia when our farmers are reduced to receiving handouts from the Salvos or the Smith Family. I do however applaud the city for identifying with this country problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must plan for the future. Farmers must have the ability to plan. There must be recognition that severe drought is a natural disaster. There must be a recognition of the hurt that small businesses are feeling in this drought and a return to the natural disaster relief arrangements for severe drought so they can access help as well. I applaud the New South Wales government on it decision yesterday to contribute $20 million particularly to assist them, and also the Queensland government, which has done the same thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a recognition of the incredible debt burden that farmers are facing. It is not just a problem for farmers; it is a problem for the banks and the government. As was pointed out today in question time, the Prime Minister has not yet met the banks, as he promised when he announced his package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like Senator Panizza, I am an optimist. People on the land have to be. So I would like to finish on a slightly optimistic note and say that it looks as though when this drought breaks, as it surely will, prices for grain, wool and beef will be strong for a couple of years. But high prices are good for farmers only if they have something to sell. Prices can go up 300 per cent, but that will not benefit farm families in the broad because they have been so weakened by this drought. At the end of the day, I have to agree with an editorial in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Land</EMPHASIS> of 1 September, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless this country wakes up to itself, the end of this drought&mdash;when it comes&mdash;will trigger the biggest exodus from the land Australia has seen. And it won't be because of the drought.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am conscious that the Senate wishes to expedite the passage of this Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994 so that the little bit of benefit to be gained from it will get out to the people who need it very badly. Therefore, I will not go through the many concerns that I have about our reaction to the drought, not the least of which is the absence of any plan to protect the nucleus of Australian stock and the absence of any scheme to provide affordable feed for farmers to feed the stock they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to keep in mind the parlous economic state of the agricultural sector prior to the drought which was the direct result of anti-rural government policies. I think most of them can be attributed to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he was Treasurer or since he has been the Prime Minister. Those policies include increased primary industry charges, fuel excise increases, wholesale sales tax increases, investment allowance removals and the removal just recently of the exceptional circumstances provisions for wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government reneged on its election promise to remove the assets test for farm families to receive Austudy. It imposed and extended the fringe benefits tax and the capital gains tax and basically imposed de facto death duties on rural communities. The government also gutted the IED scheme, removed the wool floor price scheme and gave us high interest rates that especially hurt the farmers. The result of that was that farm borrowings moved from about $5 billion up to $17-odd billion, and today's farm indebtedness is now $17.3 billion. I think it went from $5 billion to $16 billion in the five years prior to 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from all that, about 8.5 per cent of farmers have left their properties in the past 10 years. The Prime Minister, even though of late he has taken a little interest in the farming communities, kicked them in the teeth prior to that. Along with all the things I have mentioned, the farming community had adverse terms of trade throughout the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I applaud the New South Wales government for the additional $20 million drought package that it came out with in the last 24 hours.

We take all those kinds of factors into account before determining that an area falls into exceptional circumstances and determining the initial set of protection board districts that would be covered those factors were taken into account by the 2 Governments, decisions were made as to which assistance would initially apply, and then there's a general trip wire, if you like, for additions to that area, and that's the 24 out of 36 rule."</PARA>

If a cruel hoax has been played on the farmers in those districts, the blame must lie with the federal department which gave such advice on a state wide link. In relation to the parlous state of these areas which have now been taken off the list, I would like to quote part of a letter I have from Andrew Badgery, a rural counsellor in the Upper Hunter Rural Counselling Service.

To slightly relax the guidelines for the drought package would give them some hope so they can at least feed their family!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NB: I AM NOT TALKING ABOUT THE VIABILITY OF FARMERS, I AM TALKING ABOUT IMMEDIATE SURVIVAL.</PARA>
<PARA>That is how tough and crook things are out in the bush at the moment. Drought is not a time for politics. It is a time for all levels of government and all sides of politics to work together through a national tragedy. The drought has affected efficient and inefficient farmers alike and, because of the immense contribution the rural sector makes to Australia's export income, it is in the national interest to provide assistance to all who need it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am conscious&mdash;I have discussed this with the minister and others&mdash;of the enormous financial consideration that governments face in dealing with the problem. It is true that no amount of money will alleviate the pain and the suffering, but we must do all we can and</PARA>
<PARA>we must have more flexibility. Arbitrary lines drawn by bureaucrats at the tax office are not the appropriate response to this human tragedy. I urge the minister to take the decision making processes back to the coalface&mdash;to the rural lands protection boards, the shire councils. They know who needs help now and which areas can hang on a little longer. We should allow them to advise the federal agencies directly, then we will really know what is happening out there. It should not be done by somebody sitting Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucrats in Canberra do not have the relevant knowledge, and they should not be trying to make the assessments from a map. Exceptional circumstances cannot be determined by just a map. Any assessments must take into consideration the differences within shires as a result of floods, fires, rain shadows or any other circumstances that only those on the ground who know the region can determine. A person from the south of the state and who had suffered a big bushfire a year or so ago rang me the other day. Although he received some aid and some help for that, the problem is that, even with the little rain he has had, it takes years for the country to come back again after a bushfire has gone through it.

People who want to donate things have asked me how they can get them to the affected people. Again, more flexibility would be a great help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate of the economic circumstances caused by failed Labor government policies.

We have not had the appropriate packages of incentives to date.

That shows the tragic way in which this government organises its priorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Madam Acting Deputy President, I suppose you know the joke that is going around the bush. It is, regrettably, a wry sort of joke. It goes like this: what is the difference between the drought and the Cahill Expressway? The answer is: Mr Keating cannot see the drought from Kirribilli House. It is all too tragically true. This package that is before us is welcome. It is good to see that something is being done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will await what the government proposes to do to try to drought-proof Australia&mdash;the long-term rebuilding and infrastructure. I hope that Mr Keating will again follow the lead set by the opposition, as he has done in this drought package, by looking at some major infrastructure projects for the future that might lessen the effect of drought in the future. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will recall that the Leader of the Opposition, Alexander Downer, in his major directional statement <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things That Matter</EMPHASIS> did indicate that the coalition would be setting aside a portion of the proceeds of the privatisation of government assets to reinvest in major infrastructure projects. The sorts of things we will be looking at in major infrastructure projects are roads and railways. Many of these will be in rural areas, in regional Australia, and will help to alleviate some of the huge unemployment difficulties that are there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other things that we will be looking at in that context will be things such as water storage and dams. I hope someone on the other side can tell me that I am wrong, but I cannot remember a dam that has been built under the term of this government. I remember the Burdekin Dam in my area, started by Malcolm Fraser. We remember the Fairbairn Dam, the Ord River&mdash;a series of other dams back in those days when it seemed to be a proper thing to have infrastructure and dams. It seems to be politically incorrect now to have dams and infrastructure in inland Australia. I do not know why this government does not give some thought to getting involved in major dam work again. Since the Liberal government went out of power we really have not seen the construction of any dams. That is one of the things that the coalition will be looking at in the linking Australia infrastructure plan that Alexander Downer has announced in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things That Matter</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also indicated that we will be reintroducing the black spots program. That was one of the very few good things that the Labor government did. It promised it in 1990&mdash;again, following a commitment we had made. It was dragged kicking and screaming into implementing a black spots program, but to give credit where it is due, it did it. But it only lasted for three years and then it cut it out. It was one of the better programs it has implemented and it cut it out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have committed ourselves in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things That Matter</EMPHASIS> document to reintroduce the black spots program. I hope that by mentioning that we will reintroduce the black spots program, by mentioning that we will reinvest part of the proceeds of privatisation in national infrastructure, we will embarrass the Labor Party into doing something similar even before we get into government after the next election, because those sorts of things are needed in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to say how glad I am that something has been done for farmers, but I want to raise the plight of small businessmen in drought affected areas. I have been mentioning this for a couple of months now, but the government just does not seem to have heard. I am very pleased that the shadow cabinet is looking at it. I pay tribute to the shadow minister for small business, Mrs Judy Moylan, who has been very active in raising this matter in coalition areas. She has made a very good point that I support, and have supported for a number of months now.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers have had real difficulties, and fortunately they are getting some assistance now, but small business has been completely ignored by this government. I have raised this matter a number of times in press releases and otherwise, and I have given examples of where small business people in drought affected communities have been forced out of business. The executive director of the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association, Mr Ian Baldock, has supported the things that I have been saying. He has given an example of what has happened in the Toowoomba area. That is an area that has been badly affected by drought, and five businesses have been forced to close due to the drought conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Mr Baldock says, many of his shopkeeper members have debts on their books of up to $150,000, principally from farmers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted and proud to be associated with the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994 because what this package does is recognise very clearly and very carefully that there are droughts and there are droughts. There are droughts which it is impossible for the average, normal, good farmer to anticipate and prepare for. This package is going to provide a safety net for those people who have experienced four years of drought in some areas. Farmers on the Darling Downs have lost eight crops and have had no income for four years. It costs between $50,000 and $60,000 just to put in a crop. Those farmers may as well have stood there and burnt eight cheques for $50,000 or $60,000. Half a million dollars has been lost by farmers in trying to get a crop, but the rain has not come at the right time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package is designed to help those people to live through the rest of the time that this drought is with us. It is designed not to stop on the day when the rains come; there is a period of six months before it will be reviewed. This is a very good part of the bill because it recognises very clearly that, when the rain comes, the cashflow does not start. Those who have wool will have to wait until the normal shearing time, which could be six to 12 months away. Those who have crops have to wait until the crop has been sown and harvested. It will give farmers a buffer of extra time after the drought has finished and allow them to continue with an income and not be faced with the situation where they are totally bereft of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This package is estimated to cost $164 million over two years. Anyone who says that that is not a significant amount of money does not live in the real world. Senator Ian Macdonald was speaking today about the plight of small business. This package will help the small businessman as well because it will guarantee the farmers an income with which they can buy commodities from the shops in the towns. It will provide at least some of those shops and businesses in the community with income as that money is spent on food and essentials that the farmers have to buy. Those opposite keep forgetting that point. They seem to forget that the farmers will actually spend that money and that the recipients of that money will be those small businesses which are very dependent upon those farmers buying goods and commodities in their towns. So it will have an effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite also say that we should spend more money now, but it is those same opposition members who talk about fiscal responsibility and cutting the deficit. What programs would they cut? Obviously they do not want to cut any of the social security programs&mdash;or do they?&mdash;any one except this one. I am not quite sure how they plan to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this package provides a systematic approach to drought relief based on the principles of the national drought policy&mdash;a policy that recognises that drought is a recurring feature of rural Australia which needs to be factored into the normal farm business management, but which acknowledges that government assistance is necessary for people in exceptional circumstances where droughts go on longer than the norm or what they can reasonably be expected to provide for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package also includes a commitment to match dollar for dollar the farmhand appeal. Yesterday during question time we heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) say that a $5.6 million cheque from the federal government had been handed over to the farmhand appeal. He also outlined how he envisages the layer below those who have been droughted for 24 of the last 36 months could be assisted by farmhand as well, so that those who are heading towards that severe area of drought would also be given extra assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that additional measures yet to be announced are being considered in relation to areas of taxation, income equalisation, landcare and climate research and these sorts of things. These are the things that will benefit the farmers after the drought is over, and this is being worked on. This package has been put together with the close cooperation and consultation of the farmer organisations, and that is very important to remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been snide, mucky comments made by some honourable senators opposite about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) discovering the situation only of late and not caring. Obviously that is a load of rubbish. He has had his ministers looking at this issue. I know that Senator Collins was trying to get the New South Wales minister responsible to provide information about the situation in New South Wales as far back as August or so. That New South Wales minister just dillydallied around and did not come up with very much assistance for our federal minister; but we will leave that aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this is a very important package. It ill-behoves people to stand here and say, `You should do this, you should do that and you should do something else.' Those opposite need to look at what their recently outlined policy would do. It was formed without any cooperation or consultation with the industries. I believe there are two versions of the policy enunciated by Minister Anderson in both of which, New South Wales, which I represent, would have been significantly worse off. In the first formulation, that of two consecutive years of drought, only one New South Wales rural lands protection board would have qualified. Under the second proposal, that of three years of drought in five, six districts would have qualified. That is the proposal of those opposite who are saying that we are not doing enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are something like 15 lands protection boards included in our proposal, but ours is not enough; theirs obviously must be better. In my state, depending on which criteria we want to look at, either one board or six boards would be eligible; but our proposal is not good enough. Their  proposal would provide less assistance than ours; but that is not the way they choose to look at it. They just want to continue with their opposition mentality of saying, `Oh, dear. This is not very good. Mine's better than yours. You can't do that. This is what is wrong with it.' This is the sort of thing that we have to put up with all the time from this opposition. It is opposition for the sake of opposition, and that does nothing for the farmers or for this country. Our approach has been to say that those people who have been affected by drought for 24 out of 36 drought declared months will attract support from this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties which both sides acknowledge contributes to the difficulty of establishing an equitable policy response to the phenomena of severe drought is the lack of agreed definition of what constitutes drought.

They were talking about how their area is currently not drought declared, yet it is on the New South Wales border. Below them in New South Wales is drought declared, above them is not.

Queensland, under its criteria, was not in drought, yet there was a straight line from Barwon to the New South Wales border. Senator Ferguson's state does not declare droughts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, this is an excellent package. This is a package that, once the drought is over, can stay on the statute book because this is the legislation that can be the guide long into the future for farmers, states, federal governments&mdash;everyone.

I have not had any farming organisation tell me that it is not. It also lets them know that, at the end of that time, they will not be cast out or forgotten and will be given assistance. That is very important. That is what this bill is about. As the Prime Minister said after the election, we will extend our hand to help up those who are unemployed.

We have heard the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and Senator West talk about the $5.6 million that this government is contributing on a dollar for dollar basis matching the money raised in the farmhand appeal. When we really think of $5.6 million, we realise that it is about half of what we would pay for a good house in Sydney these days. That money has to cover all of the people in dire need and in dire straits throughout the rural areas of Australia who will not receive benefits from this drought assistance package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fair to put some things into perspective when talking about just what this package will do. Many people have been slow to realise the extent of the drought. Other very sensitive people, some city dwellers&mdash;I spoke about this earlier to Senator Cooney, and I am sure he is one of them&mdash;understand the difficulties that many rural people are going through at this particular time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West also said that one cannot prepare oneself for the type of drought we have at present. If the right incentives were provided through a properly constructed IED scheme where people could put away money for bad times such as this, they could work. Of all the various industries throughout the country, the one industry that likes least to look for any sort of handout is the tradition of the farming industry. For over a century now the farming industry has worked the land and, in many cases, has been able to put up with many hardships that people living in metropolitan areas would not put up with, although I am pleased to say that some of those hardships have been alleviated through modern technology. Farmers are prepared to live on very low incomes. They are prepared to go through very hard times and not look for a handout because there has never been a handout mentality throughout rural communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this bill addresses the immediate problems of some farmers, we need to remember that in most rural areas throughout Australia it is not just farmers who are suffering. Senator West referred to how this scheme will help inject money into the small businesses throughout Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only two weeks ago I spent some time in the worst drought affected parts of South Australia; that is, the west coast and the Eyre Peninsula. My colleague the honourable member for Grey, Barry Wakelin, is a farmer in this area and he understands the problems. He has done a tremendous job in trying to do what he can for the people in the electorate of Grey. Having been through drought himself, he understands the problems. The honourable member for Grey certainly has done everything in his power to make sure that people in the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia receive any possible help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that trip I was able to see in some of the smaller rural centres the extent of the run-down of the communities. It is not just businesses that get run down; it is total community structures. Once the community structure is destroyed through poor economic times and hardship, it never recovers. I have yet to see a small town survive which has lost its businesses, its doctor, its hospital or any major business like a machinery firm. The other day I went through the town of Wudinna where there were beautiful, almost new empty buildings which will never be used for the purposes for which they were built. In one case a machinery firm built a large building. The community is now trying to use all of these buildings for something else&mdash;in this case the development of a telecentre&mdash;to try to introduce some new skills for the people in the area so they will not be totally reliant on primary production in the future for their incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout all of these areas, unless something is done to stop the trend, I cannot see any of these small communities ever recovering. That will not help Australia as a nation, particularly as we still rely quite heavily on primary production for our export income. It will be more difficult for people in those areas to continue to function in the way that they have in the past. It is rather sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spoke to a rural counsellor in this town who has some 80 clients on his books&mdash;and this is an area that will not receive money from this Drought Relief Payment Bill. He is almost sure that after Christmas this year 33 of those clients will disappear&mdash;they can no longer be saved. He said, `I have another 30-odd ready to take their place.' That gives some indication of the extent of hardship on the Eyre Peninsula, an area that will receive no funds at all from this drought relief package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is sad that it has taken so long for a bill like this to come before the parliament because we have known for two or three years at least that farmers and primary producers, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, have been in dire straits. Yet it seems that the only way anything happens is when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) makes a visit and sees the conditions first hand. Until the Prime Minister made the visit, nothing happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could take the Prime Minister to a lot of other places that are suffering just as badly as some of the places that he has been to in northern New South Wales. Some of these places have been suffering for a variety of reasons. One area that has suffered tremendous hardship got a small amount of rain and then only three days later had a severe frost which wiped out any existing crops&mdash;unusual weather circumstances, and not the sort of weather that they normally expect. So there are lots of other things besides severe drought that can impact on people's incomes in rural areas. It is fair to say that the government has been very slow to recognise the needs of farmers in particular who have suffered over a long period of time now. By the time this package reaches those people who are suffering, they will be nearly at the end of their tether. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as help for farmers, some consideration needs to be given to providing the right incentives so that when the drought breaks and farmers become more viable there is some mechanism to encourage farmers and primary producers.

Business people could do the same thing&mdash;prepare for such terrible times as they are having now by putting aside some money via a revamped IED scheme or something along those lines.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The many good points about this Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994 have been touched upon already. Certainly the bill will be passed and become an act and will carry with it everybody's best wishes for those to whom the money will go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to add an extra dimension to what has already been said. I have been to the country&mdash;as you would well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I have been there with you&mdash;and in my youth, which seems a long time ago, I lived in the country. However, it would be fair to say that I have become very much a city person. My family is a city family and their means of earning an income are located in the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill raises issues of concern to the entire country. Senator Ferguson quite graphically pointed out how drought has affected country towns, how people and businesses have been driven out of those towns and have not recovered. I go into the country enough to know that that is true. We talk about the taxpayer's dollar and how it is expended. But another way of describing it is as the community's dollar. It is the community's money, not the government's money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Deep down, Australia is a community. That is shown in times of crisis, such as the bushfires earlier this year and during this present drought. From my own state of Victoria, a lot of feed has been sent north, and it has been done gladly. While there is not much joy to be had out of this drought, there is some to be found in this sense of community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a city dweller&mdash;no doubt I am speaking on behalf of all city dwellers&mdash;my sympathy goes out to the people who have been suffering from drought. But more than sympathy, dollars from the community's treasure chest are going out too. If the sorts of people that Senator Ferguson and others have spoken about get to the point where they are in need of help, it is incumbent on us all as a nation, as members of a common community, to help those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is wrong to call that sort of assistance a handout; it is not. It is an essential contribution by Australians as a whole to a particular section of the community. It is absolutely essential that we keep people on the land. That is a matter realised not only in this country but also in places such as Japan and Europe. In fact, I do not think that the contribution the people on the land make to this country is as appreciated here as it is in other places.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not too many city people have spoken in this debate because there was an agreement to truncate it, but I am sure that plenty of other senators would have spoken if there had been time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cooney, my friend from the other side, is quite right in saying that most of those who have spoken in this debate on the Drought Relief Payment Bill 1994 have been from outside the cities. As someone who lives outside a city, I would like to say how grateful I was to hear Senator Cooney's words today. He is a very fine person and I have a lot of respect for him. I was glad to hear that the people in the city understand what this drought is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, no hyperbole can be applied to this drought; there can be no exaggeration of how bad conditions are. This is a drought beyond hyperbole. Senator Cooney is correct in saying that the measures which are needed in the bush are not handouts. I am of the view that they are very much what this nation must do to protect a valuable investment&mdash;the strength of rural and regional Australia as our primary industry and the people living outside capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am of the view that the $164 million provided for in this bill will probably not be sufficient, but it would be churlish of me to berate the government. I merely seek the opportunity to lay on the table some very real concerns about what must be done for the period of the drought and the period following the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest anybody be under any misapprehension about how bad things are, I would like to convey something of what I have seen. I spent the greater part of last week travelling by road around some of the worst affected areas in central and northern Queensland. There were places I visited where I could not tell the road from the paddock because there was not a blade of grass. The paddocks were like crushed gravel&mdash;sad, tragic places where tough, resilient people eke out whatever they could to survive while they wait for the drought to break. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns echoed many times was that, while there was something in this package for farmers, there was nothing in the package that was seen to be of help to the working man on the property. That is a grave concern. The number of properties that used to have three or four people working on them and now have none is huge. And we must remember that, on the whole, every one of those working men represents a family which is now without income. While I know that those people are eligible for jobsearch allowance, they have a particular difficulty because, in most cases, working men on properties receive not just an income but accommodation and often a bit of tucker as well. So their families not only lose an income, they also lose accommodation and they may lose some tucker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the drought continues, the government must consider making available the money that it would otherwise have to pay in jobsearch allowance to farmers so that they can keep working men on the property. This will prevent families having to move out of on-farm accommodation and into the cities, which in most cases will mean their having to move to coastal areas. That is certainly something we need to avoid and the government must consider this aspect if this drought continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned about the effect of debt. The climatic conditions are terrible. The resilience of the cattlemen, the woolgrowers, the grain growers and all those people out there making a living from primary industry is incredible. But debt could still sink our primary industry sector unless something is done to tackle the problem. That is why I believe that it is absolutely critical and a matter of utmost urgency that the government, the banks, small business organisations and the farming representative bodies get together for a debt summit to give some consideration to debt restructuring. This is not just for farmers but also for the small business sector because incomes are drying up there as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With me last week when I was travelling around quite a lot was Mrs Deanne Kelly, the National Party candidate for Dawson. One stock and station agent to whom we spoke said, `We don't have an income because no-one is selling any stock. Our small sales of wire and chemicals are not being paid for because we are having to carry people. But at the same time we have outgoings every single week.' For the small business sector in rural Australia, this drought is as much a problem as it is for the farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we can come up with some creative ways of dealing with debt, it will be not only farmers who lose out. The small business sector will also lose out because, as farmers go off and leave bad debts, the small business sector will suffer. Then the banks will lose out by having to make large write-downs. As a consequence of that, the public purse will lose out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is critical that the government gives some incentive so that banks which want to make a partial write-down of debt can do so. Banks should be able to look at their loan portfolio and form the view that 20 per cent of their loans would be more viable if they wrote them down&mdash;10, 15, 20 per cent or whatever&mdash;and got the farmers or the small business people in a situation where they were viable and could continue after the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We may well find that when interest rate subsidies go, the level of drought induced indebtedness is such that those businesses just will not survive, even with the best will in the world. That is why I believe a debt summit is absolutely critical; it is the way forward in this community and in this country. I am not saying that banks have an obligation to write off loans willy-nilly, but there is a lot that can be done if banks, government, small business organisations and farm bodies get together and look at the problem. I believe that unless the government calls a debt summit then a crucial part of the equation is missing and this nation as a whole will suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that something is done to ensure that precipitous action is not taken against farmers whilst they are in the drought. I draw the government's attention to part 11A of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides a mechanism by which the relevant minister can effectively create a stay of execution of proceedings against farmers who are in particularly bad circumstances. I think it would be appropriate if the government gave some consideration to invoking the provisions of part 11A of the Bankruptcy Act to at least provide protection for people who are on exceptional circumstances rural adjustment. That would enable them to not worry about those extra debts&mdash;the ones not covered by any interest subsidy they receive&mdash;until such time as they start to come out of drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is terribly sad that people only need one, two or three creditors with $1,500 of outstanding debts for which they have a judgment and those people can be made bankrupt. All the good work that the government puts in can go to naught if a farmer is made bankrupt and forced off the land, and then the government is up for a re-establishment grant as well. So I believe it is absolutely critical that the government gives consideration to that mechanism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With a list of people who are drought affected and in exceptional circumstances, it makes it very easy for the relevant minister to comply with all the requirements under part 11A of the Bankruptcy Act and to give these people not a release from their debt but just a breathing space to get them up on their feet again. I am sure that these are the sorts of people who would bend over backwards, do anything and work any hours to ensure that they can repay the debts they owe. The people we are talking about who are out there struggling and scraping are the people who could have walked away a long time ago. They are there not just because they want to survive but because they have a very real intention of paying every cent they owe and doing whatever they can to look after their farms and their communities and make sure that nobody suffers as a result of the suffering which they have to endure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final point is in relation to provisional tax. My concern is that when farmers come out of drought and get their first income, they will be hit not only with tax but also with provisional tax. At high marginal rates of taxation they could be looking at provisional and income tax bills that could effectively be as high as 80 cents in the dollar, which would wipe out any ability those people had to repay their debts or even pay the interest due as interest subsidies were withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, when the drought ends the government has an obligation to look at provisional tax with a view to releasing people from provisional tax in that first year after drought. These are all real issues that the government can address, that are not going to cost the government an enormous amount of money and that would be of immense value. I believe they ought to be adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I end on a hopeful note. Everybody knows that the drought will one day end; it is just a matter of waiting for the rain. As Banjo Paterson once wrote in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">With the Cattle</EMPHASIS>, when the drought ends, it's a beautiful thing. He said:</PARA>

I hope the government will be willing to give that. I hope the government will be willing to consider the matters I have raised to make sure that this country&mdash;not just our farmers but the country as a whole&mdash;recovers from drought and goes from strength to strength. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not surprised that the government's drought package amounted to $160 million, which is significant and substantial. There was criticism of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) when he made comments about drought being part of the landscape, comments which were taken out of all context. This package shows he is concerned, as is the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) and as was Mr Crean before him, all of whom have made visits to drought-affected areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The background is that we are a caring society. We do look after people in many walks of life. People in the farming community are entitled to that sort of care, help and support. I guess people look at drought and say that drought is drought, but it is not. Drought can mean arid conditions, a lack of water. But severe drought is another matter. It is a condition which creates circumstances where suicides occur, where people lose properties that have been in the family for some generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always recall your remark, Mr Acting Deputy President, when we were on the rural and regional affairs committee. You said that as a member of the committee and as a farmer you were shocked to see in Queensland the Salvation Army putting food on farmers' tables&mdash;that you never thought you would ever see that day. Well, it did happen and it certainly brings home even more starkly the problems facing the country people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been drought inquiries which have made certain suggestions as to how drought can be managed but again I emphasise that a drought of this nature cannot be managed; it is not possible. It is a time when the whole community&mdash;as it has done, and it should be commended for so doing&mdash;should come to the support and aid of the farming community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation has been made even worse by depressed market prices. It was good to see members of the National Farmers Federation and others in the rural communities commend what the government has done. They, like others, would have liked $260 million, but there is a limit to how much money can be allocated to various areas to help industries and people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee made a point about the working men. I would not like anybody to read that and think that the only reason the numbers of workers on farms and grazing properties has been reduced drastically is drought. There has been a reduction in the number of people working on farms over some time because of better management techniques, better technology and larger machines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what Senator O'Chee said about the working men needing some assistance is valid. As with city people, they are entitled to and do get paid the jobsearch allowance. When they were seeking help from the government previously the assets test substantially got in the way of their getting assistance. In many cases where they did get assistance, it was to get off the farm. If that did not occur in a certain time, they had to pay the money back. This package does away with that, and I am very happy about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I move away from the comments Senator O'Chee made, I would like to say that I very much agree with his proposition that provisional tax should not be levied on farmers within the first year of coming out of drought. The package is there to help the farmers. I hear people say that the rural industry will become defunct and it will be a catastrophe. That is not true; it will always be there. But it would give an opportunity for large companies and absentee landlords to buy land that is currently, and has been for many years, held by family farmers. I do not think anybody wants that to happen. That is one of the important parts of the package where these people will be assisted. I think that is really great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Might I say, as chairman of the inquiry of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs into the rural adjustment scheme, that drought came very much into the evidence that was given.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and again people talked about the unfairness of the assets test and that they should have access to social service payments because their circumstances were just as difficult as those of people in the city and, in some cases, even more difficult. I think it is a great thing that we have done away with the idea of the assets test. It did prevent people from getting that payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that was raised, and correctly so, was that if the sons of farmers, for instance, or farmers themselves were to get a jobsearch allowance, they had to be prepared to go away and work at a time when their presence was required to look after the property and to see that the stock and the property were not damaged any more than they had to be. The fact that they can now get a payment and stay on the farm is very important. It is not something that just came to the minister or the Prime Minister; it is as a result of the pressure that has been put on over time by people from all walks of life in this situation. I think it is a fair set of circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to wind up by saying that I do not think some of the banks or the lending institutions can hold their heads very high because of the way in which they behaved on many occasions by encouraging people to go into debt over their heads and then not helping when the circumstances became grave as a result of people overextending themselves. But we cannot label the whole banking group as being bad because of the practice of some. I would just say that I disapprove of those who engaged in bad practices and appeal to them to change their attitude. They should be patient with people who, after all, have the potential to come good and to repay their debts. I hope that those who have been doing the right thing, and those who have even had a moratorium on the payment of interest rates&mdash;I think it might have been partly for a commercial reason, but I do not look any gift-horse in the mouth&mdash;continue doing that. I believe the package is a very good one, and I certainly commend it to the Senate. </PARA>

I appreciate the fact that most senators who participated in the debate this afternoon&mdash;and I tried to listen to as much of it as I could in between doing other things&mdash;seemed to keep political point scoring out of the debate with, I must say, some notable exceptions. But I will not dwell on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package is, of course, a package which is not yet complete; I want to stress that. We are interested in now proceeding with the next step in this package, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced at the press conference when this package was announced. This package, as it stands, is costed at $164 million but, importantly, the Prime Minister gave a commitment that the government will consider what are essentially post-drought measures that are very important in providing, as he termed it, generous investment allowances for drought proofing properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason I want to stress that, even more than the package in front of us at the moment, is that there is no question that we have to get much better nationally at managing primary production in Australia than we are now. Most members of the farming community are well aware of and fully agree with that sentiment. As I have said on other occasions, prior to 1992&mdash;when all primary industry ministers in Australia, irrespective of their political persuasion, adopted for the first time in this country's history a national drought policy, extraordinary as that may seem&mdash;and as the drought task force and the Senate committee that examined this issue clearly found, we had gone through a never-ending cycle of good seasons, bad seasons, crisis and government assistance. Then when the crisis is over, everybody goes back to doing what they were doing before&mdash;until the next crisis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very heartened by the fact that this got a lot of discussion at the special meeting of ministers&mdash;the ARMCANZ meeting&mdash;called recently to discuss the drought. There was not one dissenting voice in the room; and as you, Mr Acting Deputy President Calvert, know, and as we are painfully aware, five of those six governments are conservative, not Labor. Not a single dissenting voice in the room supported any move to go back to where we were before, to where we looked after drought as part of the national disaster arrangements. I put it squarely on the table because I wanted to hear what the other administrations in this country thought about it. Not a single person supported that proposition. Every single minister supported the notion of all governments working together to help farmers plan and manage better for drought in the future until, hopefully, we can get to that halcyon day that Peter Walsh painted&mdash;which certainly will not occur in my lifetime, but is a good goal&mdash;when all national disasters, such as drought, fire, flood, low commodity prices, frost, mouse plagues, and everything else, get capitalised into the value of the asset in this wonderful, pure economic model that Peter painted and we do not have to give farmers any assistance at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all agreed that that would be a very desirable end for everyone, including the farmers, but it is not going to occur for a very long time. However, in the meantime&mdash;while we are moving to that ultimate goal in a perfect world, which we do not live in&mdash;we all acknowledge that state and federal governments do have to devote their efforts to providing much more focused resources for primary producers to help plan for and manage these events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The farming a sunburnt country package, which was a combined effort of the Bureau of Meteorology and my department and which was released just a short time ago, contained, in some views, dramatic information. But it is a fact that across Australia primary producers make an income in three years out of 10. Of course, there are vast regional differences in that. That is a national measure across the whole primary industry sector, but it is a valid measure in considering the importance of management in this new and sophisticated age that primary producers must live in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention this because I have just come to the chamber from a meeting with the people in the departments of agriculture who developed the Rainman computer package, which we are launching in parliament next week. That package is the most highly sophisticated database of information available to primary producers on historical rainfall patterns in this country that I have ever seen. It is an extraordinarily useful package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons I mention it is that the people who are working on this are also planning the next phase of Rainman, which also plots in the areas where this sophisticated data is available&mdash;and there are many areas where departments of agriculture have kept this data&mdash;in combination with the rainfall patterns, the levels of pasture growth and grain production, and profit and loss as well. It was interesting to see a graph of a typical Queensland cattle station in a good area and to look at the plot over the last 20 years of the pasture growth patterns&mdash;positive and negative&mdash;on a typical cattle station. The thing that hits us when we look at a graph like that is that we say to ourselves, `My God, what a sophisticated and difficult exercise it is these days managing a herd on a cattle property, dealing with those peaks and troughs and deciding how many head of cattle to run on a particular paddock or on an entire property.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to acknowledge that we need to put more resources, state and federal, into helping farmers plan for the degree of sophistication that is required now. I think that an extremely useful additional step will be the delivery of the investment allowances for drought proofing properties that the Prime Minister has committed the government to providing. I want to make the point that this is not the end of the package&mdash;this is simply the instalment to this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that up to this point the federal government alone has committed in excess of $250 million on this drought, with more to come. I regret to say that there is a lot of misinformation in the community about the drought. That is inevitable but it is a little disconcerting and discouraging when we see it emanating from the highest quarters and receiving the publicity that it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note, for example, the debate that has been going on in the New South Wales parliament while we have been sitting here about the things that I am being called upon to do by members of parliament in states that are drought affected. There is a mass of this stuff but I will just give one example that has been reported by AAP. The item states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The New South Wales Deputy Premier and National Party Leader, Ian Armstrong, said he wanted the Commonwealth to give rural people some encouragement by reintroducing the Income Equalisation Deposit Scheme so farmers could put away some money to tide them over until the good times return.</PARA>

What is achievable, however, is a far greater degree of national uniformity than we have at the moment. The problem&mdash;and it is a real problem&mdash;is that there are criteria that determine drought declarations in Queensland, there is a different set of criteria in Victoria, and a completely different set of arrangements again in New South Wales. Then, of course, there are states, such as South Australia, that have no drought declarations at all. That is obviously totally unacceptable. If we cannot continue to pursue a national definition, we can at least achieve a far better measure of consistency with the way in which drought is declared in respect of government programs, state and federal.

However, we put the government on notice that, unless it is able to establish a better rationale for determining the uplift factor, we reserve the right to make amendments next year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already we have a situation in which donations of money to recognised conservation bodies are tax deductible. Those moneys are used for environmental protection purposes. This amendment simply seeks to extend that desirable facility to gifts of land. We see that as being a perfectly reasonable and sensible extension of the same principle. I think the government would be the first to agree that it is not in a position to acquire all the land that should be acquired for the purposes of environmental protection. It also would be aware that in a number of instances tax deductions are available for environmentally damaging purposes. So extending the range of tax deductibility for environmentally protective purposes would help somewhat to redress that imbalance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should any distinction be drawn between donations of money for environmental purposes being tax deductible and donations of land being similarly tax deductible? A person who owns land and who would like to see that land used for environmental protection could go through the process of giving that land to a recognised conservation body, being paid for it and then donating the money back to that conservation body. That donation of money would then be tax deductible. But what a ridiculous situation we are expecting that person to go through, because that person may then be exposed to capital gains tax if the land had improved in value and would be subject to conveyancing fees, and the full benefit of the donation made for the purposes of conservation would not be realised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons we strongly urge the committee to support this amendment and to include donations of land as a tax deduction. I point out that all the other parts of the amendment are consequential to that first one. All honourable senators need to do is understand and agree with the broad principle of this amendment to agree with it in its totality. I ask honourable senators to support that principle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We thank Senator Coulter for moving this amendment. We have put forward the need for this particular measure and such incentives for conservation for some time. It is important to send farmers the right messages economically and to make certain that the tax system reflects the other policies of government. In this case it is land care and the protection of remnant vegetation that are of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bad old days, the idea of farming and land use was that cleared land was productive while land with trees and bush was seen as useless. Measures were put in place to ensure that farming and pastoral land was cleared. Some of those were direct requirements or penalties under land laws; some of them were incentives and disincentives. The tax regime reflected those priorities and to some extent still does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now know that those older views of land and nature were wrong. Farmers know this, and that is why they have been a major force for land care, pushing the government. The result of unrestricted clearing is not greater productivity; clearing results in land degradation, salinity and soil loss, and loss of habitat for birds and other creatures that work to biologically control pests. It also has a very detrimental effect on the ecology and species generally, including effects on weather. It results in wider forms of degradation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Great Barrier Reef, like other reefs in the vicinity of intensive agriculture, is showing signs of severe stress and is dying in some areas. This is due to two factors: siltation and increased nutrients, factors which change the ecological balance that favours reef polyps over algae. The silt and nutrients come from run-off of soil and fertilisers. One method of natural control is through the use of fringing vegetation&mdash;plants that stop much of the run-off. Clearing simply exacerbates the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax laws favour clearing and disadvantage saving bush. The deductions for the value of timber felled on land in the first year after acquisition, for land where the purchase price is attributable in part to the existence of merchantable standing timber, is basically an incentive to clear. In line with this, we also support a change to section 15 of the Loan (Income Equalisation Deposits) Act 1976, which deals with farm management bonds to allow deposits to be specifically allocated for landcare purposes. Likewise, we support a measure to ensure that all tax concessions, grants and loans to farmers and farm enterprises be contingent upon the development by January 1997 of approved whole farm plans, which include targets for environmental protection and restoration and are in accord with regional biodiversity strategies and catchment management plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem for farmers is not just one of eliminating incentives to clear. We need positive incentives to retain or plant bush. As the coalition knows, farmers are having a hard time. One of the worst aspects of this is that farmers simply cannot afford to do what they know they should do to make their farms sustainable. I would like to repeat myself and say that farmers have been at the forefront in the push for land care. It is their land and their life, and they know that over-farming does not help. They have experienced the pain of seeing their land turn to salt pools and the soil blow away. For this reason, the Greens also support a number of measures designed to generate some economic gains for farmers to offset the immediate losses of over-farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support 150 per cent tax deduction for land care work. Although there is a distinct lack of figures, businesses claiming in 1991-92 at 100 per cent deductibility cost the government only $36 million. This component would be expected to cost around $54 million in total, an increase of $18 million. Section 75D of the tax act should also be amended to make additional measures, for instance, restoration of riparian zones, wetlands, costs of protecting remnant vegetation, eligible as landcare expenditure. This is a small amount compared with the cost of land and water degradation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also support a 120 per cent tax deduction for the cost of seedlings and saplings of Australian trees and 150 per cent for local native trees where these are used for revegetation or land care. This is not applicable to commercial plantations; it is dual land care/commercial use at this rate. Tax deductions for use in commercial plantations would be set at 25 per cent for seedlings and saplings of Australian trees and 50 per cent for local native trees. Australian fauna often is specifically adapted to certain flora. This is designed to aid a shift from `Australian trees', which may include those like the Tasmanian blue gum, to trees appropriate to the region which will support existing remnant animal and bird populations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter has proposed tax deductibility for leaving bushland as it is. This can be achieved by extension of tax laws which make conservation of built heritage deductible. It brings natural heritage into line with built heritage and says that natural things have value. This seems to be a minimum measure in ensuring that the tax system reflects the values of the community and the policies of government. It also seems likely that farmers who donate remnant bush that they wish to preserve understand that it will make their farms better and see this as the most cost effective way of doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, we have had contact from some farmers who are having difficulty servicing their loans at the moment. Some of them have remnant bushland which may not have a terribly high market value, but they would have more ability to sell if there were this tax deductibility. </PARA>

Therefore, if they were able to find a buyer who would preserve the remnant bushland on their land, that bush would be maintained. By that means, there would probably also be volunteers to help manage that land. Any weeding and fencing work that needed to be done would be more available through those means. It is also a means of helping a number of farmers through a very difficult time when there is land that they know they cannot farm or those who, for positive reasons, are preserving land for its natural bush qualities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government will not be supporting this amendment. In dealing with Senator Margetts's contribution, I agree with many of the points she made about the need for conservation of the environment, particularly in many areas of Australia where, incorrectly, land has been cleared and there has been obvious degradation of the environment. But I do not think Senator Margetts has read the amendment. This amendment does not provide for any of that. What it does in terms of programs specifically targeted at curing those problems is to provide for a very open-ended deductibility for land to be donated. It does not specify what should occur to that land or what sort of land should be donated. It is totally open-ended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a couple of reasons why we oppose the amendment. This four-page amendment is unrelated to the legislation before the committee. Senator Coulter has moved an amendment like this before&mdash;I acknowledge that&mdash;in a similar manner, by attaching it to a tax provision that is unrelated to the nature of the amendment that he is attempting to move. I am sure it is legitimate; there is nothing illegal about it. But in terms of assessing a proposal that is open-ended and could cost tens of millions of dollars, it is not the correct way to assess something of this nature. We do not know the cost of this measure to the budget. It could be $10 million, $20 million, $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the earlier argument, I would make the point that this land may not be land that needs attention. We could donate any land. That is one of the critical weaknesses of Senator Coulter's proposal. It is not a reasonable way in which to target what may be necessary and what I accept we need to be doing in many of these areas. But surely if we are to provide finance via way of a deduction&mdash;whether it is $10 million, $20 million, $100 million or more&mdash;we should work out to which areas of this country the assistance needs to be directly targeted. We are very sceptical about very open measures of tax deductibility that do not have appropriate checks and balances. This government has funded a number of programs. Landcare is an obvious and very successful one that has been acknowledged by all, right across the environment and primary industry sector and across all political parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For those reasons, we cannot accept Senator Coulter's amendments. I welcome the principle put forward by Senator Watson that we will not accept it in the House of Representatives.

I think that is a welcome statement in that it would indicate that the minister is prepared to think about or talk about within the government moves in the future which do have a program worked out. I know that a number of groups put such submissions to the government, for example in the process last year, including the Australian Conservation Foundation and so on. The information is in.

This is indeed a minimal measure, but we know full well that when we have tried more ambitious measures, more courageous measures, there is very little chance that the government will support them. So, one puts up minimal measures in the hope that the government might have the sort of courage that the Whitlam government had in 1972.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been in the conservation movement long enough to have battled long and hard right through the 1950s and the 1960s to get section 75(1)(b), as I recall it, in the old tax act, in relation to tax deductibility for the clearance of land, modified. It took years and years and years, and when Mr Whitlam became Prime Minister he had the courage to radically change that section of the income tax act and to significantly modify it to restrict tax deductibility for the clearance of land. I just wish that the present government had that sort of courage, but we do not find it. When we put up a minimal measure&mdash;and I thank Senator Margetts for that assessment&mdash;we find that the government still cannot support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary secretary has said that this is open-ended. What a lot of nonsense! We have a long list of bodies to which donations are tax deductible. What happens if Rupert Murdoch, in his sudden magnanimity, decides to give $100 million to the Australian Conservation Foundation as a tax deductible donation? It is not likely to happen, but the process of making donations to bodies tax deductible is open-ended. The government has no idea whatsoever what donations are going to come in, and so it has no idea what the effect is going to be on the total tax take. To attempt to draw some distinction between land and money on the basis of open-endedness is clearly ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw Senator Sherry's attention to the section at the bottom of page three where one of the amendments says, `The environment minister and Treasurer may classify as a natural heritage conservation organisation' and so on. It clearly gives the minister the power to determine that those bodies that are legitimately accepting land for proper conservation purposes are bodies within the meaning of these sections. Clearly, that provides to the minister and the government the two controls that are necessary: firstly, that the land is legitimately to be used for conservation purposes; and secondly, some control on the so-called open-endedness. I really do not think that the government has put up any argument in relation to this. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No.1&mdash;Clause 129, page 75, at end of clause, add "and provide for sales tax credits in respect of parts used in re-manufacturing goods sold to or leased by exempt users".</PARA>
<PARA>This clause affects sales tax and what are known as remanufactured goods in Australia which are sold to exempt users. The coalition amendment will provide a sales tax exemption for parts used in the remanufacture of goods sold or leased to exempt users, such as government departments, schools, libraries and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment is necessary for two main reasons. Firstly, the existing treatment of remanufactured goods was not apparently intended by the new sales tax legislation and is inconsistent with the sales tax treatment of both new goods and imported remanufactured goods. Secondly, the current treatment is a disincentive to the burgeoning local remanufacturing industry. Remanufacturing plays a beneficial role in the Australian economy. I thank the Greens and the Australian Democrats for their support for this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will encourage the remanufacturing industry, which has great potential for significant future growth. There is growth in the overseas demand for remanufactured goods, and Australia's remanufactured goods are substitutes for the new and remanufactured imported goods. Of course, there are also significant employment and recycling advantages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht's comment in a public hearing some time ago was that the government would have further discussion with the industry about the issue. That was encouraging and I therefore find the government's response tonight somewhat disappointing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the bill the government is extending the availability of sales tax exemptions to parts used to repair goods to be exported. The coalition amendment goes one step further and follows the logic in the same direction. It will therefore restore the status quo of the sales tax position as at 1 January 1993. It is no good for the government to say that for decades the law was unclear because the law operated very clearly in relation to this issue. The restoration of the sales tax exemption, while generating significant benefits for the economy and encouraging the use of recycled products, will have a very minor impact on revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the second reading debate I expounded the virtues and the necessity for the support for this measure. Because of the lateness of the hour, I will not reiterate those arguments but I refer this chamber to the second reading debate. I ask honourable senators to support the amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We think the goods should have been made to last longer in the first place, and I think this will encourage manufacturers. It is important to note that this sales tax exemption is being sought only for the non-taxable sector. It should result in a reduction in the price of goods by encouraging remanufacturing. Charitable and educational bodies will be able to obtain photocopying, photographic and other equipment at a much lower price. That will enable those bodies to release funds for other purposes, and I think that is an important principle. </PARA>

The remanufacturing is a labour intensive process, not a capital intensive process. This means that the substantial cost of refurbishing the photocopier is labour, not the parts. In fact, labour comprises 85 per cent of the value of the remanufactured goods. So, for that reason, the point made about the substantial reduction in price is just not correct.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provision has been made for a sales tax credit to be given where spare parts are used in repairing goods for export. This follows amendments last year in relation to spare parts used in repairing machinery that is ultimately sold to farmers, miners and manufacturers. Xerox and other companies are seeking a sales tax credit on spare parts used in repairing remanufactured goods that are ultimately sold to exempt persons such as government departments, schools and libraries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is opposing the amendment that the opposition and, obviously, the Democrats and the Greens are supporting. There is nothing in the structure of sales tax in Australia which requires a credit ground of the kind being sought. It is simply an extension of a concession, that is, the concession given to government and benevolent bodies to not pay sales tax on goods they use. The basic design of the sales tax system is to tax the output of manufacturers; that is, the sales tax is a tax on goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To avoid double taxation, the inputs of manufacturers are exempt from sales tax because their value is picked up in the outputs which are taxed. But the inputs of service providers&mdash;for example, the tourism industry&mdash;are taxable because they do not produce other goods which are subject to tax. Thus, the tax free status of inputs to service providers such as government departments and hospitals is a concession which the opposition amendment seeks to extend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic impact&mdash;and I have already partly dealt with this&mdash;of providing the credit ground would appear to be very marginal at best. I have already outlined some issues in respect of that. It is material to note that sales of remanufactured goods to tax exempt users is only a part of the picture. In fact, around 60 per cent of sales of remanufactured goods are to taxable users. Australia positively discriminates in favour of local remanufacturing where sales are to taxable users. Imported remanufactured goods are subject to sales tax on their whole value when sold to taxable users. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Goods previously used in Australia which are expected to be repaired and then re-imported are subject to sales tax on the new parts and labour component of their value when sold to taxable users in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already argued that the cheapness of the sale price arising from this is very minor. It is not minor in terms of the tax the government is going to lose. I will come to that point later. There are administrative complexities in having credit grounds on parts used in second-hand goods. Given the marginal benefits of providing the credit ground, the government is not inclined to add to the costs of operating the sales tax system. The opposition frequently criticises the government for the cost of the sales tax system. The opposition is proposing to make it more complex.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no guaranteed way of ensuring that the benefit of the credit ground would flow through to the end users, in which case the credit ground could simply be a transfer from the Commonwealth to the bottom line of the remanufacturers. That is where the money will go. There are literally hundreds of good ideas for not charging sales tax on certain goods. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the people listening to this debate and the Senate that the government gave a clear undertaking when it introduced streamlined sales tax that people who were exempt prior to the new arrangements would not be subject to tax under the subsequent arrangements. The purpose of this amendment is to keep the government honest to that undertaking, which it is now attempting to walk away from. The government is now arguing that it is losing millions of dollars of tax. It never had that tax, so this is a new tax. It is breaking a promise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Sherry of the comments he made last year in relation to the amendments to assist producers in the mining and agricultural area in relation to repairs for cash. This draws my attention to a failing of the government at the time to include the leasing arrangements. Farmers in this day and age cannot always pay cash. They increasingly are entering into leasing arrangements. I draw Senator Sherry's attention to the major problem with that amendment at that time. If he is going to be consistent, he needs to address that issue to include the leasing as well as the payments in cash in the mining and agricultural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask Senator Sherry, on behalf of the Labor Party, to honour his undertakings. Effectively the government is casting aspersions on the quality of its purchasing officers in the various exempt areas because they are unable, according to the government's criteria, to push a case as to whether the reduction in sales tax arising from this would be passed on in the form of lower charges. That argument is a reflection on the ability of purchasing officers to negotiate and to be aware of the components of the cost structures. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clauses 156 to 159 concern the Royal Flying Doctor Service. During the second reading debate I pointed to the anomalous sales tax position which exempts from sales tax only the purchase of transceivers which are used `mainly' for communicating with RFDS. I strongly urge the government to review this situation. Not unlike the sales tax anomaly which I spoke to a few moments ago with respect to the parts used in the re-manufacturing of goods, here is another example of what I call the streamlined sales tax revenue regime failing to accord with the old sales tax law. I remind Senator Sherry that the commitment I am referring to was not a government election commitment but a commitment made in relation to the transition from the old sales tax regime to the new sales tax regime, which came into effect on 1 January 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the `for use mainly' test in the current legislation has the unintended effect of removing the exemption for wireless transceivers used by most people in remote areas for maintaining contact with the RFDS for emergency medical assistance. I remind honourable senators who were listening to the Ian McNamara program on Sunday when they were raising lots of money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service of the eloquent service that is provided by that organisation and the reliance of these people in the outback on these transceivers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I gave a notice of motion and subsequently also asked the Minister for Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) a question urging the government not to sign the United Nations convention on desertification tomorrow as this government plans to do&mdash;and with very good reason. There has been an overwhelming response to the Liberal and National parties' committee of inquiry into the United Nations convention on desertification. Among the many and wide-ranging submissions, not one supports the signing of this convention without reservation. There are a few who do not oppose the signing, but even they believe that there should be much greater community consultation before signing and are implacably opposed to ratification should the government determine to lodge a national action plan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator Faulkner, in reply to my question concerning the government's precipitous signing of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, stated that he did not give a damn about the coalition's inquiry. That comment from the minister is simply another reflection of the arrogance with which this government treats the Australian community. There should have been a full-scale Senate inquiry into the government's intention to sign this convention. That was a motion that I put to the Senate some weeks ago. It was only narrowly defeated&mdash;by two votes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry not having been established, the Liberal and National parties, aware of the enormous community concern about the proposed signing by the government of this convention following the conclusion of treaty text negotiations in June of this year&mdash;community concern which I am sure Senator Panizza is also aware of, representing as he does the rural areas of Western Australia&mdash;determined that we would conduct our own inquiry. Therefore, we set up a committee of inquiry which consisted of me as chairman, Senator Kemp, Senator Crane, and Senator O'Chee from the National Party. The coalition believes that it is important to permit Australian individuals and groups an opportunity to present legitimate concerns about this treaty and to provide a forum for that to occur, given that this government in its arrogance failed to consult adequately with industry groups, with state governments and with rural communities potentially affected by this treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The results of this coalition inquiry have more than justified the parliamentary party's decision to establish it. In stating that he did not give a damn about the coalition's inquiry, the minister has effectively thumbed his nose at  those who forwarded submissions to our inquiry and agreed to willingly participate. The minister has effectively told those people&mdash;individuals, and some significant Australian companies and industry associations with a wide cross-section of membership&mdash;that he does not give a damn about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the companies and organisations that have made submissions to this coalition inquiry are the National Farmers Federation, a number of the state divisions of the National Farmers Federation&mdash;such as the South Australian Farmers Federation, the New South Wales Farmers Association and the Victorian Farmers Federation&mdash;the Australian Mining Industry Council, the district council of Mt Remarkable, CRA Ltd, Kidman Holdings, the pastoral company, and the Country Women's Association of NSW. The list goes on and on. These are the people about whom Senator Faulkner says he does not give a damn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is staggering that the government, in the face of this massive opposition to its actions in signing this treaty, has chosen, with this extraordinary display of arrogance by the minister, to ignore the message coming from these people of some significance in the Australian community. Perhaps part of the blame lies with the media for not drawing the attention of this issue to those Australians who live in the coastal regions rather than the inland, more isolated areas. Perhaps some of those people living in coastal regions may not be aware of the significance and the potential impact of this treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This treaty might not be as headline-grabbing an issue as sexual privacy but let me say to this Senate that it essentially deals with the same issue. That issue is the centralised grab for power by this government&mdash;in the case of the desertification treaty, to wrest control of rural land management from state governments. The central issue is the use, yet again, of the external affairs power to enact legislation to take away the management of problems which are best left to local communities to solve, to people who are close to the problems and who can assess which techniques may best be used to suit unique local conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is hard to imagine a more ludicrous situation than a government department bureaucrat, comfortably ensconced in a cosy Canberra cavern, setting policy for outback Northern Territory, far northern Western Australia, which my colleague Senator Panizza represents so well, mid north-west Queensland or, indeed, the western areas of New South Wales that my colleague Senator Woods from New South Wales represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my own state of South Australia, local government councils are aghast at this prospect. It is beyond the imagination of farmers in the mid-north of South Australia to conceive of how these people could have the gall to dictate policy to them from Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue&mdash;the fundamental weakness inherent in treaty negotiations of this sort. Parameters which may initially be set by the federal government at the beginning of negotiations are rarely re-examined during the treaty negotiation process. Each negotiating session results in a markedly different text to the one on which the government may have set its original parameters. Negotiating teams are left to protect the nation's interest as the texts alter and only report back to the government at the conclusion of each negotiating session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A small group of people on the negotiating committee are therefore left to battle with protecting Australia's national interests, often in an arena where Australia's traditional United Nations negotiating blocs and allies, due to different trade and economic structures, may not have negotiating positions consistent with our own. All this is done without reference to the parliament or even the cabinet. The dangers or challenges of these treaties often cannot be foreseen and the impact on Australian domestic policy, including trade implications, should be fully investigated prior to signing. In the case of this treaty, this government has simply failed to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my understanding that the current Treasurer, Ralph Willis, will undertake the signing on behalf of Australia at the opening ceremony in Paris on 14 October, which is tomorrow. The Treasurer is undertaking this task apparently because he will be in the area at the time. The government is perhaps to be commended on its restraint, and I applaud the economy of multi-tasking in designating the Treasurer to sign this treaty rather than perhaps Senator Evans or Senator Faulkner taking another overseas junket to perform this function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly hope that Treasurer Willis does not make the same mistake as the lately departed environment minister, Ros Kelly, at the Rio Earth Summit. She signed for Argentina instead of for Australia, the only similarity being that both begin and end with the letter `A'. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth making one final point: the treaty cannot be ratified until a sufficient number of countries have signed it. The best guess by foreign affairs experts is that this process may take up to six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to close with a question for the government: why has there been such undue haste in signing this treaty? It would be better for the government to delay signing it until such time as the government can better explain the impact this treaty will have on Australia and Australians and at least make some attempt to alleviate the genuine, legitimate concerns which Australians have about this treaty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Experience with the climate control convention has shown that the government clearly does not understand the implications of these treaties, nor can we meet our obligations under them in time. There are often hidden impacts which may take years&mdash;and a High Court decision&mdash;to be revealed. Surely the government should learn from its mistakes. There is every reason for us to urge it to do so. The only reason that one can possibly give for the government signing this treaty tomorrow is that it wants to grandstand at the opening ceremony for the sake of international popularity. That is simply not good enough when, as I said, the Australian community has many concerns about this treaty. The signing ought to be delayed until some later period. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to address one of the most important issues in Australia today&mdash;homeless youth. In particular, I want to focus on and talk briefly about one of the great workers in this field, Bill Crews. Bill is the minister at the Uniting Church in Ashfield, which is in my former electorate of Lowe. He is a delightful fellow and one of my great heroes. He came to Ashfield some years ago and I think it is fair to say that he sent some shock waves around that local church which was, until then, the average local Uniting Church.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill Crews decided that Christianity should be not only theological but practical and, as a result of his work in this area, he set up the Exodus Foundation. The Exodus Foundation essentially offers food and shelter to homeless kids. He has worked tirelessly on this particular project and has turned it into an example of what Christianity should be and sometimes is not&mdash;that it should not be a dry theological religion by itself; it should a religion in action, a religion helping the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill has demonstrated to the Uniting Church in Ashfield what I might call Christianity with its sleeves rolled up. Bill devotes every waking moment and, I suspect, every sleeping moment too, to this foundation. If in my lifetime I achieve a fraction of the good for the community that Bill has achieved already, I will be justifiably proud of my existence and I expect my family would be too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the issue today is a sad one. Two weeks ago, Bill had to close his refuge for homeless kids. Why? There are essentially two different reasons. The first is a reduction in funding from private sources. Bill has done a fantastic job throughout the recession in raising enormous amounts of funds to keep this project going, to reach out to literally thousands of homeless kids and unemployed and disadvantaged people in the area. He has performed minor miracles but for some reason the funds have recently dried up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I plead for help for the Exodus Foundation. I say to any company or individual, rich or poor, who has a few dollars to spare&mdash;particularly if they have a lot of dollars to spare&mdash;there is no better cause to donate to than this worthwhile cause. I am sure that this view is widely shared. I know that my colleagues currently in the chamber certainly share this view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot emphasise what a wonderful job this foundation does for the community. It is absolutely fantastic. So I plead&mdash;almost in desperation&mdash;for the community to open up its pockets and donate money to this foundation to rectify the problem. I am proud to say that all the profits and income of the New South Wales Premier's cocktail party&mdash;that is, John Fahey's Liberal Party cocktail party&mdash;will be donated to the Exodus Foundation. Even though that may be a small gesture, I am delighted to be part of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason the refuge was closed relates to government. This has happened in a number of different ways. The first relates to the bureaucracy. The bureaucracy has interfered in the caring of homeless children. It used to be a simple matter. Bill used to do it in a nice, simple fashion. He used to offer shelter, food, support and counselling. He did it, I think it is fair to say, on a shoestring but he did it remarkably effectively. I think the results of his pastoral ministry speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then the bureaucracy got involved. The bureaucracy put in regulations, red tape, requirements and forms&mdash;most of which was unnecessary. The regulations that now have to be followed in this area by people like Bill Crews mean that something like $4,000 per homeless kid has to be spent per month&mdash;mainly to meet the requirements of the bureaucracy. Bill can provide shelter and food for something like $10 a day, so there is a great discrepancy there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bureaucracy is requiring social worker support and other such things, many of which are very desirable. But it has become counterproductive when the requirements of the bureaucracy are such that refuges such as Bill's are being forced to shut down. I have to say that the bureaucrats in this regard are all too often raising barriers rather than lowering them. They are excluding people rather than including them. There was a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by Amanda Meade who, in reporting on some issues, indicated that something like 40 per cent of the needy were still sleeping on the streets in spite of the apparent investment in homes for those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bill rightly pointed out that it would be cheaper to send the homeless kids to a high cost, first class, upper level boarding school than to care for them in the way the bureaucracy wants. That is a terrible indictment of the bureaucracy. But there are more problems and, again, sadly they are with the government. One is the difficulty of accessing government funds. Today, Bill said to me, `They just keep changing the rules. They tell us to put in applications on appropriate forms, so we ask for the forms. Then they tell us the forms aren't available because they are being redrafted and reprinted. We then ask to get into the system anyway, only to be told, "You can't get into the system unless you have the applications on the proper forms; and the proper forms are not there." It just goes round and round in circles. If you are already in the system you are okay; but if you are not in the system, it is very difficult to get into it.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very recently, the foundation was told that there was no more funding available for the next two years. It is clear, according to sources in the area, that there are people in that system who are known to be doing a substandard job but they can get extra money from the pool because others, who may have better plans, cannot get into the system because of all the red tape. As Bill describes it, it is an unbelievably frustrating bureaucratic nightmare. I emphasise that Bill is the most reasonable of men. His views on this matter are to be taken with the utmost seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another indication of the problems he has faced is that at the back of the Uniting Church in Ashfield there is a building which is rather like a gym or a warehouse. It is nothing very fancy. It is financed, if I remember rightly, by Burns Philp. My commendations go to Burns Philp for investing in this. It was planned to be a crisis refuge but it cannot be opened as a crisis refuge because the bureaucrats have said that to be a crisis refuge there cannot be a dormitory arrangement; there have to be two separate dormitories. There have to be partitions; there have to be privacy arrangements. Because of that, the kids who would be sleeping in this refuge are not allowed to go there. Instead, they are sleeping in the gutters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unbelievable that there is not enough commonsense in the bureaucracy to realise that whether or not there is a partition is of no great moment when the alternative is sleeping in the gutters amongst the addicts, the thieves and the muggers who are outside. To meet the requirements of the bureaucracy, the foundation would have to spend another $20,000 to $40,000. It is such sadness. It breaks my heart to see people like Bill and his wonderful team of volunteers working their hearts out, to have it thrown back in their faces like this, by an uncaring bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still a problem. I do not know how big it is. Seven or so years ago, Burdekin told the country that something like 25,000 people are affected. There seems to be no doubt that there is still an ongoing problem. Bill told me that only last night a doctor called and drew his attention to the plight of a woman and her five children. They had been living in a car since the recent death of her husband. Bill sorted things out. As he said, the organisation gives priority attention to the plight of kids. It is basically into providing food, shelter and support. But it cannot get the bureaucrats to realise the enormity of the problems. They continue with their tail chasing and buck-passing and invent new ways of stopping people from accessing government funds, rather than helping people to do the work and to deal with the realities of the problems in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, as I understand it, spends over $100 million in this area but, sadly, it is not effectively spent. If people like Bill Crews have to close down a refuge, it is the worst possible indictment of government expenditure and management that I can imagine. There is a duplication because the system is organised and run by the federal bureaucracy and implemented by the state bureaucracies. So, on top of that, we have duplication in this area. How anybody could imagine that would be effective is beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a system where the nature of the regulations means that it costs $20,000 a month to put through the four or five kids and youths that Bill was looking after before. It had managed to operate for 12 months and that project almost sent the Exodus Foundation broke, in spite of all the fund raising and hard work that Bill and his volunteers are doing. They had to close the program to enable them to keep operating in other ways in the community. They followed all the rules for their refuge and that is what made it expensive. They followed all the rules, but they could not get the money. They were between the devil and the deep blue sea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be nobody really caring about the plight of the kids in the system. It fills me with embarrassment to be part of a supposedly great, leading nation in this world which has a problem like this on its own back doorstep, where kids could be easily looked after, cared for, fed and housed and yet they are not because of the bureaucracy not really caring about the real world, only about their own comfort, their own empires and their own promotions. I say to the minister responsible, Brian Howe, a man who claims to have compassion in these areas: show some of that compassion and some of that commonsense and fix this problem. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TITLE>Port Hinchinbrook Development Project</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="1720" SPEAKER="Woodley Sen J." NAMEID="HX5" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.41 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak on the Port Hinchinbrook development because I believe there are still questions which need to be answered. I would like to place on the record some of these questions and some of the background which makes me ask and continue to ask questions about this particular development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions is to do with legal advice that we understand the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, may have received on the extent of the Commonwealth's powers to intervene in the construction of the Port Hinchinbrook resort. I believe that many of us would like to see that advice. We would like to know what the advice says. We would like the minister to release that advice. That is the first matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give the minister credit that he has made some effort to try to protect native forests, for example, in states such as Tasmania, but I do want him to act to protect this precious site in Queensland. So another question I ask is: will he do this to the extent of the powers he has?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I give Minister Faulkner credit that he has insisted on adequate scientific studies to be carried out in the Hinchinbrook Channel, which is part of the World Heritage area, before approval is given for dredging. However, there does not seem to be recognition from either the state or federal governments of the problem of allowing construction of the resort to go ahead while assessment of the impact of its operations is still being undertaken. What is going to happen, I ask, if construction continues for another six months and then the evidence comes in to show that World Heritage values of the area will be significantly affected?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that the developer insists on not changing any aspects of his development, although I give him credit for reducing the number of beds from the original proposal, will we be faced with a half or fully built resort which is, quite justifiably, refused permission to operate? Honourable senators can see the problem. Will the Queensland government, which has done all it can to push this development through, be prepared to pay compensation for the expenses incurred by the developer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unclear whether the baseline study of the Hinchinbrook Channel, which is required by the federal minister, will be adequately carried out. The Queensland environment minister talks of a study which will be concluded in a few weeks and which is being carried out by the Department of Primary Industries, which can hardly be seen as an independent or objective participant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I need to place on record the lack of confidence I have in the processes presently and formerly undertaken by the government. I have a letter, obtained under freedom of information, from Mr Williams to the Coordinator-General's department dated 15 April 1994. It is his comments on the environment report. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the meeting on Wednesday night, 13th April, at which Chris Pattearson, Jan Bimrose and I discussed major issues as contained in the document I have now had the opportunity to fully consider the contents of such document and Jan Bimrose has already received by fax my comments and suggestions which must be incorporated before it is released to the public.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My suggestions for amendments to the report are not negotiable on the grounds that I am not about to embark on this major project with skeletons in the cupboard that I will have to argue about at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators can see how concerned someone could be that Mr Williams should have had such input to what I would have hoped would be a totally independent document. Mr Williams further states in his letter to the Office of the Coordinator-General:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I stated earlier in this letter that I am not negotiable in regard to my requirements for an amended document and, furthermore, I am not negotiable in regard to the date established for the issue of permits (6th June, 1994).</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, Mr Williams concludes his letter to the department by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the above I feel that I have unshakeable grounds for insisting that such delays as have been caused by non compliance of the grounds rules established should be compensated for by shortening the time from closure of public comments to the issuing of permits.</PARA>
<PARA>I also quote from the fax from the Coordinator-General to Mr Williams responding to his letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your two facsimile messages . . . and a third facsimile message of 15 April 1994, in relation to the draft Environmental Report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your comments and requests have been examined in detail and the following changes made to the document . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I wish I had a little more time to read those changes, but perhaps another occasion will suffice. Honourable senators can understand the concerns that we have when we discover that Mr Williams had such a significant input to the writing of that environment report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another concern which has been expressed is the pressure from the influx of people into the area. Many people are worried about this. Contrary to statements made by Mr Williams, many of these people come from Cardwell and the surrounding areas. I will quote from just one of the letters that I received today. It is a letter to Senator Kernot. The gentleman who wrote this letter is a former overseer for the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should a channel be allowed, people pressure alone will be devastating to the small islands of the family group, including both Gould Is. and the Brook Island group, Hinchinbrook Is. in particular would suffer from the effects of visitation, it would be a tragedy to see this beautiful island (degraded) because of too much visitation. Qld NP&amp;WS have a system regards limiting the number of campers on an area at any one time, but this does not apply to day visitors, so large numbers of people can use an area daily with tragic results. I was o/seer in charge of island parks in this local area from 1972 until 1988 and saw first hand, damage that can be done to areas with only light visitation . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I received a phone call from another gentleman who was born in Cairns, who lived in Cardwell in the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s and who still visits the area regularly. He says that it is a marvellous area, and I concur in that, but he believes the environment is under pressure from people being attracted by the development. He says that a large number of people in Cardwell are not convinced about the development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me conclude by saying that construction of this oversized resort is happening today, yet all these questions are yet to be answered. It will soon be too late. I urge the minister to visit Hinchinbrook and to use all of his power to convince the Queensland government to start playing by the rules. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Yes. All AON material, upon initial transfer to another country, or after a re-transfer to a third party, is subject to international Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards, and verification of non-diversion is carried out by the IAEA. Under our bilateral safeguards agreements the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO) accounts for all such AON material as it moves through the fuel cycles of, and/or is re-transferred between, Australia's bilateral partners. Detailed documentation on transfers and re-transfers, and regular reports of each bilateral partner's holdings of AON material are provided by the ASO. By comparing reports with its own calculations and by conducting regular `reconciliation' visits to each bilateral partner, ASO verifies the AON material is properly accounted for by them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Yes. The transfers and re-transfers of AON material between the jurisdictions of Australia's bilateral partners are reported each year in the Annual Report of the Director of Safeguards.</PARA>
