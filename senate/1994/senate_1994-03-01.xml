<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to Senator Richardson, who seems to be being returned as the senior minister for sports rorts. I remind the minister of debates in the Senate in October 1991 regarding the grants under the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program in which the minister confirmed that the department did not handle the distribution of these grants. He said, `I did. It was done from my office'. I ask the minister: why was this program not determined and administered in the usual way&mdash;that is, by the department making recommendations on agreed guidelines? Why did the minister politicise the program in that way?</PARA></TALK.START>

We changed that a little later to $13 million over two years, with the permission of the relevant ministers. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the way that the program was administered, as I think I explained in 1991, it was administered from my office in the same way as it was from Mrs Kelly's office. Although I outlined the procedures in the Senate last Tuesday, in the three days since no honourable senator has sought to ask me a question about my administration of the scheme. There were some differences between the way that Mrs Kelly and I administered the programs, but it was done from my office. Given the extraordinary demand of $200 million worth of requests for $13 million worth of grants, I do not believe there was any satisfactory way that we would have been able to do it in any event.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not been the minister for every portfolio, so I am not sure that I can answer the first part of that question. This program was certainly different, and I outlined the way in which it was and the massive amount of requests that we had in those years. We uncovered an enormous unmet need, and we had a very paltry amount of money to meet it. No matter who allocated it, therefore, he or she would have been the subject of considerable criticism. As I said in my answer last week, one could have drawn up 10 lists separate from the ones I did and still justified every grant in them. So I do not believe that there was any way, with that massive demand for such a small amount of money, of satisfying everyone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As all honourable senators will know, particularly those from rural areas of Australia, this is a sensitive issue for the Australian wool industry and has been for a long time. A number of key controls are currently in place under the federal government's merino export policy. Merino ram exports from Australia are restricted by a quota, and the export of ewes, embryos and ova is embargoed. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has completed a detailed discussion paper on this policy, based on extensive analysis of the potential impact on the industry of any change in that policy. Copies of this discussion paper will be available from my department later this afternoon.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Health. Yesterday Mr John Langmore stated in the House of Representatives that the fact that marginal Labor seats received considerably more funds under Mrs Kelly's sports rorts program provided a very strong inference of political bias. Why should Australians not believe that an equally very strong inference of bias exists in relation to the minister's distribution of grants considering that, in 1989-90, 74 per cent of grants went to only five seats in Queensland which just happened to be marginal Labor and, at the same time, not one grant was awarded to a Liberal held seat in Queensland?</PARA></TALK.START>

How far does the recent agreement between North Korea and the International Atomic Energy Agency on the implementation of nuclear safeguards inspection go towards satisfying international concerns about the DPRK's nuclear activities?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A team of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, is scheduled to arrive in the North Korean capital of Pyongyang today to resume the agency's nuclear safeguards activities. This development follows months of difficult negotiations between the two parties on terms for the resumption of inspections. The inspections are designed to provide a basis for assurance that the DPRK's declared nuclear sites have not been used for weapons related activities since IAEA inspectors were last there conducting inspections&mdash;in August 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia welcomes the DPRK's decision to cooperate with the International Atomic Energy Agency. We look to it now to ensure this and subsequent inspections proceed without hindrance. We await the report of IAEA inspectors with great interest. The inspection will take about two weeks, and further time will be required for the analysis of samples of nuclear material taken from DPRK sites.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A satisfactory outcome would be an important first step towards North Korea's full compliance with its safeguards obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. The DPRK's level of cooperation on the nuclear issue will be monitored closely by the IAEA board of governors, which is presently under Australian chairmanship. The commencement of the inspection had been delayed until the conclusion on 26 February of working level negotiations in New York between the DPRK and the United States about the timing and content of the third round of high level talks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Completion of the initial resumed inspection will meet a key condition for those talks. North Korea has also agreed to resume dialogue with South Korea on an exchange of special envoys&mdash;the second condition for the talks with the United States. Another expected element is announcement of the suspension of the annual US-South Korean `Team Spirit' military exercise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that the US-DPRK high level talks will provide the basis for a long-term settlement of the nuclear issue which must, of course, include the DPRK's full compliance with its nuclear non-proliferation treaty obligations, involving in the longer term a resolution of the question still outstanding about North Korea's undeclared nuclear waste sites. The talks should also help to promote cooperative relations between the two Koreas and facilitate the DPRK's gradual and positive involvement in regional issues.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Prime Minister Keating said in response to a question in the House of Representatives on 3 February, this whole matter of North Korea's nuclear status and activity is of the highest security significance to the region as a whole and indeed to Australia. We remain committed to dialogue and negotiation as the best way to resolve this issue, but we would also support stronger international action, including action by the Security Council, if the DPRK does prove unwilling to move towards full compliance with its NPT safeguards obligations.</PARA>

We have a very large talent bank but the question remains as to how we will move to rearrange ministerial responsibilities in areas where there is, on the face of it, a degree of overload.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the magnificent government whip for his question!

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1980s, the Department of Defence identified a need to improve the methods of propeller measurement during the production in Australia of replacement propellers for the Fremantle class patrol boat. This led to a search for a tolerance measuring system that would confirm that the propellers were within specification. Ryan Marine Products was identified as a potential supplier for a suitable system, and the department assisted the company in developing equipment to meet the navy's specific needs. A prop scan measuring system was supplied to SS Engineering in Perth with the support of the department. This was used for the successful completion of the contract for the manufacture of Fremantle propellers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to measurement during the manufacturing process, there is a need for measurement of propellers while ships are in service. A contract for the development of a ship afloat propeller measuring system was awarded to Ryan Marine Products under the defence industry development program. A trial on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Geelong</EMPHASIS> in August 1990 indicated the prototype system was suitable, and the equipment will be further developed for wider naval use. The department has provided assistance from the defence export program to Ryan Marine in overseas marketing, including the provision of staff to accompany Mr Ryan in demonstrating his measuring systems to customers in the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ship-borne equipment will be loaned to Ryan Marine for demonstration to potential clients in the US and Canada, where there is also significant interest in this project. As a result, the equipment has, for the second year running, been approved for investigation by the United States navy, in the Pentagon's foreign comparative testing program. Ryan Marine Products should be heartily congratulated on this achievement.

For all the talk here today, it is interesting to note the comments of the Queensland government on the grants that Senator Herron and Senator Parer found so offensive. In the majority of cases it was unable to comment and had no adverse reaction to any of the projects on the short list that we sent except one, and we did not fund it. So occasionally we have to remain calm about these things. That was a government that Senator Boswell knew a bit about. In those days it was not the Goss government; it was run by Bjelke-Petersen.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Media reports earlier this week outlined the case of a small Perth company linking with the Finnish mobile telecommunications specialist Nokia to develop state-of-the-art telecommunications base stations. What role did the government play in helping this small Australian company enter the global marketplace?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has a partnerships for development program, which is part of our general information industry strategy. The purpose of this program is to target overseas companies which are going to sell more than $40 million worth of equipment in Australia in the telecommunications area, in software and in services, to either the Commonwealth government or the state and territory governments, and to then encourage those companies to partner with Australian companies so the Australian companies do a large proportion of their local work in manufacture and assembly. As well as that, they develop an export plan from Australia to overseas, particularly in our target markets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After seven years they are required to have 70 per cent local value added content in their product. That is what the partnerships for development program does. We have an example now of the major Finnish communications giant Nokia, a foreign company, forming a partnership with ERG, a Perth company specialising in communications technology. They were joined under the partnerships for development program. It is worth noting that in 1985 ERG had 10 staff on its payroll; it now has 450 staff, the partnership deal having been done in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the Nokia partnership came along for ERG, ERG had annual sales worth $12 million. That was in 1991. This year its financial projections are that it will have sales of $110 million. That indicates that this program is working.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the agreement with Nokia, ERG is building the next generation of telecommunications base stations designed specifically for tropical environments. Australia is an ideal location for this sort of technology. ERG has commenced building earlier model base stations for Nokia and exported about 100 of these units to the Asia-Pacific region. The new units are designed to operate in extreme climatic and other conditions. The units are the first to integrate everything into a single cabinet, including power supply and electronic equipment. This cabinet allows the unit to handle extreme temperatures and also makes the unit vandal proof, thereby enabling it to be sited in remote areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The initial focus for export for this company will be Australia and New Zealand markets and there is scope, according to the management of the company, for exports in the Far East, in the Middle East and in the Mediterranean area. As well, the city of Fremantle figures in this export success story too. Fremantle has an important role in this because the Fremantle Port Authority has lent its lighthouse as a site for the proving and development of this technology. ERG has installed the global systems for mobile&mdash;GSM&mdash;on Fremantle Port Authority property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why it chose the Fremantle Port Authority is that it provides the sorts of conditions which can simulate conditions in the market targeted by this company. It is open to rugged wind conditions, it is open to extreme temperatures, and, of course, it is a salt infected site, an ideal location to prove up the hardiness and robustness of this Australian technology developed in association with a multinational giant. I know that Senator McKiernan, a Western Australian senator, is interested in that.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think we should recognise this as another major step in the government's policy of recognising the value of intellectual property and the role it will play in our becoming an internationally competitive economy because trademarks are a very important part of that. The proposed trademarks bill is an outcome of a working party which reviewed the legislation. The working party was made up of nominees from the Institute of Patent Attorneys of Australia, the Law Council of Australia and the Trade Marks Office. While this legislation represents a broad range of opinion, the government believes that it is important legislation, that it has great consumer and industry interest, and that the draft bill should be made available to the public for a six-month period before the government makes a final decision on the content of the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

The issue was also discussed last week by officials of the European Union and officers of my department. The situation is not as clear as given in the ABC report. Unfortunately it was, once again, sensationalist and wrong. The evidence from the European Commission is that the situation here is evolving. The list produced by the commissioner, although admitting there are some problems with it, is one that he expects will change.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One main reason for our position is that, despite periodic bleatings from members of our community, there has been a bipartisan acceptance of the fact that we need to have visas issued offshore. We have a system in Australia which is working quite well and quite effectively, and we are building on it. Officers from my department are able to explain to European officials that work is already under way for the introduction of a facilitation scheme for travel into Australia. For instance, on 22 June 1993 I wrote to various ministers advising them that development work had begun on a new electronic visa issue system which was designed to simplify entry into Australia from our most important tourism markets in Asia, North America and Europe.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new system has the objective of extending delivery systems in high volume, low risk tourist markets and providing ready access to almost all travellers from participating countries. We expect it will be put in place over the next two years. It will be virtually invisible to tourists. No written application will be required and no visa will be placed in the passbook. The application to enter Australia will be made by presenting a passport to an authorised agent who will seek the authorisation to travel electronically, in much the same way as the agent presently makes airline accommodation bookings. The entry authority will be electronically provided to the agent, and the details will be presented in the traveller's itinerary.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arrangements will be extended to nationals of countries with a specific tourist profile.

The reaction so far within Australia from governments, industry and travel information specialists has been favourable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some supplementary information to add in relation to questions asked of me last week&mdash;on 23 and 24 February&mdash;by Senator Gibson about my role in relation to access to ASIS personnel files. The main thrust of Senator Gibson's questioning and of my reply concerned a particular report on an officer's spouse, access to which was initially refused but subsequently granted to the officer. I have nothing to add to my answer in that respect. Certain material was not shown to that officer in an initial internal investigation but was shown to him in a subsequent internal investigation in 1991. But the initial withholding occurred without any decision or knowledge on my part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While my recollection was quite clear on that matter, and confirmed by a subsequent file check, I did ask ASIS to make a complete check of all submissions made to me on personnel matters over the whole of my five-year-plus period as foreign minister so that I could make absolutely sure I had not misled Senator Gibson or the Senate in any way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That check has turned up one other matter, and one only, which I should put on the record to avoid any possible misunderstanding. I did receive a note last November from the Director-General of ASIS asking me to note and support a suggestion that he had already made to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security that the inspector-general, in turn, recommend that a particular officer be counselled not on the basis of a nine-year-old report by an ASIS psychologist, in relation to the release of which there were both some legal and medical issues remaining to be resolved, but rather that counselling should proceed on the basis of the inspector-general's own recent dealings with the person in question.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reviewing that submission, which I did endorse at the time `Noted and agreed', it occurred to me that it could possibly be argued that, in that indirect way, I was somehow acting to deny the officer in question access to the nine-year-old report file. That is not the way the issue was presented to me for decision; it is not the way I recalled reacting to it at the time. Moreover, in a follow-up communication a few days later, I did indicate by way of annotating a note from a staff member that the question of access to that particular document was one on which I would accept ASIS's judgment.

<PARA>One could barely call Senator Richardson's response an answer. I point out to the Senate that it is not only in relation to sports grants that this government, and the Australian Labor Party generally, have been guilty of very poor conduct in the distribution of grants to groups in the community; that conduct also extends to grants given under the local capital works program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During question time, I raised with the minister the question of a grant made to the Wynnum Manly Rugby Union Club in Queensland, a suburban Brisbane club, where $100,000&mdash;not of sports grants money but of local capital works program money&mdash;was given to that club. That local capital works program was designed to create a fiscal stimulus, so it was said, or in other ways create employment in areas of very high unemployment, and it was also meant to create infrastructure of lasting community value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the programs that have received money were things such as community halls, bike ways, drainage and sewerage projects&mdash;infrastructure projects of major community value. But in this instance the Brisbane City Council, which did not really fit the guidelines of the local capital works program, got a special grant from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Brisbane City Council is a Labor controlled council and a very political council in Queensland. It did not fit the guidelines for the local capital works program, so a special grant was made to the Brisbane City Council. Out of that special grant, the Labor controlled Brisbane City Council then allocated certain amounts of money supposedly for these infrastructure projects of lasting community value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise to find that most of the money in the Brisbane City Council went to Labor marginal seats in the Brisbane metropolitan area. You would not be surprised, Mr President, when I tell you that it did happen. The money went to seats such as Moreton, which the Labor Party was fearful of losing at the last election; Lilley, where the popular sitting member had retired and a new non-entity from the Labor Party was coming into that seat; and Rankin, where Mr Beddall was under very serious challenge from Sallyanne Atkinson. Is it surprising to find that most of the capital works program money ended up in those seats?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular instance, some of that money went to the Wynnum-Manly area of Mr Sciacca's seat where the rugby union club benefited from the largesse of both the federal government and the Brisbane City Council. It did not go to the rugby union club for a community infrastructure project of lasting value. It went to extend a building of the rugby union club so it could get a seven-day a week liquor licence and put in poker machines&mdash;hardly an infrastructure project of lasting community value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also had the effect of sealing off from the general public a part of Elanora Park on the seafront at Wynnum. For many years that park was used freely and openly for recreation purposes by the general public. It is now being shut off by the rugby union club as part of this project to increase the size of its bar and its poker machine area. It probably will not come as much of a surprise to the Senate either to find out that the Wynnum Manly Rugby Union Club is controlled by prominent members of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all fits together. That was a special grant to the Brisbane City Council by the Commonwealth Labor government in the run-up to the federal election. It was then allocated by the Brisbane City Council&mdash;a very political council&mdash;not for ordinary infrastructure projects, but for this project which, as the Liberal candidate in the Wynnum-Manly ward in the city council election points out quite correctly, is one that is totally opposed by residents of the area because of the noise and the loud parties that are carried on there, and because the park, which was previously open to the general public, has been restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Jenny Mansell, the Liberal candidate, is conducting a major campaign to try to do something about that decision.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that Senator Richardson missed is that the direct quote from the Auditor-General's report was not the Auditor-General's statement; it was the statement from the honourable senator's own department&mdash;the department that he controlled in 1990 before handing it over to Mrs Kelly. Now that the apprentice has been bowled over, the sports grants have been given back to the sorcerer&mdash;the man who, in 1990, handed out largess, not only to Labor marginal seats but also to the environmental movement, which he subsequently dumped after using it purely for political purposes. He was the mastermind behind this whole sports grants affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson made remarks to the effect that we took the matter up four years ago, but `it didn't really run anywhere'. For some reason the media itself took the view that pork-barrelling was a legitimate part of the political process. Yet this sort of expenditure of taxpayers' money is blatantly corrupt. There is no other way it can be described. It is about spending taxpayers' money simply to buy votes, and not on the basis of need where there are competing claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example of the figures we used when Senator Richardson was the minister. In my own state of Queensland, 74 per cent of the total grant in 1989-90 was given to five marginal Labor seats in the south-east corner, plus the two seats that the ALP hoped to win in North Queensland&mdash;Dawson and Kennedy, which were then held by the National Party. The end result was that the National Party hung on to Dawson, but the Labor Party at the time won the seat of Kennedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to look at these figures because here we find some interesting names. We find some poor old characters from the ALP side who actually missed out because they were out of favour. Let us take a look. Mr Lavarch was the then member for the marginal seat of Fisher. He is now the Attorney-General. He was involved in a recent sports rort through Mrs Kelly. He was involved back in 1990 when, with a 0.6 per cent margin, he received a hefty amount. Mrs Crawford was the member for Forde, a marginal seat at the time, which received a major grant of $90,000. Mr Courtice was the member for Hinkler, another marginal seat, which received a major grant. Mr Courtice subsequently lost that seat at the last election, which goes to show that pork-barrelling does not always work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gary Johns, now a parliamentary secretary&mdash;they are all getting their rewards&mdash;was the member for Petrie, which also received a major grant. Leichhardt, held by Mr Gayler at the time, received a major grant, as did the seat of Rankin held by Mr Beddall, another minister. Who missed out?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot say that these grants were given to seats just because of need, because a seat which would have need is Bowman. Guess who the member for Bowman is? It is Con Sciacca, and he was out of favour. Do those opposite know how much the seat of Bowman got? Apart from the fact that it was not a marginal seat, it received zero. These people are ruthless. They do not care about those in need. If the seat was safe, it got nothing. It had to be a marginal seat.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say in regard to this minister and to this program is that if it walks like a duck, flies like a duck and quacks like a duck, we have every right to believe it is a duck. </PARA>

Clearly what Senator McKiernan has said&mdash;and I listened to him earnestly for the first minute or so&mdash;has no reference whatsoever to the question that Senator Parer asked or the question before the chair.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite forget that when the minister brought down those statements some years ago they went through a process in both houses of parliament, through our estimates committees and through our standing committees, and they were bereft of ideas in questioning. They do not know how to ask questions; indeed, they do not know anything about being in government. They have been on the opposition benches for so long that they have become comfortable in that position&mdash;so comfortable in fact that in another proposal that they are beating up at the moment they are looking after themselves for future years. That is a debate for the future. </PARA>

No wonder those opposite do not want to change, but the reason they do not want to change is that they are not willing to think.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the remarks made by my colleague Senator Parer. It is very clear that before the last election there were two main legs to the Keating strategy. One was to say anything at any time to lie his way into office. As a consequence we had the big lie that this government would not increase taxes. We all know what happened soon after Mr Keating got back into office.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other leg to the strategy was to pour vast amounts of taxpayers' money into Labor marginal seats. Thirty million dollars of taxpayers' money was, by and large, poured into Labor Party seats in order to try to support the candidates in those seats. In some particular seats, of course, the results were spectacularly successful. The seat of Swan is a classic example, where almost $1 million was spent and Mr Beazley just managed to sweep back into office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue how elections and democracies are conducted. Senator McKiernan shows the arrogance of the Labor Party. Probably one of the most important acts in any democracy is the election. The conduct of that election should be fair, and fair to all sides. Particularly people in our profession should be held accountable for the things they say and do. I believe 1993 will go down in Australian history as one of the most disgraceful elections that we have seen&mdash;where the Prime Minister would say anything, and where taxpayers' funds were used in a politically corrupt fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But where do we go from here? I believe it is time to look closely at the whole pattern of conduct of the Labor Party and the way it goes about its governance of this country. It is essential that there be a proper inquiry into the sports rorts affair. Was Mrs Kelly acting alone, or was she in a sense the fall person for other Labor senior ministers and for members of the Labor Party headquarters? Was Mrs Kelly basically set up to take the blame to protect others who were just as culpable as, if not more culpable than, Mrs Kelly in this disgraceful affair? It is worrying that the Democrats are still very equivocal about whether they will support a proper inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you will recall in relation to the Marshall Islands affair&mdash;Senator Gareth Evans is in the chamber and he will recall that affair extremely well, as he got up day after day and defended himself and Senator Richardson&mdash;that there were major issues involved and it was appropriate at that time to have an inquiry to find out precisely what went on. One has to say that Senator Evans and his colleagues did a pretty good snow job then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister went over to the Democrats and Senator Coulter and said, `Let's not have an inquiry into the Marshall Islands affair and into what precisely happened. Let's look ahead and look closely at the conduct of ministers. Let's set up a committee to do this'. I believe the Democrat party room was divided, but Senator Coulter, in his lack of wisdom, decided to buy the government line. I believe that was a great pity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is emerging now is the same sort of thinking: `Let's not go back. Let's not see how far this cancer has spread throughout the government and how low the ethics of the Keating Labor government are. Let's look ahead'. Today Mr Keating said, `No longer will we have programs where grants are determined in a minister's office, as with the sports rorts'. That is what he said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to relate the Western Australian situation. Senator Richardson has repeated what he said back on 11 December 1990, that a large percentage went to marginal Labor seats, `But that would not have been a consideration'.

Virtually all of the money went into that seat. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not agree with Senator Baume's interjection. A number of people at Senate estimates committees, year after year and leading up to last year, painstakingly analysed these grants through the estimates committee with no interest at all from the people in the press gallery. We got the odd article here and there; one or two over the period of four years. But, of course, the great thing that came out of those estimates hearings was that the Auditor-General picked up the case and had a good look at it. Of course, that shows that the Senate estimates committees achieved a worthy objective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Senator Richardson was in charge of this program four years ago, there is no statute of limitations on ministerial accountability. A minister cannot say, `I got past the election because you did not catch me out four years ago'. There is no statute of limitations on ministerial accountability. The Democrats want to go along and say, `We're not going to have an inquiry. We're not going to go back four years. We'll have a little powwow with Mr Beazley'&mdash;one of the people who actually benefited from this sports rorts program&mdash;`about some accountability reforms'. If they want accountability, they will have an inquiry into this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister really believes that there was a need for those facilities in the electorates of Swan, Stirling and Canning&mdash;there certainly was a need there, a need to hang on to those seats&mdash;why was there no need in the seat of Fremantle? I have been to Fremantle recently, strangely enough. I have been out to suburbs such as Spearwood, Palmyra and a whole load of working class suburbs where Australians are doing it tough on the ground. They did not get any money from this program. They did not get any money last year. In fact, I wonder why the people of Fremantle bother to keep electing Labor members of parliament. They come across here, often ending up in the cabinet or in the ministry, and forget where they came from and the people who voted for them. Fremantle missed out because it is not a marginal Labor seat&mdash;although after next weekend it will either be a marginal Liberal or a marginal Labor seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seat of Moore, held by Allen Blanchard, was redistributed into a notional Liberal seat. Sorry, Allen Blanchard&mdash;he is probably forgotten now, poor old Allen. Allen missed out and the people of Moore missed out. There are lots of new suburbs and no facilities in that electorate. But George Gear and Kim Beazley got the money because there was more need in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the seat of Cowan. The government had given up on Cowan in the 1990 election. Poor old Carolyn Jakobsen did not get any money either. The minister stuffed up a bit there. He thought that Carolyn was going to go in 1990. She hung on and did another three years. She finally went this time. Cowan had been written off. Was there need in Cowan? Again, there are lots of new suburbs, a lack of infrastructure and sporting facilities in that electorate, but there was no money for Cowan. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party thinks there is more need in the suburbs of Swan. Most of the suburbs of Swan have been there since the colony of Perth was founded. There are cricket grounds, football grounds and tennis clubs all through Swan. But it says there is more need in Swan. The electorate of Perth missed out on almost all funds in 1990 because it saw Perth as a safe seat. The only needs in this program were those to re-elect the Labor government and spend taxpayers' money to achieve the cheap political objectives of this government. The reality of this government is that it is prepared to do and say anything to stay in power. The other reality is that these people are arrogant and out of touch&mdash;and are not accountable. That is what this opposition demands of this government; that it be accountable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last evening at 7.20 we had a new President in the chair and new standing orders of this Senate. I noted that the new President very zealously endeavoured on that occasion to meet the requirements, even though I was desperately trying to indicate to him that I had approximately half a minute to a minute to finish my particular speech in this second reading debate. I will therefore have to reiterate a little of those comments and also conclude the remaining part of that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation that is before us, it was necessary to canvass a whole range of matters that address this particular issue. I had, in my main speech, endeavoured to cover those points that were so necessary. I had reached the point of referring to the necessity for ongoing study and research in the chemical-veterinary area, and pointed out that a wise and sensible use of chemicals has an important role in maintaining agricultural production and, at the same time, helping maintain the quality and diversity of our soils. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian agriculture is an enormous employer of technology and modern methods. For example, an Australian company is seeking permission to run field trials of cotton plants which have been genetically engineered to improve their resistance to caterpillars and, paradoxically, the herbicide roundup. The company is confident that if the trials are successful and the plants are released commercially the chemicals that are used on Australia's very substantial cotton crop could be reduced. Such advantages are not limited to broadacre farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sheep industry is awaiting the commercial availability of transgenic sheep, which are resistant to the sheep blow-fly&mdash;a pest responsible for significant losses of wool production in this country. As a community we are right to carefully monitor the nature and use of chemicals in agriculture but should not be blinded to the enormous benefits to farmers and mankind. They already help our rural sector to do more than just feed Australia. They allow that sector to feed and clothe some 55 million people globally, bring in billions of dollars of export every year and employ hundreds and thousands of Australians not directly involved in primary production in our biggest manufacturing sector, the food processing sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I briefly note the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs handed down last week, and to which Senator Sherry made a brief government statement last night. The government basically accepted the thrust of that report. The committee recommended in its comments on this particular package of bills that the legislation be reviewed after 18 to 20 months of operation. I am pleased to note that the government accepted that recommendation. The review should address such issues as public access to information; cost recovery, including community service obligations; and third party appeals and control of use after sale. I also indicate the federal Liberal and National parties agree with these findings and support this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats are gravely concerned about this package of bills. As Senator Tambling has told us, it is an historic package. Each bill in its own right has an historic effect. But in the view of the Democrats these bills fail to meet the standards and procedures required by new national uniform registration systems for the nation's chemicals. I am disappointed to say that the bills are inadequate. But I am not seeking the immediate banning or abolition of all manufactured chemicals and compounds in use for agricultural and veterinary purposes. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again place on record my disquiet as to the way that we, as a society, have built a reliance upon using chemicals, not only in agriculture, but in our kids' classrooms, our homes and workplaces, with almost total disregard for the consequences in terms of health, economics and eventually the employment and structure of our nation. If that seems to be going a little too far, we should think very carefully about the way chemicals have inveigled their way into our society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we have become addicted to the idea that we must continue to be throwing more and more poisons at our food in ever increasing quantities in order to feed ourselves and pay for our insatiable thirst for importing products we do not need or could grow and manufacture quite well ourselves. Over time we have been lulled into a false sense of acceptance towards the ever expanding use and reliance on chemicals by industry and government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The newsletter <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Farm Chemicals Today</EMPHASIS> provides us with a good example of my point. It is basically a propaganda sheet from the chemical industry designed to calm people's growing fears about chemical use. A recent edition, for example, has Australia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . ranked amongst the world's safest food countries.</PARA>
<PARA>It is all very well, but it is not good enough. This is reinforced by the government departments and agencies now busily trying to foster the image of clean, green, produce. We have to be very careful about the superficial use of such words and look behind exactly what we mean when such statements are thrown about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is only one side of the story. We do not need more and more chemicals; we do need to be using fewer and fewer chemicals. Despite clear warnings, more pesticides are being used in more countries on more crops causing more damage today than ever before. Global pesticide sales have, reportedly, increased a huge 31 times since 1960. From cradle to grave, from production and use to storage and disposal, pesticides pose increasing threats to human life and the environment which sustains us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that damages from pesticide use alone costs more than $100 billion worldwide yearly. This has to be contrasted with the claimed beneficial use of chemicals in agriculture. These costs are hard to enumerate and justify in some ways. It is because as a society we have not really undertaken a cost-benefit study into the real cost of using them and the real benefits. One thing we do know is that part of the cost is the ever increasing regulatory and control mechanisms. This package of bills introduces yet another aspect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already there are monitoring authorities and tools such as the National Food Authority, residue surveys, market basket surveys and so on, which have already been put in place to protect ourselves and our children. These costs eventually arrive at the consumer's wallet. There is no other place that they can be met from. Honourable senators will recall that over the past year, since I related the incident of schoolchildren in Tasmania being sprayed with chemicals, I have brought a continuing catalogue of disasters resulting from chemical use or abuse. I am pleased to say that the efforts I have made there have encouraged more and more people to speak out against this modern threat to our existence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A story a couple of months ago concerned a man around 30 years of age who accidentally drank endosulsan and as a consequence is now dead. What kind of regime do we have to put in place that can register such stuff for public use?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill, I know, knows better than to think that such an interjection about someone who drank some 2,4,5 T and is still alive is a worthwhile contribution to the debate. The fact is we have registered such materials for public use, when there is no known antidote for some of them. The opportunity for misuse is easily taken. At the moment we seem to be more concerned about building safety fences around backyard swimming pools, which communities around Australia are enraged about; we have been subjected to decades of discussion and great wringing of hands to ensure that the right regime is brought into place. But in dealing daily with potentially fatal chemical compounds we do not seem to be getting quite so worried about it in a regulatory sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some honourable senators will be aware of the furore created by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission's decision to aerially spray atrazine around young plantation pine trees at Lorinna, northern Tasmania, to retard weed growth. In answer to a question on notice, Senator Richardson has informed me that atrazine is no longer approved for use&mdash;presumably meaning banned&mdash;in Sweden due to concerns over possible water contamination. He also maintains that atrazine does not pose a health risk when used for the same purpose in Tasmania. There is something about the antipodean traversing across the equator, something like the Norwegian liquor that we saw where some magical effect took place when it went over the equator. I am sure that does not happen to atrazine. If it is not safe in Sweden, it is not safe in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's escape hatch is the ubiquitous maximum residue level circus, the MRL, which is the level of chemical residue expected to occur in foods when a chemical is used as recommended but has nothing to do with the contamination of a town's water supply. Why do we have a system that has to wait for an outbreak of atrazine poisoning to be traced back to the spraying at Lorinna in the backblocks of Tasmania before we take the hazards of chemical use more seriously? Why is that? Why do we not recognise it? Is it because the words are so complicated? Is it because the effects are so complicated? Is it because it is so easy to cover up misuse? I do not know. I think those questions need to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not long ago the Victorian government was obliged to pay compensation to farmers who used dieldrin in the recommended way. As honourable senators will know, the dieldrin beef contamination scandal was the catalyst for the establishment of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals which reported in July 1990. I remind honourable senators that that committee was established by the Democrats and included Senator Coulter, who performed a very valuable task in ensuring that the committee followed the matter through and reported to the Senate. </PARA>

We know, not only from the work of that committee but also from public information, that the organochlorine DDT is used for termite control in Queensland even though its use has been prohibited there since 1987. Residues of DDT were recently discovered in beef carcasses meant for export to Japan. Apparently, some of the contaminated meat came from a feedlot on a site that some time ago was a dip site; other meat came from sites that were previously sugarcane fields.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the many questions that arise from this instance is: how many contaminations are waiting to happen throughout Australia? We do not know exactly where these sites are. People who are preparing produce for sale overseas are sometimes ignorant of what their farming property was used for previously. This ought to be of concern when we register chemicals but I am not convinced that this legislative package will resolve the problem. There have been numerous reports and examples of contamination of food and severe toxic effects of chemical applications on populations. Reports are now emerging of toxic effects of chemical usage in schools and industries. Honourable senators will recall that I recounted the episode of the Dalton Special School in Hobart. It is no longer a school but we still do not know the chemical application that caused the problem at that site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier in this Senate session I told the story of one Pat Snowdon, the victim of chemical poisoning from her previous occupation as a cleaner using the glycol ether, ethylene glycol mono-butyl ether. Glycol ethers have been linked with miscarriages, reproductive damage, central nervous system damage and adverse effects on liver and kidneys. Glycol ethers, at this very moment, are being used to clean schools and many other public buildings. Why do we continue to allow that use? I do not know, and I do not think this legislative package is going to solve that problem either. Although people have been calling for a review of that chemical for many years, we still have an allowable exposure concentration well above allowable levels in the United States. There, new rules have recently been proposed for the reclassification of glycol ethers by the Environment Protection Agency. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on current data, the EPA is not able to establish molecular size or weight above which there are no concerns for adverse effects on human health.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it could not determine a minimum. I could go on in this vein for days&mdash;I am sure honourable senators would be very excited about the content of my speech&mdash;but I do not need to do that to demonstrate that we do have a very large problem that requires attention. To be fair, these bills hint at recognising the problem. My disappointment is not so much with their content nor even their direction, but with the fact that, although they address the problem, they do not solve it, and that is not just my opinion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee which inquired into the bills heard genuine concerns about them. The chairman of the national registration authority endorsed some of those concerns and had serious concerns of his own. I propose to move a second reading amendment which expresses his concerns. I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">",but the Senate calls on the Government to make provision for funds to be made available for the National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals, to enable it to perform community service obligations essential to the evaluation and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products".</PARA>
<PARA>I find it strange that the chairman of the NRA can express the concern that there is no provision in this bill for funding to meet community service obligations, yet it is in no way addressed in this package. The committee understood his concern and recommended that it be part of the review in several months time. We have talked about the decades it has taken to reach this point&mdash;the negotiations, the exposure draft, the discussions that took place with state governments and the preamble to this bill. If we did not address a basic concern of the chairman of the NRA, what was the purpose of putting together such a package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other concerns were picked up by the committee and acknowledged by the minister, and I note the promise of a review of the legislation in 18 months time. I support that recommendation. I consider it a reasonably cheap promise for him to make&mdash;a concession that the government was able to make rather painlessly in this position. In the meantime, whether or not that is picked up in the review process, I will ensure that the operations of the authority are closely monitored. It is not just me doing this, but the people who have been expressing concerns for decades about how Australia has been sucked along this path of the use and misuse of chemicals. I will ensure that the results of that monitoring are put on the public record for its ongoing monitoring and as a starting point of the promised review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really second best. This legislation had a chance to be based on a foundation of proper ecologically sustainable development principles, but they are not even spelt out properly in the bill. The bills should provide for the implementation of those principles, not just superficially mentioning them. I will be providing a simple amendment that attempts to give recognition to the principle that we should be precautionary in our acceptance of new chemicals. If we must unleash more and more of these products into our environment, we must be sure there will be no adverse effects; it cannot be any other way. We should be precautionary in our introduction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills provide for a public record to be kept. This could be properly databased and contain all the relevant information on products and their constituents. It might yet turn out to be so. It could also be used to maintain incident and usage information. That usage information could detail the history and geography of usage and provide a national accessible poisons schedule in a user friendly format. This is one aspect of the legislation I will want very carefully watched. I believe that the bills fail to provide a proper monitoring capacity. So far, the argument about control of use has been used as an excuse for the failure to ensure that the NRA is required to monitor the effects of the chemicals it registers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was presented with a feasible system of feedback and proper monitoring. I will be moving an amendment that makes it clear that the NRA should be seeking feedback from the public about the effects of chemicals, consistent with the conclusions of the 1990 Senate select committee findings. It is nonsense to suggest that it is sufficient to register chemicals and not be required to have some responsibility for the effects of the use of the chemicals. A complete lack of systematic monitoring of the levels or effects of agricultural chemicals was lamented by a number of the bodies that presented submissions to the Senate select committee on agriculture, including the Bureau of Rural Resources, the Australian Conservation Foundation and the Victorian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said about openness and transparency. Indeed, I think the chairman of the NRA did acknowledge the cynicism with which this legislation is viewed by many people. Such cynicism, it is said, derives from past practices and, to his credit, the chairman indicated that it is the NRA's intention to do better, to be more open. I remain to be convinced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note the intention to address the issues of public access to information and the responses about the concerns over the commercial-in-confidence issue. For the moment, I will be content with an amendment that assists making the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth of Australia</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> the vehicle for providing public notification of government activity. If we are serious about the public's right to know, this amendment will receive bipartisan support. It only requires that it be published in daily newspapers as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee did pick up on the concern about third parties. However, restricting applications for variations of approvals for registration to narrowly defined applicants unnecessarily excludes the public from this process. I will be moving an amendment that is designed to overcome that problem. My view of this legislation is that it really ought to be withdrawn and redrafted to take account of the concerns expressed last week at the public hearing. I cannot understand why, after so many years, there are still so many uncertainties and concerns about this package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the hearing we heard a submission that called for the board to include the appointment of an additional director who has experience in ecology and environmental protection. I moved such an amendment when the board was originally established in 1992. It was opposed. Yet at the hearing we heard again the argument that the current arrangements provide for environmental expertise. If that were really the case then the bills would be different, they would look different and they would contain the amendments I have already alluded to which were first moved in December 1992. The legislation is certainly inadequate and it cannot receive my support without substantial amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This package of seven agricultural and veterinary chemicals bills has been a number of years in development. The Senate established in November 1988 the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia. I was deputy chairman at that stage and you, Mr Acting Deputy President Colston, were the chairman&mdash;it is good to see you sitting in the chair while these bills are being debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was charged with examining: the adequacy of arrangements under the existing legislation relating to agricultural and veterinary chemicals for administration and coordination systems for agricultural and veterinary chemicals; the efficiency of chemical, non-chemical and integrated management systems; and the economic, social and environmental impact of those chemicals on Australia. At the time of the inquiry there was much concern about the indiscriminate use of chemicals in Australia, the lack of information about the toxicity of chemicals, and the inconsistency of registration of chemicals&mdash;many of the things about which Senator Bell has just been talking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was thought the committee would be unable to bring down a consensus report because of the differing political views of the members of the committee. History will record that, in fact, the committee's report was unanimous. The committee made 45 recommendations relating to improved mechanisms for registration and research funding for an industry that was not well regulated, not cohesive and in need of improvement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The select committee report was a blueprint for the management of farm chemicals and agricultural products. And for reasons known best only to the department of primary industries and to the government, the government response to the report took two years to formulate. The agricultural and veterinary chemicals committee brought down its report four years ago and we are at last seeing the legislative processes suggested in that report. Senator Tambling said in leading this debate for the opposition that we welcome the bills that have been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The package of seven bills will, in essence, provide a uniform, transparent, one-stop-shop national system of clearance and registration in accordance with the original committee's recommendations. It provides the National Registration Authority, which has been developed since 1992, with the legislative powers to function; amends existing legislation; and introduces a levy on agricultural and veterinary products manufactured in Australia and a levy on those imported into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I support the thrust of the legislation, it is not perfect. It does not cover as many issues as it ought to. The government needs to examine the question of chemicals a lot more thoroughly, most particularly from the user point of view. It should also be examining ways of achieving better control from the point of sale. The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, which looked at these bills, made this pretty clear in its recent report. That area remains untidy and open to difficulties and needs to be thoroughly considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, my view is that something is better than nothing. I am hopeful that the National Registration Authority, having been given some legislative teeth, will start to work. That is also the view of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs to which this legislation was referred. As it happens, I now happen to be the deputy chairman of that committee. The secretary of the Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia is now the secretary of the Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. So it is very much a case of revisiting a lot of the arguments. In looking at the legislation in the last few weeks, we have actually received quite a depth of information about agricultural and veterinary chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural and regional affairs committee report tabled last week supports the thrust of the legislation, with the reservations that I have just mentioned. Interestingly, the witnesses who appeared before the committee this year expressed similar views to those expressed many years ago to the select committee. The National Farmers Federation welcomed the legislation, saying the consultative process to develop the legislation was `very thorough'. The NFF said that it was highly supportive of the legislation because:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It contains much of the tried and proven elements of the existing registration process while adding essential new features, including proprietary rights to registration data and provision for registration of minor uses.</PARA>
<PARA>The federation suggested that the legislation provided:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A much more transparent and open registration process that will provide greater public certainty that concerns about health and environmental safety have been thoroughly considered . . . The bills strike a reasonable balance between the transparency of the process, availability of information to the public and the need to protect costly and commercially valuable information that is submitted as part of the registration process.</PARA>
<PARA>I note that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, said yesterday that the government will ensure that the main interest groups are kept informed of relevant agricultural and veterinary chemical matters; and that a direct mailing list is to be developed so that these groups will be advised by a consolidated notice from the NRA and, consequently, they will not need to hunt through daily newspapers looking for notices. People in the community like Senator Bell, who has been making points in this place, will have a much better expression of views of what is happening with that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Associations like the Australian Veterinary Association Ltd also support the legislation; but the AVA expressed concern about the after sale use. I might add that the legislation did not cover control of after sale use because the federal government, in consultation with the states, had agreed that it should remain with state governments to administer the control. Maybe we should be working with the state governments to see whether they can agree to change that a little bit. The AVA submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To illustrate the serious difficulties that can arise, in most States (but not all) it is not an offence to use registered products at higher dose rates than recommended on the label or in species other than those listed on the label, eg. products for sheep can be used legally in pigs. Furthermore, some States have different controls on veterinary medicines and pesticides for external use on animals.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, if we could get the states all agreeing to other things, we would actually get a much better, friendlier use of chemicals in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same concerns were raised by the Veterinary Manufacturers and Distributors Association. It made particularly valid points in suggesting that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">VMDA . . . has been of the opinion that the control of use should be in Canberra and that it should be a Commonwealth function . . . State lines on a map are completely irrelevant as far as the use of remedies, applications, herbicides and pesticides are concerned.</PARA>
<PARA>Concerns were expressed as to the cost recovery mechanisms proposed under the legislation, and manufacturers suggested that the cost of chemical registrations could conceivably rise 250 per cent. However, they acknowledge the importance of such procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of cost recovery, I draw to the attention of the Senate that in 1992 there was to be a 50 per cent cost recovery, increasing to 67 per cent in 1993-94, and then reaching 100 per cent in 1995-96. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other criticisms about the legislation came from groups such as the public interest advocacy centre, and environment groups such as the Australian Conservation Foundation, who said that there had been a lack of public consultation, and that they had received the legislation&mdash;a package of some several hundred pages&mdash;only in October last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PIAC suggested a number of amendments to the committee, including changes to the composition of the NRA board. However the chairman of the National Registration Authority, Professor Ben Selinger, told the committee that acceptance of the amendments would require negotiations to be reopened with the states, and the whole process would be delayed. That sums up the dilemma for the committee in proposing any amendments to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believed that the legislation should be implemented without delay, but it also believed that it should also be reviewed. We are recommending that the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation should be reviewed after 18 to 20 months of operation, which gives us a chance to find out any teething problems that may be attached to it. However, I do not think there will be any problems. I think the NRA will do a good job with the legislation. We want to make sure that there has been public access to information, as was intended, and that there has been the cost recovery, which I have just mentioned, including community service obligations, third party appeals, and the control of use after sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked for a commitment on that from the minister, and he gave us that commitment yesterday through the parliamentary secretary, when he said that he was happy to agree that the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation be reviewed after 18 to 20 months. I think that is excellent because it does not do any harm to look at some of the legislation that goes through this place to see whether it is operating in the way in which it was meant to operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators know, Senator Bell issued a dissenting report to the committee's majority report. I think it is regrettable that the senator felt there was need to do that, because I am quite confident that the proposed review will encompass many of the matters he raises while, at the same time, giving the legislation an opportunity to start working. Senator Bell said that 18 months would be too long to wait but, in fairness, the NRA needs to be given time to operate, and having waited years to get the legislation in place, I do not think it is unreasonable to wait a further 18 months to see whether what is in place is functioning adequately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the suggestion that the NRA board be changed to include an environmentalist, I have no objection per se to an environmentalist being on the board. But where do we draw the line? Should we not have a vet, a doctor, a horticulturist? On the other hand, why do we have a television personality on it? The fact is, for whatever reason, that is the composition of the board. At the end of the board's term there will be an opportunity to change the membership if it is deemed appropriate to do so at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No legislation is ever perfect. In recent years the legislation emanating from this government has been less than perfect. But that aside, the legislation before us now here today is long overdue by any judgment. It is important that we get a system in place, even if over time it is proven to be imperfect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be a great deal more emphasis on farm safety aspects of chemical use. I use this opportunity to applaud the work of the farm safe groups around New South Wales in highlighting the safe use of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have used many chemicals. I see Senator Panizza here, and I know that in Western Australia farmers use chemicals to make sure that they protect their land by not tilling it too hard with machines. There is a need for more research into the effects of chemicals, and encouragement given to less toxic alternatives. We need to consider all the other methods of control of weeds and insects, such as biological controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There needs to be serious consideration given to what realistically ought to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth, given that state boundaries are, with one exception, merely a geographical note on a map. Despite its shortcomings, I believe this legislation is a move in the right direction. I welcome the passage of it, and I support the remarks that Senator Tambling made earlier in this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak only for a brief time, but I want to raise a few points which I think are quite important, and some of which actually bear on legislation which, in some ways, parallels this legislation. As Senator Brownhill and others have already said, this package of bills marks a significant change in the way in which we register and regulate agricultural chemicals. It is certainly a move in the right direction in the sense that hitherto, while we have had an advisory system at the national level, the registration and regulation of these agents has been in the hands of the states, and there has been a variability between the states. That has been quite unsatisfactory, both with respect to the manufacturers, the marketers, the suppliers of these chemicals, and also the users. It was an unnecessarily cumbersome and rather expensive system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is certainly heartening to see that we are at last adopting a uniform system. But therein lies a very considerable danger. I think we will see an example of this when we deal with the Democrat amendments. The danger is that, rather than adopting a national system at the national level, what we have chosen to do is to go through a federalist-type system in which we need the cooperation and the agreement of the various states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What that has meant&mdash;and this is where I draw attention to other legislation of a similar type&mdash;and what it means in this case is that essentially it bypasses the democratic process because, as we will be told by the minister, it will be impossible for this chamber to amend this legislation. If we changed one comma or one full stop, such changes would also have to be adopted by the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same argument will be used if, say, Democrats in South Australia or New South Wales attempt to move any amendments to complimentary legislation that is put forward at state level. They will be told that this legislation cannot be touched because there is an agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw that just the other week with the offshore minerals legislation. Again, when an attempt was made by the Democrats to pass very desirable legislation to prevent mining in national parks, the argument was again used that we could not interfere with that legislation because it was a model which was being presented to us; it had come forward after long negotiation between the Commonwealth and the states, and it could not be touched. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I signal to other senators that this is a very dangerous road, because it means that nowhere in the open, accountable system are these types of bills properly being dealt with by the parliament. We are just being asked to rubber-stamp what essentially has been agreed between bureaucrats behind closed doors over some period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does it relate to federalism but also it relates to international agreements. Honourable senators will recall that on several occasions, when dealing with legislation which is designed to give effect to an international agreement that Australia has entered into, exactly the same thing has happened.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We have been told that we cannot interfere with this because this legislation is the result of an international agreement and we cannot change one comma or one full stop without in some way infringing the agreements that have been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I begin by raising that as a word of warning. We seem to be getting quite a bit of this type of legislation through at the present time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ever since the Second World War there has been a growing concern about the dangers associated with the use of agricultural chemicals. Many of us will recall that just before and during the war the chemical industry really got into its stride with the development of a whole range of chemicals which were thought to be extremely good at the time because they were very persistent chemicals and seemed to have very low human toxicity. Because of their persistence it was thought that many of our problems with agricultural pests would be solved once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early on there was no recognition of the twin problems: emerging resistance to those pesticides&mdash;there was often a concentration up food chains which resulted in predator animals at the top being far more affected by these pesticides than the pest which, by this time, had become resistant&mdash;and chemical persistence and long-term toxicity for humans, particularly genetic toxicity in relation to birth defects and cancer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rachel Carson, in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Silent Spring</EMPHASIS>&mdash;published, I think, in 1963&mdash;very dramatically drew attention to what had happened with the use of some of those organochlorine pesticides. Since then the list of agents which were formerly thought to be safe and which have since been discovered to have adverse side effects, either to the environment or to human health, has become longer and longer. It is that assumption of safety&mdash;more recently disabused by information about adverse effects&mdash;that sets the background against which we need to consider this type of legislation, the problems in relation to the continued use of these substances and also the development of alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention briefly the research which would lead to the development of biological controls, because Senator Brownhill mentioned that in his closing remarks. Over recent years, this government has required the CSIRO and other organisations to obtain a substantial portion of their funding for research from private sources. Thirty per cent is the proportion to which CSIRO is supposed to adhere. In the area of agricultural chemicals, the development of biological controls is inimical to the interests of the chemical companies and therefore is not likely to be funded by chemical companies. CSIRO and other organisations are being pressured to bend their research to those areas of research which will attract commercial funding. The very research which is likely to get us out of our bind with agricultural chemicals&mdash;to reduce our use of agricultural chemicals&mdash;is therefore likely to be done less and less in Australia, given the pressure under which research institutes are being put. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could mention, for instance, Senator Bell's home state of Tasmania where the department of agriculture has been working for some 15 years on biological control of a weed pest. That type of research is not going to attract commercial interest because, firstly, the time scale of the research is too long to be particularly profitable, and secondly, once the biological control is released it is no longer profitable to the company unless the organisation is able to build in some genetic control mechanism, which increasingly they are doing. That makes farmers and others subject in perpetuity to the control of the chemical companies and that, in itself, poses a very considerable danger. The direction this government has taken is therefore likely to further damage the research work which will lead to alternatives to chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to pick up a couple of other points, one being the question of having an expert on the board, which was mentioned by Senator Bell and Senator Brownhill. We have seen the argument used repeatedly&mdash;it has been used by the NRA and by others in this particular case&mdash;that if there is a requirement for a person with a particular expertise, say, in the impact of particular classes of chemicals on natural environments and the organisms in natural environments, they can be called in. That really begs the question: how will the board know when to call that expert opinion in if it does not have that expertise already among its members? Repeatedly, we have seen that committees constructed like this one have failed to bring in the expert advice they need, not because they are in any way perverse, but simply because they are ignorant of the information that may be available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The notion of having an expert on the environmental impact of agricultural chemicals on the board is an extremely good one. I do not think the argument of where do we stop, do we bring in a doctor, do we bring in this or that, is really to the point. The point is that these are chemicals which are being widely distributed into the environment. Repeatedly in the past we have seen adverse effects on a range of animals and plants in the environment&mdash;effects which are totally unexpected&mdash;often not showing up for some years afterwards. Because of that, this is the sort of expert who should really be on this board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am rather surprised by the concern over confidentiality. Most, if not all, of the agents used as agricultural chemicals in the commercial area are subject to patents. It seems to me that the possibility of anybody else manufacturing or selling any of these agents in competition with the larger suppliers is very remote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of openness of information lies in the fact that the public, including many of the doctors and others who would be asked to give advice to the public on the risks associated with agricultural chemicals, will have available to them predominantly the information which is provided by the chemical company. In the past we have seen numerous examples of chemical and drug companies filtering the information that goes to the public so that the good information&mdash;the advantages and benefits that flow from the use of the chemical&mdash;are given to the public, while the dangers&mdash;the risks and hazards associated with the use of the chemical&mdash;are not readily available or are put in very small type on the labels and are not generally accessible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, if, say, a farmer becomes concerned about a particular chemical which he or she is using, it is absolutely necessary that that person be able to get access to all the information on that particular agent. That person should be able to go to an independent expert and say, `Look, I am handling this particular material. What do you think?'. In particular, that person should be able to take it to somebody who has expressed concern about that chemical&mdash;somebody who is likely to give a view rather different from the view given by the chemical company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason, it is not good enough, as has been argued in some of the defences before us, that doctors and others can get access to that information only when a poisoning has occurred. It is important that everyone using chemicals has access to information when they are using or even thinking about using the chemicals and can go to an independent expert and get advice as to the risks associated with those chemicals. Again, I am very concerned about the aspect of commercial in-confidence as dealt with in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, one must remember that when one is dealing with these agricultural chemical companies, one is dealing with super giants. These are massive companies with billions of dollars of investment and financial, economic and legal power behind them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take pleasure in joining this debate on the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), in his second reading speech, said that it is an historic occasion. I do not put it at quite that order of importance, but I suppose it approaches something of that kind. This package of bills came out of the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, which was convened in 1990. That committee was constituted as a result of the pesticide in beef fiasco of the previous two years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pesticide in beef fiasco was a little overplayed by trade interests in places other than Australia. To a certain extent, pesticide in beef resulted from the availability of DDT at a very low price at the time. It was overused, especially in the potato growing areas. I believe some good came out of the pesticide in beef fiasco in the long run. It led to the Senate select committee inquiry, and it taught growers of beef to be a bit more careful about where they ran their cattle. I think all producers and consumers of beef have benefited from what happened at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 1 July 1991 the Commonwealth, states and territories agreed to a national registration scheme to replace the rather out of contact sort of situation where all the states and territories were operating in the field. On 1 July 1993 the Commonwealth took over evaluation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. Then, of course, in July 1993 the National Registration Authority was established, which obviously honourable senators know about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my knowledge, the use of chemicals has been the biggest advance in agriculture&mdash;I do not have to tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that I am very involved in agriculture&mdash;over the last 10 or 12 years. I would say that 1984 saw the beginning of the pre-emergent chemicals and also the high use of knockdown chemicals in crop growing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pre-1984 we had post-emergent chemicals only and there was very little availability of knockdown chemicals, so land was cultivated far more and that caused a lot of breakdown in soil structure and, of course, a great use of fuel. The more chemicals are used, the less fuel is used and the less cultivation occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the beginning of the rationalisation of costs. With the high increase in fuel prices, we had to look at ways of cutting those costs. With the knockdown method, people did not have to cultivate early to get rid of early weeds if there were early rains, and so forth. It was the real beginning of minimal cultivation, as already mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy bills under this national registration scheme aim at full cost recovery. You may remember, Mr Acting Deputy President, and from my knowledge, it was originally going to be spread over four years. We will now be in full cost recovery by 1995-96 with 80 per cent recovered by 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last year for which figures are fully available, Australian agriculture consumed $720 million worth of chemicals in the crop growing sphere and $200 million worth of veterinary chemicals. That accounts for over $1 billion, so we are not talking about small stakes. We can say that it boosts production of crops by about $4 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allied with minimal cultivation through chemical use is the fertiliser boost, which I believe will probably be the biggest advance in crop growing of the last two years. It will probably go through for the next three or four years because of the advent of more intensive soil testing with greater availability of different specialised fertilisers. Of course, that has come about through the fact that there is some competition for Australian fertilisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Manufacturers have come on board in the last few years and that has caused the monopoly of Australian superphosphate manufacturers to disappear somewhat. I am thinking of Summit Chemicals in Western Australia, for instance, which started importing these specialised fertilisers. Of course, the established manufacturers have had to reduce their prices. I believe the next advance in crop growing will be the more assiduous use of specialised fertilisers at a more opportune time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having chemicals available makes crop growing a lot easier. When a farmer enters a paddock to put in his crop he uses, say, a knockdown chemical or a pre-emergent, he does his cultivating and then his seeding. He then shuts up the paddock and, unless he has to apply a bit of post-emergent&mdash;hopefully, not too much&mdash;he does not come back until it is time to harvest the crop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Registration Authority claims to have a fast-track method of evaluating and registering new chemicals in Australia. That is very important. Knockdown and pre-emergent chemicals such as gleen, which first came on the scene in 1984, have been used to control rye grass and wild oats. We are now starting to see a resistance to those chemicals. Of course, we have had a build-up of rye grass toxicity in sheep. Introducing new chemicals must not be a slow process, otherwise we have to go right back and do a lot more cultivation, which will increase costs and reduce production. The fast-track method to get these new chemicals on the shelf is very much welcomed by Australian grain growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have to make sure that there is competition. I remember when gleen came along in 1984 or thereabouts. We trialled it in 1982 on a small area. But when this chemical was mass produced in 1984, it had no competition whatsoever. It did not have competition until the arrival of logran, which is somewhat of a generic sort of brand. It is very significant to note that the current price of gleen is almost exactly the same as it was in 1988. That is about the time that its competitor, logran, came onto the market. If we have new products, it is very important to have them evaluated quickly and registered so that we do not have one product sitting on its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same can be said about the knockdown chemical Roundup, which was probably the second most effective chemical of this type to come along. Sprayseed was the first one, but it was very difficult and dangerous to handle. We had to use proper methods, otherwise we could have finished up with more than a great headache. When roundup came along, the competition between it and sprayseed caused the price to stay rather static. Of course, roundup itself now has a competitor in the generic glyphosphate. As I say, quick evaluation and registration of chemicals is very important if we are to have competition and ensure that farmers are not paying through the nose for chemicals. After all, chemicals are a very big item. I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment the cost of chemicals used by grain growers is getting somewhat towards the higher end of the scale. In the past, when there was minimal chemical use, fertilisers normally used to be the highest cost item of wheat growing, followed by fuel. Now in some cases the cost of chemicals is passing the cost of fertilisers and, certainly, it has gone past the cost of fuel. As I said before, if one uses more chemicals, less fuel is used. The cost of chemicals is a very big factor. An inquiry some time in the future into the cost of chemicals in Australia would not be out of order but, of course, that is not the topic of debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Competition, as I have already said, tends to hold prices  in check. In fact, I heard only last evening from a person who rang me that, because of the good competition that gleen has been getting from logran over the past two or three years, gleen's manufacturers have added an incentive. The manufacturers have said that if a crop sprayed with gleen is not harvested because of drought, or frost, or come what may, they will replace the chemical to put on the crop next year. I have not read the fine print, but this is something that has come out of the blue because of competition. I am hoping that logran will reciprocate next week. Fast-tracking is very important to create plenty of competition on the shelf and to keep cost down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chemicals are part and parcel of agriculture. I know that in the past our friends the Democrats and the Greens have advocated an alternative way of farming which will do away with fertilisers and chemicals altogether. Agriculture is very competitive these days. Farmers have to realise that farming without chemicals and without fertilisers is a good way to ensure that they go into liquidation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said earlier that the administration of the National Registration Authority is based on full cost recovery. But I believe safeguards should be built in to prevent this authority becoming another AQIS. We all know from debate in this chamber how AQIS has been operating. It has virtually been unaccountable to the parliament, to the users of its services, and to anyone else. It is probably not even accountable to itself. It has mushroomed and ballooned into an authority that does not really know where it is going and is adding to the cost of meat producers in Australia. I certainly hope that governments attempt to keep a lid on the costs and to make the National Registration Authority accountable and transparent. We have to make sure that it does not go the way of AQIS and a few other government bodies, semi-government bodies and statutory bodies, as this one is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Registration Authority may consider that it is passing the cost back to the users of the scheme&mdash;that is, the manufacturers of chemicals. But I can assure the Senate from past experience&mdash;and I am sure other people have had similar experiences&mdash;that all of this is passed back to the end user. The end user, in this case, is the farmer, and he will be made to pay right down to the last cent. However, with proper monitoring, I believe that this can be controlled. Unfortunately, I cannot see that there is anything whatsoever in this legislation that will ensure that there is transparency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I welcome the legislation that has resulted from a Senate select committee inquiry. I enjoyed very much my time on that committee with my colleagues. Probably this legislation is not the real answer to what we were, and still are, looking for. But I am sure that, with a couple of years of experience down the track, we will be able to look at the legislation again to make sure that it is doing the job that it is intended to do to the advantage not only of farmers but everyone else who uses chemicals and veterinary products. I do not use anywhere near as much veterinary products as I do agricultural chemicals. But all users of chemicals and veterinary products will benefit in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bell and Senator Coulter have already raised many concerns regarding this package of legislation. Senator Panizza, Senator Brownhill and Senator Tambling from the opposition have received the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill and cognate bills well. When a new system is being considered which is an advance over previous arrangements, it is difficult to know how to relate to the concerns and problems that may be present in it. Certainly the second reading speeches, the parts of the bills and explanatory memoranda sound good. That could be taken as an encouragement that the legislation has been set up in such a way as to look at the agricultural and veterinary chemicals management within our country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a package of seven bills which are being considered together. I will illustrate one thing which looks good in the second reading speech on one of these bills. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislative package extends the functions of the National Registration Authority for agricultural and veterinary chemicals . . . to include the registration and control of . . . products. The new functions have been developed in consultation with the states and territories to ensure a consistent approach to the assessment and control of chemical products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Furthermore, the NRA is to have regard to the government's policy in relation to the principles of ecologically sustainable development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also the NRA will be required to comply with the policies of Commonwealth, state and territory governments that are determined under an agreement to be entered into between those governments for the purpose of this proposed Act and the AGVET codes.</PARA>
<PARA>Who could disagree with the rhetoric there or at least the lip-service? Unfortunately, underneath that there are concerns that need to be addressed; and I will be referring to them later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention a matter in passing but I will not touch on it in any great detail. It concerns the bill in this package which relates to the collection of a levy which covers cost recovery. There is a four-year period phase-in of the way the National Registration Authority will be able to manage the cost recovery associated with the bill. That does sound impressive. The bill that is within this package identifies how liability for payment of a levy charge will be determined and the amount that will be imposed. Generally speaking, liability for the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of chemical products in Australia. Cost recovery and the implication that it concerns the sale or disposal of chemical products do not and should not convey any moral permission or control that allows these chemicals to be so regarded as not to take in community concerns and the manufacturing standards being set up by the NRA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Greens (WA) approve the development of principles, guidelines and standards which are supported by legislation, there is considerable concern that the present legislation does not go nearly far enough in the direction of community right to know and ecologically sustainable development processes. Senator Coulter has already pointed out that because the legislation is being established by a federal rather than a national process&mdash;state agreements make up the legislation&mdash;Commonwealth-state agreements can be used to tie the hands of any state that wishes to be progressive. So on the one hand it may well pull up those who may bring the standards down but, on the other hand, it may well impede developments that can be very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned that the mechanisms by which this legislation is established should be able to be improved quite dramatically on those currently represented here. I have already mentioned the positives. I have said it sounds good&mdash;but is it? I want to indicate that there are positives&mdash;and there are community groups. As we have already heard from my colleagues in this place, many sections of the community welcome such legislation and the development it represents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also people who really welcome the initiatives that the chemical industry has taken to look at its sometimes very doubtful heritage in our world. I would like to quote from some conference notes by Mr Tom Reynolds of the Puritan Churchill Chemical Company. He presented a key speech to Parliamentarians for Global Action, talking about the development of the chemical weapons convention. His speech highlights the importance of the chemical industry worldwide. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From its earliest days, the chemical industry has had a global impact, both with respect to its products and its technology, both of which flowed easily around the world. This remains true today, the chemical industry is truly global, and seeks to ensure that its products and technology still flow easily around the world.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to point out that eight of the 10 top chemical companies are European. He also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The chemical industry now recognises that it must accept social responsibility for its actions and take into account the effects of these actions on people and the planet. The Australian Chemical Industry Council in concert with the chemical industry in many parts of the world has developed and adopted a "Responsible Care" initiative to enshrine this concern in its day to day operations. This view was certainly not always held by the industry or the community in the early days, however, all our attitudes have changed towards conservation and the environment in the last 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA>The input of Mr Tom Reynolds was extremely positive, as is the initiative that he referred to in that speech. I want to acknowledge that, as I go on to look at some of the negatives in relation to this legislation and to the community feedback that the Greens have received. One comment is from the Toxin Action Group. It notes in a press release in February this year that it believes double standards rob rural workers' rights. It points out that community and rural groups are incensed over the federal government's decision to provide them less protection and less access to information than have industrial workers in the new agricultural and veterinary chemical bills 1993. The release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"There is absolutely no excuse for the Federal Government in this new legislation to give rural workers and their communities less rights and protection than their counterparts in industry. We are shocked that the new Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Bill has not adopted the Worksafe standard for access to information on chemicals." spokesperson for TAG, Ms Grinter said.</PARA>
<PARA>She talks about how the preparation of the new bill regulates the registration of new chemicals and reviews old and outdated chemicals. She believes that the continuation of secrecy clauses and companies' rights to refuse information is to the detriment of community groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also talks about approaches that have been made to board members of the National Registration Authority. The people were assured that their concerns would be addressed, yet the final draft of the legislation does not reflect the concerns that have been raised. This group has also raised a concern, which I think was mentioned earlier, that there was a very limited consultation process. They were concerned that it was mere tokenism and did not really support the words that have led people to hope that the National Registration Authority was a new broom that would sweep through the outdated agricultural and veterinary chemicals section of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, to be replaced with a more open and transparent method of consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go on to some of the detailed concerns expressed by community groups. I will refer back to that concern about protection for industrial workers by the worksafe provision and the fact that rural communities are being denied the right to access product content details. I will go further into the detail of these concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention some issues of concern that have been raised in relation to these bills. First, there is a failure to have represented in the structure of the board of the National Registration Authority representatives of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, public health agencies and conservationists. A second issue of concern is the extremely important and integral issue of commercial-in-confidence data which has not been addressed to the satisfaction of some of the community groups. The community is still denied the right to access product content formulation details. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of parents within the organisations have expressed some of these concerns. For reasons of children's health they require immediate access to data on product ingredients, particularly in relation to solvent and surfactant content. Obviously this has a major community impact in relation to children's health and allergic reactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also consider it an essential role for the NRA to assess company claims for commercial-in-confidence data, particularly in the light of the introduction of proprietary rights in Australia. The NRA should be responsible for the development of procedures for easy access to such information by the community. This concern was also supported by peak environment groups which were involved in briefing sessions with the NRA. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strong views have been expressed that the NRA should accept a similar policy to the current Worksafe national policy statement on the commercial confidentiality of data relating to workplace substances. There appears to be no justification for agricultural workers and associated rural communities being afforded less access to data and occupational health protection than other segments of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point of concern is the absence of appeal rights for the community in response to decisions made by the NRA. The requirement to prove standing for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would severely limit any access to this body, particularly with the sometimes limited availability of community groups to legal expertise and, occasionally, to the legal aid that may be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of public participation generally within the act is of concern, as the NRA appears to have the discretionary powers to either permit public involvement or not. Public participation should be ensured as a right throughout the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A different group, the North Coast Environment Council, considered that the concept of both precautionary principle or pesticide reduction must be addressed in the proposed act. Senator Bell's amendment would address that omission. The Greens intend to support the Australian Democrat amendments and are very disappointed with the lack of support that has apparently been expressed on the part of the government to look at those amendments and incorporate them in this legislation. </PARA>

If the minister is prepared to incorporate some of those principles, we would be happy to oblige with an adjournment to allow that time. Along with the environment groups that have expressed concerns, the Greens consider that the precautionary principle and the principle of pesticide reduction should underlie the aims and actions of the NRA, and that statements to this effect should be included in amendments to its functions and powers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A final concern&mdash;I shall raise some others later&mdash;is that the North Coast Environment Council considers the lack of outlined monitoring procedures for chemicals once they have been registered will result in a system that has no quality control and no ongoing audit process. While this aspect of the bill may be a state responsibility, monitoring procedures should be formally described within the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This relates to Senator Coulter's concern that, once this legislation is in place, because it has this federal aspect it may not allow states to take the due monitoring courses they should take. So there is a suggestion here that that kind of monitoring procedure could be set up and provided for in the legislation to assist states to recognise its vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some questions which I will possibly put during the committee stage of this bill. But I want to finish on a positive note. I have a message from Householders for Safe Pesticide Use that in general it supports the NRA report and recommendations but would have preferred an immediate ban on organochlorines. The restrictions on imports beginning in April 1994, with the complete cessation of imports in September 1994, are likely to result in a relatively early end to the use of these chemicals across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That organisation wants to make sure that that recommendation is followed. It notes that the ACT has already imposed a complete ban on organochlorines and that Western Australia, where alternatives are better established than in any other state, is unaccountably dragging its feet. The Northern Territory appears to be the main stumbling block to the Australia-wide ban, and that is also noted in relation to setting up this particular legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only hope that the commitment that Simon Crean made when he was the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy to banning these persistent and hazardous chemicals will be continued through the NRA's emphasis and under the new minister for that portfolio, Senator Collins. It is very clear that the continued use of organochlorines, even if only for termite control, is likely to pose a threat to the `clean green' image federal and state authorities are promoting for Australian produce and the environment in which it is grown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that the Greens have an ambivalent attitude towards this legislation. We know that it has the support of the Senate. We wish to signify our concern that this bill does not go far enough in the direction we feel is certainly called for at present. We had hoped it would lead us in an even more progressive direction than that in which we are currently going. So we await the responses to the amendments that have been proposed by the Democrats and the result of the committee stage before we decide whether to support the bill. At the moment it seems to us that there are some very notable omissions that do not give us the kind of reassurance we would like to have&mdash;namely, that the words of the legislation are matched by political will.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In concluding this debate on the second reading of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Bill and cognate bills, I will respond to some of  the comments expressed by Senator Chamarette. I am somewhat concerned at the Greens' attitude of ambivalence towards this legislation. It is a poor approach by the Greens because this is a significant piece of legislation. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette may not be aware of the background and the consultations that have taken place. I want to rebut criticism that consultation has not been as extensive as it should have been. This process commenced with a Senate select committee in 1988. And here we are, five years later, following very extensive consultation by the Senate committee, by the government and consultations between the federal government and the states and all interested parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Chamarette defines `consultation' as taking the attitude `Well, you didn't agree with me, therefore you did not consult', then she is right. But certainly there has been consultation over a period of five years and, given the importance of this legislation, it was critical that consultation should have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an unusual debate in that four senators who have spoken in this debate, as I understand it, were involved in the committee in 1988 which reported on agricultural and veterinary chemicals. They include Senator Coulter, Senator Brownhill and Senator Panizza. That committee was certainly before my time in this place, and it was certainly before Senator Chamarette's time, but I think we should place that on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the content of the proposed legislation reflects the recommendations made by that Senate committee. In fact, 12 of its recommendations are covered by provisions of the bills before the Senate. It is a good example of the effective work that most Senate committees do. I do not say all because I have some criticisms on some aspects of the Senate committee system, but that is a matter which should be considered at another time. Nevertheless, this reflects the very important and critical role that Senate committees can play in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank all honourable senators who have indicated their support. Senator Bell has some amendments but, at the end of the day, I think he would concede that this is progress. The legislation may not go as far as he would like to take it. I recognise the more responsible attitude he has taken. I do not think Senator Bell would describe his attitude in the same way as the Greens described theirs&mdash;ambivalent. Senator Bell has conceded that this legislation represents significant progress, if not the progress that the Democrats are looking for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of these bills will bring very significant changes to the regulation of agricultural and veterinary chemicals in Australia. The provisions are aimed at improving efficiency. Such provisions include statutory deadlines for the processing of applications and penalties should those deadlines not be met. The system will become much more open and transparent with the provision of public release summaries and a facility for the public to nominate chemicals for inclusion in the review of existing chemical programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national registration scheme also represents another milestone in the government's program of micro-economic reform. It is producing benefits for agriculture and the chemical industry, contributing to the increased competitiveness of Australian industries and improving the safeguards placed on these chemicals for all Australians. The scheme also includes new provisions not possible under the previous two-tiered clearance system. It includes: controls on the import, export and manufacture of agvet chemicals; compensation provisions for certain data which will underpin the review of the existing chemicals program; a national focus on the issue; and improved information flows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme will place Australia among the few nations of the world with a formal minor use program to address the difficult issues of chemical use in minor crops. These achievements are the result of concerted effort from all concerned, with a high level of consultation with stakeholders and cooperation from many interested groups. Those groups include rural sector groups, consumers, the chemical industry and, in particular, the states and territories. This will provide Australia with a word-class registration system which will ensure that the health and environment aspects of agvet chemicals are maintained and that our rural exports are protected.

<PARA>The Senate has just failed to recognise the need to agree with the second reading amendment calling for funding provision to be made available for the National Registration Authority to meet its community service obligations. However, another amendment which could be made to the bill would enable the public process to be more transparent. It would not be just a matter of looking at government gazettes, but also that the NRA would be required to publish in daily newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRA has already taken upon itself to publish in capital city daily newspapers some of its undertakings in terms of registration of chemicals. This is what we really need to consider. While it is possible for the NRA to do that at the moment, it is not required for it to do so in that way. Thankfully, at the moment, the administration sees fit to use the national daily newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have one example in front of me from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hobart Mercury</EMPHASIS> of 23 February 1994 where there was a notice that metosulam was to be considered for registration. There was an application in front of the NRA. In the advertisement which was placed in that newspaper, the NRA invited public submissions on matters relevant to the application. The advertisement stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons/organisations interested in preparing a submission can obtain a summary of the NRA evaluation report by phoning . . .</PARA>
<PARA>At that point, a Canberra phone number was given. I phoned that number last Wednesday and asked for a copy of that summary. I have yet to receive it. Tomorrow that will be a week away. The response is required by 22 March, three weeks hence. I would suggest that already we have embarked upon the process of monitoring the performance of this organisation, and already it has been demonstrated that the public process leaves a little to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether it is the fault of the Senate mailing system that the material has not reached me yet, but one week out of four leaves little time to respond. This is the very sort of thing we have to be careful of. That is the reason for these amendments to the bill at the moment. Wherever possible, public involvement needs to be as wide and immediate as possible. I suggest, even if we do get the notices into the major newspapers circulating in each capital city, we still have to monitor the performance of the NRA in facilitating public involvement in its processes. That is the reason for moving the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will soon detect that the formidable looking page of amendments to this Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill contains many consequential amendments to achieve virtually the same thing, except Nos 5 and 6. At the moment, the clause referred to limits application for variations of approvals or registration to interested persons, that is, the original applicant who applied for the approval. We believe any person should be able to apply for variations to approvals or a registration. That is an argument which was well rehearsed in my earlier contribution and I do not think it needs to be repeated. That is the purpose of the amendments proposed to the bill. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in a major newspaper circulating in each capital city.</PARA>
<PARA>I have to say that this is, frankly, wacky Democratic approach at its worst or best, depending on our approach. The cost of this would be phenomenal. I am informed that doing it once will cost $8,000 to $10,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed it is already done 30 times, so it is already costing some tens of thousands of dollars. The Democrats' proposal will see us doing it hundreds of times at a cost of $8,000 to $10,000 per time. I am not sure whether Senator Bell is aware of that. It means that millions of dollars would be spent on newspaper advertisements. Although I am laughing and smiling at the thought, I regard it as a serious matter when an unnecessary proposal is put up that will cost astronomical amounts of money. The legislation provides that a mailing list will be kept of all of the main interest groups. A relevant interest group on agricultural and chemical matters that notifies us will be directly mailed. This is a much more cost effective way of dealing with the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normally it would be desirable to advertise as much as possible, but the phenomenal cost of the Democrat approach&mdash;involving literally millions of dollars&mdash;is not a cost effective way of notifying the public and these various interest groups. Sadly, I have to rebuke Senator Bell and the Democrats for putting forward one of the whackiest amendments that we have had in the Senate this year, involving as it does a ridiculous amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will touch briefly on matters raised in these amendments and in the debate at large. The issue of funds being made available for the National Registration Authority to enable it to perform community service obligations essential to the evaluation and control of agricultural and veterinary chemical products is a paraphrase of another amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In agreeing to establish the national registration scheme, the government also agreed that the scheme should be funded 100 per cent by industry. Again I have to rebuke the Democrats. I would have thought that where commercial benefit is gained by companies in selling chemicals, the cost of its regulation for the public good should be met by the industry itself and not out of general taxpayers' funds. The government is a strong advocate of that. I am surprised the Democrats are suggesting that taxpayers should be subsidising commercial operations out of government funds. That is the effect of what the Democrats are asking for. Clearly that suggestion is not acceptable to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the opening statement we gave a commitment that there will be a review of the legislation after 18 or 20 months. This will include an assessment of cost recovery, including community service obligations. These assessments are best made when some operational time has elapsed to evaluate what community service obligation there is, if any, and whether there should be a government contribution. I am certainly aware that there are other instances of charging policy on the part of government&mdash;for example, in AQIS. I do not want to develop that debate beyond saying that it is an existing government operation that is phasing in a charge and that the community obligation is regularly assessed. That is also done with the Fisheries Management Authority. We are best able to assess the community obligations, if they exist, when we have had some operational experience. For those reasons, we cannot accept the amendments as proposed by the Democrats and, I understand, by the Greens. </PARA>

<PARA>There is no need for me to rehearse the particulars of each of the amendments but I shall speak to them in general. The purpose of the amendments was rehearsed in my contribution on the second reading. Briefly, the purpose of our first amendment to clause 6 of the bill seeks to deliver to the package a convenient place for public contribution to provide feedback on the use aspect of chemicals. It brings into operation the precautionary principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill glibly speaks of the precautionary principle or the principle of ecologically sustainable development, but acceptance of this amendment will deliver the implementation of that principle. We should monitor how the chemicals are used in real life&mdash;certainly not the TV program. The `public'&mdash;the group of people who are using these chemicals&mdash;should have a capacity to provide the information on the effects of that usage. At the moment the process is the other way around. Instead of providing a facility which is easily accessible and also registered and calculated by legislation, it is almost a case of avoiding the opportunity for the public to contribute. That is the purpose of amendment No. 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments 2, 3 and 4 insert a specific reference to the precautionary principle into the definition in this bill, and I think it reads reasonably well. It is a definition which I lifted from the government's draft national strategy for ecologically sustainable development prepared in June 1992 by the ecologically sustainable development steering committee. The definition provides an illumination which is not displayed in the bills. The committee heard evidence as to why that was the case. Too many presumptions are made and too many `glib' agreements entered into without their spelling out what is required. Certainly the guiding principles would be much clearer if this amendment were accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could spend the time of the committee further developing these reasons but both the coalition and the government have made it clear that they are not prepared to accept any amendments. I reinforce Senator Coulter's contention and plead for honourable senators to be very wary of the fundamental shortcoming of this approach to legislation. We have been placed in a situation where amendment is difficult; it is discouraged. I will not say that we have been intimidated to the extent that we are afraid to move amendments, but we have been strongly discouraged from moving amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling did not appear to be cowed by the threat of it having to go back to the states and territories. However, in both the government's and the coalition's contribution there was the concern that so much had been invested&mdash;a mass of time and negotiation&mdash;that, to use the words of the chairman of the NRA in evidence before the committee, upsetting the applecart was something to be avoided. Senator Coulter is right to draw the attention of the committee to our tendency to deliberate upon legislation which has already been assembled and intertwined and has the collective weight of state approval behind it. I would hope that the reluctance of the government and the coalition to accept these amendments is based on content and not on that fear. Neither the government nor the coalition look that afraid to me but it is a thing that we should be considering. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know Senator Sherry gave a reason for not accepting the previous amendment. I will just take a second to address that because I think he got it wrong, actually. I accept that there is a vast cost involved in telling people what the government is doing by putting notices in the newspaper. That seems a reasonable defence against accepting our worthwhile attempt to tell people what was going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His other defence was that the taxpayer should not have to fund commercial operations. That is not what was being asked at all. It was a question of who is the user of this whole legislation. The user that is being asked to pay is not only the producer, not only the farmer and not only the consumer of the chemicals. The user is the whole community because the whole community is safeguarded by this legislation. The whole community derives benefit from knowing that our food is safe and that our farm practices are safe. The user is the whole community, which derives benefit from knowing that Australia can actually match the rhetoric of Minister Crean by being clean and green. Therefore, the whole community, in deriving benefit, should contribute to this National Registration Authority scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, I have a private member's bill which implements coalition policy that such schemes only be funded by the contributor to 50 per cent. I intend to revitalise that private member's bill at a suitable occasion to see whether the coalition can welcome its own policy&mdash;the policy that I read before the last election. I do not know what the policy is now, but it seemed to be a good policy at that time. I could not resist tackling the assertion that the parliamentary secretary made to me. I will not talk any more about these amendments. I think I have made it clear what their purpose is, and I know what the numbers are for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly the numbers are clear&mdash;you are going to lose on this occasion and on other occasions you will win. Some you lose, some you win. The weight of argument, as well as the numbers, is overwhelmingly against the Democrats on this occasion. There are sound arguments for not accepting the amendments, given that there has been a five-year process of consultation, given that the principles embodied in the legislation emerged from a Senate committee, and given that the federal government does not have sole constitutional power in this area. States are a reality; they have constitutional rights. We can disagree at times about that but the facts are the facts&mdash;states have rights in this area. They needed to be consulted and a consensus needed to be developed. I do not think that holding that up as an important element in securing the passage of this legislation is in any way a threat, intimidation or anything like that; it is just a fact of life that we have to deal with in Australia as best we can.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the amendment that seeks to provide a facility by which the public may submit information, Senator Bell may or may not be aware that the reason we will not accept this is that it is unnecessary. At its most recent meeting, the board of the NRA decided to establish, in cooperation with New Zealand, a suspected adverse chemical reaction register. As I am advised, this will be established in the next six months. The procedures and format have been agreed with New Zealand and will be implemented. In addition, health data is already being collected by the National Injury Surveillance Unit of the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and Worksafe Australia's farmsafe program&mdash;a national strategy aimed at improving occupational health and safety on farms. Again, I am advised that any person from the public can submit concerns they have about chemicals to these organisations. We do not believe that the amendment as proposed is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major comments made by Senator Bell went to the precautionary principle and inserting a new subsection. We believe that that amendment is unnecessary. As I noted in the introductory statement, the NRA is required in the performance of its functions to have regard for the Commonwealth government's policy on ecologically sustainable development. That policy includes seven guiding principles, one of which is the precautionary principle. Therefore, it is taken into account in that form in this legislation. It is important that equal weight be accorded to all those principles, not just to one of them. Certainly ecologically sustainable development is a very important principle but the other principles are important as well. It is important that they are all accorded equal weight in that particular policy, as it is expressed and reflected by this legislation, and that one is not amplified over the other. For those reasons, we are opposing the amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) has just said, there has been no collusion or collaboration between the coalition and the government but there certainly has been an agreement between us on this occasion as to our stance on the Democrat amendment. That is simply because common sense should prevail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed by the Democrats are very much the sorts of amendments we have come to expect on these sorts of issues that come up from time to time because of the specific agendas and policies of the Democrats. Unfortunately, as usual, the Democrats do not recognise the constitutional constraints that apply, and that in this instance responsibility rests with the states. Now that an agreement has been reached, after 25 years, it would be a real pity to jeopardise those arrangements and that timing. Whilst the Democrats may from time to time attempt to write a new environmental testament, I do not see why on this occasion we should accept the gospel of either John or Robert. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to speak briefly on this and recount my experience, particularly in view of what Senator Tambling has just said. Some honourable senators might know that until 1980 I worked as a research scientist in the area of occupational health. I would like to recount just one episode of many I had which dealt with a government department in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The engineering and water supply department was responsible for the installation and management of the water supply and sewerage in Adelaide and also in country areas in South Australia. This particular department used very large pipes in one of its installations for the carriage of water and sewage. To protect these pipes against rusting it virtually bandaged them in a mixture of pitch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The workers became aware that pitch was one of those things that had been identified as a human carcinogen&mdash;a substance capable of causing cancer. They contacted the Health Commission in South Australia and asked whether some work could be done to estimate the risks to which they were exposed. The Health Commission had no facilities at that stage to carry out the sorts of tests that were necessary and, through the nursing sister who worked at this E&amp;WS establishment, I was asked whether I could carry out some tests to estimate the actual risks to the men who were doing this work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The men were involved in heating the pitch to a high temperature, leaning over the 44-gallon or 200-litre drum of melted pitch, bucketing it out, layering it up on these very large pipes, and then turning the bandages around the pipes to hold the pitch onto them. It was possible, with the laboratory facilities that I then had, to estimate the amount of cancer-causing agent in the pitch before and after it was heated. It worked out that in one 44-gallon drum of pitch there was the release of the equivalent of four million cigarettes, and these men were working in a relatively confined space, leaning over this drum, and being exposed to this material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for telling this story is that when my report went to the department, that practice was stopped immediately and the workmen there were no longer exposed to this cancer-causing risk. However, the engineering and water supply department then contracted this work out to private people, who carried on the same activity. The workers there were not told&mdash;and this is the point I am making&mdash;of the risks involved or of the work that had been done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, when the Health Commission, another government department in South Australia, undertook to do some of this work, it chose not to come to me for an estimate of the risks to those workers and also to provide the information&mdash;quite contrary to the rules&mdash;to the employer but not to the union concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So with that as background I would simply point out that there is very much a need for people to know, and that this ability for members of the public to submit information lies at the heart of the proper protection of the public. From my personal experience I must say that one cannot rely on those organisations, even those run by state governments and charged with the responsibility of looking after the public health, to carry out that obligation. I have had that experience with at least two government departments in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I would make a strong plea to Senator Tambling to review what he has said in the light of what I have just recounted. We are not putting up these amendments out of some airy fairy notion that they might be a good thing; they come out of actual experience with chemicals by somebody who has worked over some years in the field of occupational health. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my experience in relation to these matters, in my reading, in the discussions of the committee, and also in consideration of the evidence in the submissions that were given, I have found that the people who have been responsible for overseeing the management of chemicals in Australia have done less than a wonderful job. There has been a fair bit of baggage carried over time by these people, and a lot of mistrust has developed. That is a concern of the Democrats and the Greens. I was very much impressed by the chairman in his attitude to these matters, and his determination to see that questions of labelling and use&mdash;in so far as the NRA would be able to assert its authority&mdash;would be properly carried out. Obviously the government's attitude and that of the opposition is that these people on the NRA should be given the opportunity to do just that and that the provision within this group of bills will arm them to do so. If they do not do that in a short period&mdash;18 months&mdash;we will have a look at the way in which the legislation is operating and we will make whatever adjustments need to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>

One has only to look at the fact that we used DDT in this country some years after it was banned all around the world to have some appreciation of the arguments being advanced by the Greens and the Democrats. However I, like the minister, believe that we should pass the legislation in its current form, give it an opportunity to operate, and give the authority the opportunity to show us that it will do the job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill before the Senate is the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. On behalf of the opposition, I indicate that the Liberal and National parties will not oppose this bill at the second reading. It has a number of positive innovations adding flexibility&mdash;making, as some have claimed, this odious measure a little more business friendly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition still wants to abolish the whole levy arrangement because of its remaining inflexibilities, the burden it places upon business and the distortion of some areas of training. I will refer in my speech to a wide range of expert and business opinion&mdash;indeed, even trade union opinion&mdash;that this whole measure be suspended. In the committee stage I will move on behalf of the opposition three groups of amendments, and which I will outline these three groups of amendments in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has no financial impact. There is no additional cost to government or to the taxpayer as a result of it. To a large extent, the bill in some measure fulfils the promise given by the government to business during the last election campaign. The government understood that this training levy was odious and was seen to be counterproductive by many areas of the Australian economy and, accordingly, some hints at making the burden lighter were indicated by the Labor Party during the election campaign. Some of these promises have been translated to the legislation that is now before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the flexibilities added to this basically flawed bill provide for an allowance to average training expenditure by any business over a two-year period rather than that business having to spend the money within the financial year under review as defined. It will allow any unspent money to be picked up in the following year. In due course, I will move an amendment that seeks to extend that averaging of two years levy over two years to three years levy over three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment in the bill will allow a range of businesses to be grouped, as defined in the bill, so that their spending for training levy purposes can be averaged across the whole group and not precisely one business by one business. That is a welcome innovation and adds some flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Change to the definitions regarding  equipment will allow an extended range of equipment used by businesses for training purposes to be eligible under the provisions of the act. They will include the use of equipment that is on lease or hire&mdash;flexibility that has been sought for some years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act that is to be amended is about four years old. It started on 1 July 1990. In due course in the committee stage, on behalf of the Liberal and National parties, I will seek to move an amendment providing for cessation of the whole bill on 1 July 1994, which means that business in this country has had to suffer a four-year penalty upon business.. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties&mdash;indeed, I am sure all honourable senators&mdash;wish to see appropriate investment in training by business throughout Australia. Rather than having counterproductive measures such as this one that has been in existence for nearly four years, we would rather see more general incentives offered to business. The best incentive of all is that the only way to be internationally competitive, the only way to have a medium and long-term future and prosperity in any business, is for proper investments to be made in the most important asset of any business. I refer to the skill of its own management and employees. We believe this outcome will be better achieved by not having an overregulated, distorting burden upon business, such as this requirement for a levy on any business that does not meet the training guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also bring to an end discrimination against people aged over 21 being trained in a business, and we welcome that move. We welcome all the measures in the bill, but they do not go anywhere near far enough to satisfy the Liberal and National parties. They make a bad act slightly less bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third opposition amendment to the bill will allow more extensive grouping of businesses that are legitimate under company law. In the committee stage I will deal in more detail with the three amendments&mdash;namely, the extension to a three-year averaging; the extension of grouping to be more sensible, more flexible; and a group of amendments that would terminate the whole legislation on 1 July this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the penalties that this act brings to business is the cost of record keeping, which process takes a lot of time and a lot of money. That record keeping does not add a jot to the training of personnel within a company or to their skills. Sometimes Labor governments kid themselves&mdash;they do not kid the Australian people&mdash;that just because certain monitoring goes on, there is substance in the outcome of what is being monitored. It is more often the case that by chewing up time and money the process of record keeping leads to a counterproductive diversion of precious resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quantity is also no guarantee of quality. Even government senators opposite, such as Senator Carr, no doubt would aspire to the achievement of quality rather than just quantity in the training given to personnel in every business. There is a problem when legislation seeks to define, measure and gain quality outcomes. We need quality outcomes and well trained personnel in businesses, but certainly we do not need intervening, overregulating, counterproductive measures such as this legislation represents&mdash;and, I fear, will continue to represent even with these positive improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The views that I have put are not those of only the Liberal and National parties. I want to cite seven major authorities in Australia who are currently critical of this whole act and who want to see it ended. The first authority is Mr Kelty, the most important figure in the trade union movement. He led a task force on regional development. On page 32 of the task force report, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regional employers said the TGL had created an administrative burden and was failing to provide the training for which it was designed.</PARA>
<PARA>This is Mr Kelty. This is the government's own task force on regional development. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force was told that while many employers were committed to providing training for all employees, other employers were distorting the intent of the program by spending training money on, for example, executive "training weekends" in luxury resorts. The Task Force believes that a new system is needed to direct training money into where it is most needed&mdash;the traineeship system. Given the problems with the TGL and the fact that it has not provided training for the group which really needs it, the Task Force believes it should be suspended.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Kelty thinks. He supports the amendments that I will be moving&mdash;that we suspend the training guarantee levy. Maybe any hesitancy amongst government senators to support my amendments and to see an end to this whole legislation by July will be because they have it in mind to do the same thing in the May budget. Will the Treasurer (Mr Willis) actually abolish the training guarantee levy in the May budget this year? To be safe, let us accept the amendments that I will be moving so that we see the end of this legislation on 1 July of this year at the latest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second authority is the Industries Commission. It is another very important advisory body to the government and to all Australians. In its 1992-93 annual report, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet the efficacy and efficiency of a compulsory levy can be questioned. One recent study concluded that the levy is a blunt instrument for achieving its objectives and has recommended a move away from compulsion and penalties . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The third authority is the evidence that has arisen from surveys of businesses about the ineffectiveness of the training guarantee levy. A study by Professor Charles Noble of Charles Sturt University on businesses in the Albury-Wodonga area found that 81 per cent of firms surveyed said that if the levy was abolished there would be no reduction. There would be no reduction if the levy was abolished. In his evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on this bill, Professor Noble said that he thought it better to look at training alternatives other than the training guarantee levy. Professor Noble's submission to the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The training Guarantee played an important role in emphasising the benefits of training, especially for firms that have under-invested in human resources development. It is doubtful if this approach is the most appropriate way of encouraging training in the longer term. Even with the amendments now being considered it is likely that some training expenditure will be wasted.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an expert on the matter. This is evidence that has  led these concerns to be taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Professor Noble goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rather than persisting with a review of the TG, it should be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA>It should be abolished. That is the sentiment expressed not only by Mr Kelty, but also by Professor Noble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth authority is Professor Jim Gaite and Ms Karen Beresford of the University of South Australia. They have researched the training needs of small business and have found small businesses' expenditure on training has been little affected by the training guarantee. They found that the training guarantee levy provides little incentive for small businesses to engage more fully in training activity and that the administration and record keeping required was disproportionately burdensome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fifth authority is a study by Tim Henson of Monash University's David Syme faculty of business. That study found that only four companies in 100 had anything positive to say about the training guarantee levy. In his report, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Respondents from all industry sectors stated that they are now simply documenting what was already done prior to the introduction of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The sixth authority is the Business Council of Australia. It regards the levy as an inappropriate way to encourage industry to train personnel. The seventh authority is the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry. It has called for the scrapping of the training guarantee levy. This is expressed not only by Mr Kelty of the trade union movement, but also by the  Business Council of Australia and the Australian Chamber of Commerce&mdash;end it, abolish it! What are the odds that the government will actually hear the overwhelming number of voices and that the Treasurer will do this in the May budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by making it clear that this has been the view of the Liberal and National parties all the way along. I remember the original debate in 1990, before the levy started operating on 1 July. We believed then that, whilst it is vital that there be investment in training in every area of Australian business and that we must be internationally competitive, this measure was not the way to get the best results. That was our view then; it has been our view every year since. It is our view now. We find the whole concert of Australian industry and business&mdash;large businesses and small businesses&mdash;academic and independent researchers, and Mr Kelty all agreeing with us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The training guarantee levy has failed. That is clear from all the evidence. Even the government's own advisory bodies have, at the least, grave reservations and, more typically, they call for its abolition. It is with this in mind that I will go on in the committee stage to move the three groups of amendments that I have indicated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the Training Guarantee (Administration) Amendment Bill. This is not a complex piece of legislation; it simply reaffirms and implements promises made by the government in the 1993 election campaign. Once again, these amendments demonstrate the government's willingness to listen to the genuine concerns being expressed by industry. The amendments made to the Training Guarantee (Administration) Act have been welcomed by small business. As Senator Teague has indicated, there has been some serious discussion about these issues before the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, of which I am a member. I will come back to those remarks in a moment because I think that there is perhaps another side to this story that needs to be put to the Senate today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, these proposals provide a greater flexibility of planning of training expenditure, which allows for the carryover of expenditure from one year to another, but not indefinitely. I think that is an important consideration because it ensures that employers are meeting their responsibilities to both this country at large and to their particular work force. It also allows for shortfalls to be carried over from one year to another and, effectively, to average out expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It clears up some anomalies which are associated with apprenticeships and other training subsidies. It provides additional incentives to employers for apprenticeship training. It broadens the types of equipment that can be described for training purposes and the eligibility of various types of equipment for training purposes. That includes rental, hire and lease, and depreciation expenses on property and other equipment that is used for training purposes for any part of the year. That is an extremely generous provision of this legislation. I wonder whether other taxpayers will be enjoying the benefits that are contained within this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also seeks to provide changes to protect the public interest where liquidators are appointed to companies that go broke. To protect the public interest in that regard is entirely appropriate. To further assist small business its measures will apply retrospectively to 1 July 1993. So it is quite a generous package of measures. No wonder small business has welcomed these measures. I note that members of the opposition are saying that they do not really oppose the amendments; what they oppose is the principle of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we found when the Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training took evidence. The objections were not to the amendments but to the principle of the act. The objections, essentially, were ideological. There were concerns that the government was asking people to contribute to the training of employees and that the state should withdraw from any enforcement of measures which would require employers to meet their obligations, both to this country and to their workers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense, the dispute essentially is ideological. If people believe that business should be unfettered and that government should not encourage certain types of behaviour and business practice, irrespective of the benefit to the country at large, and irrespective of the benefit to business, workers and industry as a whole, then they would argue that this bill should contain sunset clauses. In fact, that has been proposed here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an ideological commitment by people who do not believe that the government has a legitimate role in encouraging certain types of behaviour and economic activity. I put it that training is an essential part of economic activity. </PARA>

They have sought the establishment of a body to monitor the scheme. As Senator Bell indicated in the committee bulletin of February 1994, in general he supported the provisions but thought there needed to be further improvements.

<PARA>That essentially has been the position of those opposite for the last couple of years. In my judgment that is another example of the way in which the Liberal Party is operating within a policy vacuum. Particularly in education&mdash;which disturbs me greatly&mdash;a real position has not been put forward by the conservative parties about the way to advance public education, and training in particular, and the way the government legitimately should be involved in that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are complaints and whingeing and whining about whether people are ripping off the scheme.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government, on the other hand, remains firmly committed to producing a highly skilled work force. Part of that is the training guarantee levy. As has been indicated by Senator Teague, this measure was introduced 3 1/2 years ago. I believe that the training guarantee levy remains a very effective vehicle for the achievement of that aim of producing a highly skilled work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that is not to say it is perfect. As part of a consultative process, a reference group has been established to inform and seek views of the major stakeholders in this area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the original bill was introduced in August 1990, the minister said then that the scheme would need to be reviewed after a period of operation, to ensure it meets its original objectives. That review is currently under way and will conclude in October 1994. It will provide an opportunity for interested groups to make further comments on its findings. I trust that it will be the catalyst for broad community debate about the whole question of training and the most effective way to achieve the stated objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In such a comprehensive review there will be broad sampling to ensure there is an adequate basis for judgments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw recently a National Safety Council of Australia study which showed that the lack of training for people at work was leading directly to the deaths and maiming of workers. Some 600 workers a year were dying as a result of inadequate training. So I want to talk about the role of the market. In a case like this we can see clearly that there is a totally inadequate response, if one was to rely on the market, for the provision of adequate training. In the occupational health and safety area there are 600 deaths per year. Some 500,000 Australians were injured at work as a result of the failure to provide adequate training in the workplace. </PARA>

When we look at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> we can see quite clearly that the evidence goes the other way. The study examined 100 injuries and found that 56 per cent of employers did not provide employees with induction training and 70 per cent neglected refresher training.

<PARA>This report by the Australian Research Council, endorsed by the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, takes up the minister's reference from September 1990, a long time ago, to give advice with regard to the distribution of research effort in Australia compared with that internationally. The indications at that time were that Australia was underproviding, particularly in a number of areas of research effort, compared with other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was ringing some alarm bells in the sense that Australia was not making sufficient provision for research in the applied sciences, in the natural sciences, in the social sciences, in humanities and, indeed, even in terms of higher education research itself. There was some preliminary work done, and this report is the result of a more thorough evaluation by the Australian Research Council. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at the work done by Professor Brennan as chairman of the Australian Research Council, referring it on to NBEET, which Mr Peter Laver chairs, I find that there are some rather unsurprising conclusions. Today I have been able to read carefully only the executive summary and the main council conclusions, and I have looked at the structure of some of the tables of the report, all of which appear very interesting. But the outcome appears to be in danger of being a truism, a motherhood statement. I hesitate to say too much about it, but it is possibly self-serving or complacent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report there are no alarm bells, except perhaps to say that engineering and the physical sciences are underprovided for when we make international comparisons. The social sciences are highly provided for in terms of international comparisons. There is low provision for higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But a lot of this report is devoted to trying to define how to put together the three types of research funding that we have in Australia: that which is funded through infrastructure, that which is by specific grant such as through the ARC, and that which is through professional bodies like CSIRO and even Defence which provide additional government moneys for research. It is very difficult to see these three types of funding being duplicated&mdash;I should say triplicated&mdash;in other countries so as to compare kind with kind. A lot of the report deals with how to make assessments of those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was inadequate Australian data for a start, and ABS was requested to come up with material which was up-to-date as at September 1993. So the outcome of this report is that some of the things feared three years ago are no longer so feared. There is some reassurance, but I am not greatly assisted by this. I do not feel reassured.

<PARA>Much more recently than the Australian Research Council report which we have just been discussing, in February 1992 the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, referred a very carefully defined reference to the Australian Language and Literacy Council, which is one of the five councils under NBEET.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you will very well recall that, when you were chairman after me of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training, we carried out an inquiry into a national language policy for Australia. That very substantial report, regarded by most people involved with language matters in Australia as a landmark report, was unanimous, and it was one that you, I and a number of other senators contributed to very substantially.

<PARA>These documents all come from the Department of Finance. The first two documents are financial statement guidelines for departmental secretaries and cover accrual reporting and modified cash reporting. The third is the guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the first of those documents. It is the first and long overdue step to implementation of accrual accounting in the Public Service. The second document, which deals with modified cash reporting, has similar connotations. The third one is a further update of the guidelines for financial statements of public authorities and commercial activities. Again, that has similar connotations, although in a slightly wider area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The guidelines I am particularly interested in are those for accrual accounting. In November 1992 the then Minister for Finance announced that Commonwealth departments were to move to financial reporting on an accrual basis. At the time, the minister said that the move to accrual accounting would be progressively introduced and would include a trial period in several government departments. The guidelines that are now being published have been developed following that pilot program and in conjunction with those departments that are indicating an intention to participate in the trial. They apply to the departments who have elected to prepare financial statements on an accrual basis for the financial year ended 30 June 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the essential elements of these guidelines and for accrual accounting, which is part of the general purpose financial reports, is to enable financial information to be presented in a manner which assists management in discharging its accountability. Accrual reporting provides information aimed at satisfying that objective. A similar situation arises in the case of modified cash reporting, where the objective of promoting accountability and financial management requires information which goes beyond that which has been provided by traditional cash accounting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition welcomes these guidelines because they will assist greatly in improving accountability of the public sector. They will increase accountability and the transparency and comparability of information. This government has an appalling record when it comes to accountability. Indeed, Labor's lack of accountability&mdash;its disdain for it&mdash;lies at the core of the political corruption that is a canker at the very heart of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the most recent example of that lack of accountability in the sports rorts debacle of recent days. Although this matter has attracted publicity in recent days, it in fact goes back five years to when Senator Richardson was the architect of the scheme, which was designed for no other reason than to buy votes in marginal electorates. We have seen many other examples of this political corruption through the government's lack of accountability in other areas. We have seen the funding of trade union activities by this government. When we throw in everything, we find that this government has spent up to $150 million on the trade unions in the last 10 years. Much of the government's funding of ethnic community organisations has also been blatant vote buying. As a result of that, many very worthwhile organisations have missed out on funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators might remember that, also in the area of environmental funding, Senator Richardson boasted that he won the 1990 election for Labor because he had organised the Green vote&mdash;again, using taxpayers' money as a bribe on numerous occasions.

I hope these guidelines will help to bring greater accountability into the whole process of public sector funding. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the higher education funding for the 1994-96 triennium. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This particular document sets out how the government intends to spend money in higher education over the next three years. The amount intended to be spent in 1996 involves $5 billion in allocations&mdash;an increase of $66.1 million per year. The coalition has considerable concerns about the directions indicated by this document.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last six years, there have been incredible changes in the higher education sector. They can be best summarised by saying that the government has provided insufficient resources for the expansion that has taken place. The disturbing thing about this document is that it shows a continuation of this very worrying trend. I wish to highlight a few points that the document makes about what our universities are doing in areas of importance to the future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first point relates to something that Senator Teague talked about a little earlier in relation to another document&mdash;research infrastructure in this country. As Senator Teague pointed out, it is completely inadequate. Projections show that this inadequacy will continue into the future. For research infrastructure, the government has what it calls mechanisms A, B and C. Mechanism A relates to the support of Australian Research Council grants. We have a shocking situation in this country at the moment where only 20 per cent of applicants for grants gain funding, even though it is commonly agreed that at least 40 per cent of the applications are very worthy of funding. Research efforts go down the drain because this government is not prepared to support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mechanism B relates to the old college institutes that recently became universities. It was to enable these institutions to catch up. Of course, the amount of money which has been put into this has been inadequate. The government, after three years, is now proposing to phase out this money. These institutions will not become full-blown research institutions. They will be greatly disadvantaged for other reasons which I will point out a little later. There is also the danger that we could return to the old binary system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the government's greatest inadequacy in this area has been in relation to libraries. The Boston Consulting Group recommended for this type of infrastructure, mechanism C, that another $125 million be spent annually on it. The government's response to this is to spend $3.5 million. We heard tonight from the AVCC that it is a bit of a pea and thimble trick because the government has actually, through the research quantum, grabbed back another $19.5 million. So it appears as though the government has increased the funding slightly when it has really decreased it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some extremely worrying trends in the research area. Overall, probably the most worrying thing about this document is the way it stunts overall growth of this sector. Obviously, the government is sending out a signal to the community that it is approaching the limits of its capacity to fund higher education from public moneys. One of the reasons is that it is not allowing a whole source of other funding which could come into higher education to come into this sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area is being stifled because of the way in which the government has centralised bureaucratic controls. Again, we learnt from the ABC people tonight that, despite what DEET says in estimates about freeing things up, the government is really making it harder. Money is being allocated, perhaps quite rightly, to growth areas with new populations and to disadvantaged areas, but the real problem is that the overall amount of money is not sufficient for what is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us hope that the government starts to get the message on higher education and becomes less centralised and less bureaucratic and frees up this system. As indicated in the document, the current trends tend to cast some doubt that the government has learnt the lessons of the last few years. We urge it to return a lot more autonomy to the universities. It is only in this way that we will have a really first-class university system. At the moment it is being sent back in the other direction, and this should be of great concern to all Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted to raise two matters on the adjournment. First, I made some statements to the Senate last year in relation to report No. 21 of the Auditor-General on Australian Government credit cards, which was quite a damning report on their use. During my discussion of that report I made mention of ATSIC as an organisation not training its people in the use of that card. I had been confused on that day because I had recently read an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 14 December reporting on Arch Bevis's report on Purchasing Australia and the use of credit cards. It was incorrectly reported in that article that ATSIC had no training in the use of those cards. I recently received a letter from the Chairman of ATSIC, Lois O'Donoghue, informing me that ATSIC does not use the credit cards and therefore has no requirement for the training. I repeated that which had been said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. I was wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 24 February I wrote to Ms O'Donoghue apologising unreservedly for that mistake, and further pointing out&mdash;not to try to lessen my guilt&mdash;that the cause of my misunderstanding was the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> wherein Mr Bevis had been reported as saying that ATSIC had no training and also noting a letter which the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) had written to the Bevis committee saying that ATSIC did not use the cards and therefore needed no training. I made the point that it is unusual that the minister had brought Mr Bevis's committee's attention to that fact and had still perpetuated the misunderstanding about ATSIC's use of the cards. So, I take this occasion to apologise on the public record and in the Senate to ATSIC for the mistake I made, and I do so unreservedly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other discussion point I raise in the adjournment debate tonight relates to an article I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on page 49; it was the property page from last Wednesday's edition of 23 February 1994. It draws the attention of readers, under a sort of gossip column part of the property page, to the fact that the former Premier of Western Australia, Dr Carmen Lawrence, has put her property in Lawler Street, Subiaco, on the market for a price of $395,000 through the local agency of Paxton Hoad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know Lawler Street well. It is a very nice, leafy street. The agents from Paxton Hoad&mdash;a most reputable and experienced firm of agents in the Subiaco area of Western Australia&mdash;describe the property thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">three-bedroom home, warm and homely, with fireplaces in each bedroom, ornate ceilings and a neat and attractive garden with big trees and sundeck at the back.</PARA>
<PARA>As Niki Peinke, the agent in control of the property, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">People fall over themselves to get into Lawler Street.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important to have a look at the context in which Dr Lawrence is actually selling her property in Subiaco. There are a couple of points. Dr Lawrence, being a candidate in the Fremantle by-election on 12 March, has one of those in mind, and that is that she is so certain that the people of Fremantle will elect her that she has put her place on the market and said she is looking around for a house in Fremantle. In amongst visiting nursing homes and doing other potential breaches of the electoral act she is also looking for a house in Fremantle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable senators that the Liberal candidate in the by-election in the seat of Fremantle, Mr Geoff Horne, has made a commitment to the people of Fremantle that he will also move to the electorate if he is successful in getting elected. Being a former Army man and lately an investigator with the Australian Securities Commission, Geoff Horne is not so arrogant towards the people of Fremantle as to take for granted the decision that they will make on 12 March. He is prepared to wait, go down to Fremantle and put his case to the people door to door, community group by community group, and seek their support. If he gets it, he will, as a man of his word and an officer in the Australian Army, move down to Fremantle. He is not prepared to be so arrogant as to presume that the people of Fremantle will just vote for him because he has been anointed by Paul Keating and other members of the factional right wing machine over here in Canberra. He is prepared to seek the judgment of the people of Fremantle and to move to Fremantle if he is honoured with their vote and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other important things about the $395,000 is that it brought to my mind the whole affair about Dr Carmen Lawrence when she had, for a period of nearly two years, an amount of $5,000 in her private bank account which had been paid into that bank account on the assumption that she was to take an overseas trip approximately two years before the last election. At about the time she had that amount paid into her personal account for overseas travel the former Premier, Peter Dowding, was over in Sweden. Carmen Lawrence and Stephen Smith&mdash;who is now the member for Perth&mdash;were plotting, while Mr Dowding was over in Sweden on a trade mission for Western Australia, to unseat Mr Dowding and install Carmen in the leadership of the Labor Party and therefore the premiership of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the police investigated the payment of this $5,000,  they found it had been sitting in her private bank account for two years; she did not take the trip because she had by then become the Premier,. The public explanation&mdash;and I presume to the police&mdash;was that she had forgotten that the amount was in her bank account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to believe the fact that she says she has forgotten. She was the premier of Western Australia, and we have to look up to public figures, even though it is a bit hard to do it from time to time in this place. I see from the transcript of the WA Inc. royal commission that whenever Dr Lawrence was asked questions about crucial WA Inc dealings within the Western Australian cabinet&mdash;the PICL deal, and the whole range of dealings&mdash;her answer on a number of occasions was `I forget' or `I do not recall' or `I do not remember'. So the fact that the former Premier of Western Australia, now the Labor candidate in Fremantle, forgot that she had $5,000 in her account may not be unusual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in Lawler Street, Subiaco, live in very nice houses and probably have good jobs and good incomes, but not many of them would tell you that they would forget that they had $5,000 too much or too little in their accounts. The people in the seat of Fremantle have a lower average income and the average house price in that area is much lower&mdash;indeed, I would suggest the average house price in Fremantle is nearer to $100,000 than $300,000. Those people would certainly know whether they had $5,000 in their bank accounts. It is important for anyone who goes to Lawler Street and looks at Dr Lawrence's house to realise that, at a price of $395,000, there is a bit of negotiability. When Carmen Lawrence gets an offer of acceptance put on her desk, she will not notice whether the figure is $395,000 or $390,000. I encourage people who go to look at Dr Lawrence's house not to worry too much about $5,000&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a real estate analyst in a former life. The other sad thing about this case is that when the police investigated the $5,000 that Carmen Lawrence forgot, she understood the police were investigating it and she wanted to throw some mud at the then Leader of the Opposition, Richard Court. She dragged up the whole sordid affair that involved Mr Easton and Penny Easton. Carmen Lawrence was party to having a petition laid on the table of the Legislative Assembly in Western Australia. The raising of that event again caused so much concern to Mr Easton's wife, Penny, that she took her own life the day following the tabling and, in a suicide note, blamed the political circumstances. I support the assertion of the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey) that Dr Lawrence has blood on her hands. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not intend to speak in this debate but, on behalf of the government, I cannot let the most extraordinary remarks of Senator Campbell go without the strongest protest. I do not know whether his remarks are unparliamentary. I have never been a great one to take objection to the language people use in parliament; one is  judged by one's own performance. But it is an extraordinary allegation to say that a citizen of Australia, whether a member of parliament or not, has blood on her hands and then to directly relate that to a suicide. Unless Senator Campbell can absolutely substantiate it, it is one of the worst smears I have ever heard in 25 years of public life, whether in the Senate or as a party official looking at all sides of politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If what Senator Campbell has said is true&mdash;that Carmen Lawrence has blood on her hands and it is directly related to a person's death by suicide&mdash;I would have thought he should have gone to the police with that information. He is saying that Carmen Lawrence murdered this person. It is an extraordinary allegation. Senator Campbell has trumped it up and dropped it into an adjournment debate in this way because he thinks that under privilege the smear will work. It is an extraordinary smear. I will not ask him to withdraw it because I want him to be condemned for saying it. It is on the record. Senator Campbell in this Senate and the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey, in the other place have put these things on the record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell knows that if he said such a thing outside this place he would probably cop an action for defamation&mdash;probably criminal defamation. I have no doubt that he would be sued. I support parliamentary privilege because, in the last resort, it may be the only place where people can raise issues of human rights and criminal matters or expose corruption and so on. I have always supported that principle, but there is a responsibility on all senators and all House of Representatives members to understand it is a privilege given by the Australian people to elected members of parliament. It should not be abused in the way that Senator Campbell has most appallingly done. </PARA>
