<PARA>I draw the attention of my colleagues to the content of the notice of motion. We are well aware that we have only a very short time left in the sitting hours of this Senate, and that is why it is urgent that this matter be debated. There is a principle at stake, which is the principle of whether this chamber determines its program, whether the government determines the program, whether the bureaucrats who write the legislation determine the priority of the program, or whether a whips' meeting, which has occurred, can determine the program. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The list that will be circulated sets out the bills that have been introduced into the Senate this sitting. It has been agreed by the various parties in the Senate, in a meeting out of Senate time, that some of the bills will be debated in the next session and some will be debated in the remaining week or so of this session. I believe this chamber is the right and appropriate place to make that decision rather than to have it made for us. It may be a simple formality. I am asking that my motion be agreed to so that we can have a precedent and so that a vote can be taken on whether certain bills are debated in this session or adjourned to the following session.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My motion may require some amendment&mdash;I understand the opposition will be looking at this&mdash;to include the particular bills that have been circulated. We may have to go through them and vote on the elimination of some of those bills from my notice of motion and the inclusion of the ones which all parties in the Senate agree are of sufficient urgency and where the government has presented enough rationalisation and justification for them to be considered in this sitting. Those bills can then be dealt with this session and the remainder adjourned to the next session. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am trying to point out to everybody why it is urgent to consider this. If we do not, on a de facto basis we would be agreeing that the program can be determined outside this chamber; that an exception can be made to a procedure that was accepted within this chamber as appropriate; and that our priority of business can be determined without any reference to this chamber. If we fail to consider the motion today, we will be accepting that whatever is organised in meetings in offices and outside this chamber is acceptable to this chamber. I urge my colleagues to support this motion that the matter be debated, because I think there is much more to be said about it than simply the matters I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not consider the motion today, when are we going to? We are about to embark on an altered program which contains bills which have been introduced this session. We are giving de facto agreement to the violation of the principle Senator Evans announced he would adhere to that bills which were introduced in one session would be considered and debated in the next, unless we were convinced in the chamber that they were urgent and were special bills and the government had very good reason for considering them now. I see no problem with making that exception. This chamber should make the exceptions; it should not be done by a meeting of the parties or the whips outside the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not support the suspension of standing orders moved by Senator Chamarette. Senator Chamarette's motion purports to be about the orderly process of debating bills in the Senate. The actual effect of it would be to add very significantly to the amount of time required to debate legislation by having a procedural debate on the urgency of each bill in this category prior to consideration by the Senate and have each bill in this category determined by Senator Chamarette. That would mean, in addition to what we have on our program, 28 procedural debates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has provided the Senate with reasons for the urgency of bills that are being introduced in this session of parliament. Details of those reasons were tabled in the chamber on 31 August for bills that were introduced prior to that time and for subsequent bills reasons have also been provided to non-government senators. Senator Chamarette now wants a debate on those reasons and by implication, I think, for the Senate to go beyond its scrutiny role and tell the executive what its priorities should and should not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Evans gave a commitment, which he did, and put forward the objective of introduction of bills one session for debate in the next, he made several qualifications very clear at the time. One of those qualifications was the understanding that there would be a need for urgent legislation, that there were urgent bills and that many of these bills were related to measures that the government had brought down in the budget. Every senator in the chamber knows that there is always going to be a need for urgent bills and budget related bills to be introduced in one session for passage in that session. It will always be impossible to anticipate the urgent legislation that will be required in certain sessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government did introduce new arrangements to inform senators about urgent legislation and the reasons for that urgency. I think that is an entirely reasonable and proper approach for the government to take. It has been fully consultative in the way we have dealt with this issue and an entirely reasonable approach in these circumstances. There have been suggestions with the opposition, the Democrats, the Green senators and Senator Harradine about innovative ways we can maximise the amount of time we have remaining. As a result, I do not believe an extra sitting week will be necessary this year. So we have further prioritised the remaining bills that are on the legislative program. By sitting some extra hours over the next two weeks, I believe we can achieve the objectives of more orderly business management in the Senate and the passage of urgent legislation. I do believe that debate on this motion is unnecessary. We should be getting on with the business instead of having an enormous number of unnecessary and time wasting procedural debates. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This should be a matter of great embarrassment for the government because it has failed to meet its undertakings to provide the chamber with an orderly program. The commitment it gave, of course, was that now that we have three separate sessions in parliament during the year it would give proper notice of its legislative program and it would do that by giving notice of bills in the session previous to that in which it intended to have the bills debated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In so many instances it has failed to live up to that undertaking, which is one of the reasons why we have got to the end of this session with such a massive workload that cannot be processed to the standard we regard as desirable within the time available. Therefore, we believe Senator Chamarette's motion in principle has merit. If the government is going to breach its undertaking to the chamber, then in each instance it should make its case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that there will be exceptional circumstances in which it would require debate of a piece of legislation without giving the sort of notice which I just mentioned and which it has undertaken to give. It may be in relation to matters of benefits to the less well off in our community; it might be a variation to pensions or some instance arising out of the issue of long-term unemployment for which the government has proposals. We have doubts about some of those proposals; but we regard it as in the interests of the nation for the matters to be debated during the session in which the changes were proposed rather than for them to be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no procedure at the moment that requires the government to make that case in the chamber. Therefore, we see merit within the spirit of what Senator Chamarette is proposing and, certainly, we agree to such a change to our orders so that in the future, if the government seeks to have any piece of legislation debated without having given notice in the previous session, it will have to argue the urgency of it in this place. Whether the legislation gets debated will depend on whether it can achieve the numbers necessary for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have to deal with the current program. As we know, a large number of bills fall into this category. On this side of the chamber we have, as has been said, privately&mdash;not in the chamber, but in accordance with past and usual practice&mdash;sat down with other parties and the individual Independent senator and discussed what the government was intending in its program. We on this side of the chamber have made an assessment as to which bills we regard as urgent and requiring debate in this session without prior notice having been given and we have indicated to the government and to other minority parties what those bills are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, Senator Chamarette is saying that she does not want 28 separate procedural debates on the 28 bills that fall within that category, but she wishes to have the reasons why that package of bills should be treated as urgent on the public record rather than simply on the private record. I do not have any objection to that. I cannot see why history should not record the circumstances in which we agreed to waive the breach by the government of its undertaking. But the motion before us does not adequately achieve what she now says she is prepared to accept&mdash;that is, one debate rather than 28 procedural debates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats do not support this motion for the suspension of standing orders. I agree with Senator Hill in some respects regarding the government's management of its program. I suggest to some ministers that they go back and speak to their departments, because it is my impression that some departments still have not caught up with the fact that we have a May budget. Having had a May budget, it is unacceptable that we are still receiving legislation emanating from that budget with important start-up dates&mdash;from 1 January next year and beyond that. So I think some ministerial direction needs to be given to some departments. If we are here this time next year, we would expect to see an improvement in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding what Senator Hill said that he can accept by way of an amendment, I would say that Senator Chamarette is being a little disingenuous. The government did organise meetings for party leaders and whips in this chamber. We all attended the first meeting. Senator Chamarette chose not to attend the second one where we heard the government's arguments as to why particular bills were considered urgent. We agreed or disagreed and put our own arguments&mdash;as Senator Hill did, ably&mdash;regarding what we believed was urgent or not urgent. The list that has been devised is as a result of that cooperative discussion. It is not just the government's priorities that are reflected there; it is as a result of the discussion which was held by everyone present at that meeting. I do not think the debate has reflected that yet. I do not believe it is necessary to do this today. I will wait and hear what occurs in the debate tomorrow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to assure the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Faulkner, that there is no intention on my part, and I am sure no intention on the part of Senator Chamarette, who moved this motion, to hijack the agenda of the government. What is being sought is to entrench in a procedural way the ideal that Senator Gareth Evans outlined to the Senate last June&mdash;that it was the government's intention to introduce legislation in one session and debate it in the next. The reason for that was part of this accountability issue. The importance of that is obvious. If the people of Australia are to be confident that this parliament is dealing with legislation in a proper and orderly manner, then something needs to be done, because the impression out there at present is that this place is a shemozzle. That is partly true and partly untrue. Nevertheless, I think it is important that when legislation is introduced it be laid on the table so that not only interest groups&mdash;very often they know beforehand what is going to be introduced; sometimes before we do&mdash;but also ordinary members of the public will know what is contained in government legislation so that they can then make representations to members of parliament about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with that? A very important part of our function is the representative function. What I am concerned about&mdash;I am sure Senator Chamarette and those supporting the motion are also concerned about it&mdash;and what Senator Evans, presumably, has in mind is to ensure that there is an opportunity for the public to know what is in the legislation well prior to it being debated in substance in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all right for the whips and others to get together&mdash;and of course I am invited to those meetings&mdash;to make arrangements as they see fit. But when it comes to the question of having some bills as exceptions to the rule, I believe that is a matter that ought to be quite open and public. I agree with what Senator Chamarette said: the government does owe it to the public to have its reasons for the urgency of bills put on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important matter. I was delighted when I heard Senator Evans say that we should introduce it in one session and debate it in the next. As far as I am concerned, that is great because, additionally, it gives independent senators and others who have to get over a whole range of legislation time to consider, time to consult and so on. Any procedure that is likely to entrench that principle into being I am in favour of. That is why I am in favour of the motion to suspend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the government that, from my point of view, it is certainly not an attempt to hijack the agenda of the government. The government has an agenda. It is entitled to pursue that agenda as it sees fit. In the interests of good government, in the interests of this parliament&mdash;and particularly this chamber to properly review the legislation&mdash;and in the interests of freedom of information and the ability of the public to be able to express its views on the specifics of legislation, all we are saying is that at least this particular motion is going along that particular path, and I support it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 30 June 1994 a draft of this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives to enable exposure for public comment and consultation on the principles and policies with major institutions involved in family law namely the Family Court of Australia, the Family Court of Western Australia, the Family Law Council and the Family Law Section of the Law Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those consultations were most productive in identifying some weaknesses with the original bill. The government thanks those who gave of their time and expertise to advance the quality of this legislation. Although there was broad agreement with the significant change of approach in dealing with matrimonial breakdown there remain some differences of view with the detail of the provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every member and senator of this parliament receives more representations on dissatisfaction with, and perceived inequities arising out of, the operation of the Family Law Act 1975 and its companion child support legislation than any other issue. People suffering significant emotional trauma and anguish as a result of the family breakdown naturally turn to their local member for help to reopen the matter to achieve "justice". Those approaches often raise feelings of despair in us when the opportunities to assist are inevitably limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of those who seek our assistance believe that their partner has been responsible for their traumatic situation. Further, most of them believe that the law and the legal system is assisting that partner to exploit the breakdown to their own advantage. The report of the recent Joint Select Committee on Family Law found that that view was erroneous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the contrary, the committee found that, as a general rule, the act itself was an effective vehicle for the administration of family law matters in Australia. Nevertheless, the committee made 120 recommendations for reform of that law within the existing framework of the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Family law is the field in which more citizens will have direct contact with the law than any other aspect of the law. It is for this reason that this government announced, on its election, that family law reform was a major priority. The government's initiatives in mediation and other ADR mechanisms in family law are a strategic aspect of its efforts to reduce the need for court action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Family Law Act 1975 was one of the great social and legislative reforms of the Whitlam government and is not yet 20 years old. Despite this, it has been the subject of two broad ranging parliamentary joint select committee inquiries resulting in a very large number of recommendations for reform. As well, particular aspects of the act have been examined and recommendations for reform made by bodies such as the Family Law Council and the Australian Law Reform Commission. Many of the recommendations for reform by those non-parliamentary inquiries have been given effect to in recent years. The government's response to the recent joint select committee report accepted the major thrust of its recommendations. By implementing those recommendations which the government accepts the parliament should go a long way in providing a simpler, fairer and speedier family law justice system for all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to give effect to those recommendations relating to Part VII of the Family Law Act dealing with children and to clarify and extend the alternative dispute resolution mechanisms available in family law. The government also intends to introduce into the House of Representatives this sitting a further bill dealing with recommendations of the joint select committee on matrimonial property, pre-nuptial financial agreements and some other miscellaneous issues. The government anticipate that this further bill will be passed by the parliament early next year to enable the commencement of all the amendments together in the second half of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once amended by this bill the act will emphasise the importance the government places on methods of dispute resolution other than litigation by categorising counselling and mediation as primary dispute resolution. Couples whose relationships have broken down will thus be encouraged to seek a settlement of their differences through these mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is already committed to significant funding of a range of programs for marriage and family skills&mdash;marriage counselling, family mediation and family skills and breakdown prevention&mdash;marriage education. In 1993/94 grants for these purposes totalled $20.7 million. In addition to the funding already provided, a large number of the joint select committee recommendations had budgetary implications either for additional funding of existing programs or the establishment of new programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A modest start to implementation of these recommendations was made in the recent budget. Further consideration will be given to implementation of the remaining recommendations in future budgets. As family law is one of the main areas where Australians come into contact with Commonwealth laws particular consideration will be given to the level and priority of family law funding in the context of a justice statement that the Prime Minister proposes to make early next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am particularly pleased that a start was made on the provision of funding for mediation. This is favoured as a means of enabling separating parties to solve their differences for themselves rather than leaving the problem in the hands of lawyers and judges. Community-based mediation services have been funded for some years and this is continuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The additional funding in this year's budget is a seeding allocation to enable mediation services to be provided in a number of alternative ways and evaluated on a consistent basis to ensure that the services being provided are both effective and appropriate. This funding follows the completion of a successful pilot of mediation in the family court. It provides funding to both court annexed and community based mediation. This will enable government to access a range of options as to where the emphasis for the delivery of mediation services should be placed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Counselling provided for by the act has been extended to recognise and make provision for mediation services in family law to be delivered by community based organisations and approved individuals possessing the necessary qualifications for delivering mediation services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes significant changes to the existing provisions relating to counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It provides a wider scope for community based counselling than has been available in the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also extends the ambit of counselling. The limitations in the current definition of marriage counselling prevented counselling of some family issues or concerns being handled by these community based bodies. The bill now includes a definition of family and child counselling which will enable community based bodies to engage in a much broader range of counselling than before, in particular counselling in relation to children whether the parties are married or not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A significant departure in this bill from the approach recommended by the joint select committee is in the relationship between children and their parents. The committee recommended that the existing terminology of guardianship, custody and access should be retained. That terminology suffers from connotations of proprietorial rights in children delivering them as the spoils of victory to the parent gaining custody.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government was not convinced of the select committee's view that a change in terminology and approach was unnecessary and sought from the Family Law Council a report on the operation of the Children Act 1989 (UK). This act has moved away from the existing approach in Australia. I thank the council for its prompt and incisive report which was tabled on 3 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is over a century since legislators removed the notion of husbands having `property or ownership' in married women. Surprisingly, some adults still adhere to this `property' notion in respect of their offspring, particularly as a basis of power vis-a-vis the other parent. Dr Don Browning, Professor of Ethics and Psychological Studies at the University of Chicago, in May of this year whilst addressing an International Year of the Family seminar in Melbourne, said "parents had become too selfish and tended to put their own needs ahead of those of their children". Many of the representations that senators receive seem to bear out that view.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks to redress that proprietorial attitude in a number of important ways.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1990 Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. That convention contains a number of basic rights in the raising and development of children toward adulthood. The objects clause to the new Part VII of this bill gives recognition to such rights by specifying a number of such rights that should be observed in any agreements or decisions concerning children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the bill clarifies a general community misconception that parents have rights in respect of children. The bill gives legislative recognition to the common law principle, enunciated in the UK case of Gillick v West Norfolk and Wisbech A.H.A. and adopted by the majority of the High Court in Secretary, Department of Health and Community Services v JWB and SMB (Marion's case), that `the principle of law is that parental rights are derived from parental duty and exist only so long as they are needed for the protection of the person and property of the child.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is drafted on the basis of parental responsibilities for the care, welfare and development of children. Also the provisions are drafted to enable parties to understand the legislative approach and feel confident in negotiating and agreeing between themselves a proper basis for discharging all those responsibilities in an atmosphere where the child feels love from the parents and is free from the traumatic circumstances that seem to characterise many marital breakdowns at present.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is consistent with the government's aim to encourage the use of ADR mechanisms. The bill aims to assist parents to agree arrangements for their children rather than having solutions imposed on them. Division 4 of Part VII of the bill contains provisions for parenting plans and encourages their use. Such plans are registerable and enforceable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where agreement is unable to be achieved Division 5 of Part VII now provides for a significantly changed range of court orders in respect of the relationship between the parents and the child. It provides for residence, contact and special purpose orders. Unless a special purpose order is made removing a parent's requirement to undertake some or all the responsibilities for the care welfare and development of a child those responsibilities are to be exercised jointly. This is a major departure from the present law under which the custodial parent exercises daily care and control of the child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 7 of Part VII repeats, with only minor modification, a number of the existing maintenance provisions and the location and recovery of children provisions, to reflect these changes in terminology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 11 of Part VII introduces into the act new provisions for dealing with family violence. It also addresses inconsistency between state and territory restraining orders and contact orders under this act. These provisions give effect to the agreement that has been reached in the Standing Committee of Attorney's-General on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill re-enacts a number of other provisions of the present act without modification to make the changes in terminology complete for that part of the act dealing with children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Next year will mark the 20th anniversary of the passage of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act was the first specific Commonwealth law on human rights. It was based on the fundamental belief that all Australians irrespective of race, colour or national or ethnic origin are entitled to fair treatment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this country, we take pride in the community's consensus that everyone should be able to advance through life on their own efforts and abilities; that it is wrong to judge anyone on the colour of their skin or the sound of their accent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Be it under a law, or in employment, or the provision of services, or access to facilities and accommodation, discrimination based on racial prejudice and intolerance is addressed by the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The law provides a remedy to those who have experienced discrimination. It exists because, even with general community tolerance, we know racism exists. And racism leads to discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Racial Discrimination Act does not eliminate racist attitudes. It does not try to, for a law cannot change what people think. But it does target behaviour&mdash;behaviour that causes an individual to suffer discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parliament is now being asked to pass a new law dealing with racism in Australia. It too targets behaviour&mdash;behaviour which affects not only the individual but the community as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Racial Hatred Bill is about the protection of groups and individuals from threats of violence and the incitement of racial hatred, which leads inevitably to violence. It enables the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to conciliate complaints of racial abuse.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is controversial. It has generated much comment and raises difficult issues for the parliament to consider. It calls for a careful decision on principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I wish to address the issues most consistently raised in the public debate and then examine the provisions of the bill in detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is intended to  close a gap in the legal protection available to the victims of extreme racist behaviour. No Australian should live in fear because of his or her race, colour or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation will provide a safety net for racial harmony in Australia, as both a warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance and an assurance to their potential victims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three major inquiries have found gaps in the protection provided by the Racial Discrimination Act. The National Inquiry into Racist Violence, the Australian Law Reform Commission Report into Multiculturalism and the Law, and the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody all argued in favour of an extension of Australia's human rights regime to explicitly protect the victims of extreme racism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 report of the National Inquiry into Racist Violence found that while state and territory criminal law punishes the perpetrators of violence, it largely is inadequate to deal with conduct that is a pre-condition of racial violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report documented 60 such incidents. The Law Reform Commission report and the Royal Commission also dealt extensively with examples of extreme racist behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since then there has been an upsurge in the activities of extremist racist groups which have resulted in harassment and intimidation of individuals. As well, public gatherings of ethnic communities have been disrupted, sometimes violently. In Sydney, police are investigating seven arson attacks on synagogues in less than four years. In Melbourne there have been reports of teenage gangs targeting Australians of Asian background.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these incidents are not everyday occurrences, they tear at the fabric of our society and cause immense concern to many of our citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Racism is often a by-product of ignorance and education is an essential part of any response. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission has a number of programs which target racism in schools, reinforced by a variety of programs run by educational authorities. The Commission also provides resources to help employers deal with racism in the workplace. The Commission will also be conducting a public education program to promote this legislation upon its passage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Racism should be responded to by education and by confronting the expression of racist ideas. But legislation is not mutually exclusive of these responses. It is not a choice between legislation or education. Rather, it is in the government's view, a case of using both.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no doubt that the Racial Discrimination Act has been a powerful influence on the rejection of racist attitudes over the past two decades. It has forced many people to confront racist views and have them debunked. It can be compared to the contribution of the Sex Discrimination Act over the past 10 years to improving the way women are treated in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill has been mainly criticised on the grounds that it limits free expression and that to enact such legislation undermines one of the most fundamental principles of our democratic society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet few of these critics would argue that free expression should be absolute and unfettered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout Australia, at all levels of government, free expression has had some limits placed on it when there is a countervailing public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laws dealing with defamation, copyright, obscenity, incitement, official secrecy, contempt of court and parliament, censorship and consumer protection all qualify what can be expressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These laws recognise the need to legislate where words can cause serious economic damage, prejudice a fair trial or unfairly damage a person's reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this bill, free speech has been balanced against the rights of Australians to live free of fear and racial harassment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely the promotion of racial hatred and its inevitable link to violence is as damaging to our community as issuing a misleading prospectus, or breaching the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill places no new limits on genuine public debate. Australians must be free to speak their minds, to criticise actions and policies of others and to share a joke. The bill does not prohibit people from expressing ideas or having beliefs, no matter how unpopular the views may be to many other people. The law has no application to private conversations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nothing which is said or done reasonably and in good faith in the course of any statement, publication, discussion or debate made or held for an academic, artist, or scientific purpose, or any other purpose in the public interest will be prohibited by the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worthy of note that New South Wales has had similar legislation for five years and yet no one has seriously argued that free speech has been curtailed there. Nor has it been unduly limited in other Australian jurisdictions where similar legislation exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But perhaps most noteworthy are the experiences in other liberal democracies throughout the world that ban racial hatred and violence. Free speech is a constitutional right in Canada and many European countries, yet the highest courts in these countries have held provisions which ban racist hatred and violence in public to be reasonable and necessary. In fact, in 1989 the Canadian Supreme Court upheld Canada's anti-hate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently the Australian High Court has established the existence within the Constitution of an implied guarantee of free expression. The High Court decisions have been closely examined and the government is fully convinced that the bill does not infringe on the principles developed by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly then, while these are important issues, the Commonwealth parliament is not the first Australian legislature to grapple with them. Criminal laws dealing with the incitement of racial hatred operate in New South Wales, Western Australia, Queensland and the Australian Capital Territory. Civil provisions are also in place in each of these jurisdictions except Western Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New Zealand has had laws of this nature since 1971. Along with Canada, Great Britain and a number of the States of the United States also have specific laws on racial hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle of legislating to deal with racial hatred has for sometime enjoyed the support of the leadership of the Federal Liberal Party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The former Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in a address to the Zionist Federation in May 1992, said national anti-vilification legislation would be a worthwhile initiative in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Coalition's commitment to such legislation was reconfirmed with the release of the Liberal and National Parties 1993 Fightback! Law and Justice Policy by the then-Shadow Attorney-General and now the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the Member for Higgins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fightback! policy document stated unequivocally that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inciting fear or damage to people or their property on racial grounds should be prohibited</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Costello reaffirmed this commitment in a letter dated 8 February 1993 to Mr Mark Leibler which said of the 1992 draft legislation:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">We accept the principles underlying the first part of the bill, which is designed to prevent intentionally stirring up racial hatred fear of violence or injury to person or property.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As recently as May this year the Coalition again publicly endorsed the need for such legislation when its then spokesperson on these matters, the Member for Tangney, Daryl Williams, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition recognises the need for the legislation and, in principle, we accept that legislation should provide criminal sanctions for racial violence and hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current Leader of the Opposition has also publicly recognised the need for racial hatred legislation and committed himself to supporting such action by this parliament. Only four months ago, in a wide ranging interview reported in the Australian Jewish News, Mr Downer said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where there is incitement to violence or to damaging property on the basis of race, then there is no question that should be a criminal offence. You obviously have to find a balance between free speech, on one hand, and ensuring that there isn't incitement to racial vilification in our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However the Opposition is not supporting this bill. It has been advanced that the bill restricts freedom of speech and that a model based on the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act 1977 would allay Opposition concerns.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, let me now detail the provisions of the bill and where appropriate make comparisons with the NSW legislation. I believe that a fair assessment is that while the NSW law is a perfectly workable model, the bill overcomes some deficiencies in the NSW Act and is consistent with the Commonwealth's own human rights regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In outline, the bill amends the Crimes Act 1914 to provide for three criminal offences and amends the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 to provide for a civil prohibition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The criminal provisions do not attempt to replicate the general criminal law which deals with physical violence and the damage to property. Rather the provisions centre on the precursors of actual violence; that is, the incitement of racial hatred and threats made to a person or persons or property because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill seeks to close a gap in the operation of current laws by protecting people confronted by situations likely to lead to fear and racist violence. The three criminal provisions to be inserted in the Crimes Act 1914 are set out in clause 4 of the bill. The first 2 offences deal respectively with threats, done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin, against people and property, while the third prohibits acts done, otherwise than in private, with the intention of inciting racial hatred. I shall speak about each provision in turn.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed section 58 is quite simple in its terms&mdash;it creates an offence which requires a person to threaten another because of their race, colour or national or ethnic origin. While the general law affords protection where a person is the subject to physical threat, proposed section 58 will expressly cover such a person where the basis of the threat is the person's race, colour or national or ethnic origin. Perhaps more significantly, it will also afford protection throughout Australia in cases where there is no single person threatened, but a group of people identifiable by their race.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This offence of threatening physical harm to people is based on an assault-type provision (although it does not cover actual battery). The concept of threatening physical harm has been considered judicially on many occasions, and requires that `the person to whom violence is offered, to whom the threat is made, must . . . believe that violence is to be feared': McNamara [1954] VLR 137 at 138.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed section 59 is similar, except that it is directed at cases where a person's property, rather than their own physical safety, is threatened with damage or destruction. Given the serious nature of the conduct to be dealt with by proposed sections 58 and 59, I believe that there is a strong case for including these provisions in the Commonwealth's criminal law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Proposed section 60 creates a criminal offence in relation to the intentional incitement of racial hatred. There are four elements of the offence:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) the offence will only arise in relation to an act done otherwise than in private (note that proposed section 60(2) provides a definition of what acts are taken not to be done in private);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2) such an act must be done with an intention to incite racial hatred (that is, the offence contains a subjective test);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the act must be done because of race, colour or national or ethnic origin; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the act must be one which is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred (that is, the offence contains an objective test).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The term `incitement' is to be regarded as referring to a conscious and motivated act&mdash;hence the inclusion of a subjective test as an element of the offence. The travaux preparatoires  to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination refer to `incitement' in the sense of provocation. The travaux also refer to `provocation to violence' against any race or group of persons of another colour or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The travaux do not define `racial hatred' but it may be inferred by analogy to Article 1 of the Convention that the term `racial hatred' simply means hatred based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin. Thus, the United Kingdom Public Order Act 1986 states that `racial hatred' means hatred against a group of persons defined by reference to colour, race, nationality (including citizenship) or ethnic or national origins. As used in proposed section 60, `hatred' carries its ordinary meaning indicating intense dislike or enmity. It is instructive to compare the use of `hatred' in this bill with section 20D of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Act, which refers also to inciting `serious contempt for', or `severe ridicule of', a person or group. This seems to indicate that that Act's use of the terms `incitement of', `serious contempt' or `severe ridicule' makes that Act in some ways broader in scope than the bill which uses the term `incitement to racial hatred'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In considering whether a particular act, which in other respects satisfies the various elements of the offence in proposed section 60, `is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to incite racial hatred', a court would have to have regard to all the circumstances surrounding the case to determine whether that objective test has been satisfied. Section 20D of the New South Wales Act specifies two things to be included in the means used to incite, namely, where a person threatens physical harm to a person or property, or incites others to so threaten. In this bill, such activity is dealt with by proposed sections 58 and 59. However, it should be noted that if those threats do not incite hatred either because there is no third party present or that person is not incited to hate, there can be no offence under section 20D of the New South Wales Act. This is a serious shortcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among other things, proposed section 60 would deal with those cases where a person's acts are reasonably likely to incite, against persons of a particular race, colour or national or ethnic origin, intense racial enmity of a kind which is likely to lead to physical harm to persons of that group or damage or destruction of their property. In other words, a person does not necessarily need to actually threaten physical harm to persons or property to commit an offence against section 60.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It needs to be recognised that racial hatred does not exist in a vacuum or for the intellectual satisfaction of those feeling it. Racial hatred provides a climate in which people of a particular race or ethnic origin live in fear and in which discrimination can thrive. It provides the climate in which violence may take place. It is of itself a threat to the well-being of the whole community as well as to individuals or groups in the community. It needs to be confronted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The kind of behaviour that proposed section 60 is designed to address has been made the subject of criminal sanctions in similar legal and social systems. I refer senators to section 319(2) of the Canadian Criminal Code; section 63 of the Human Rights Act of New Zealand; and section 18 of the United Kingdom Public Order Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a maximum penalty of 2 years' imprisonment for the offence in proposed section 58 of threatening to harm a person while the offences in proposed sections 59 and 60 of threatening to damage property and incitement to racial hatred, respectively, carry a maximum penalty of 1 year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I should explain that imprisonment is by no means the only sentencing option available to a court where a person is found guilty of one of these three offences. Where a person is found guilty of any Commonwealth offence, including those which the bill creates, the starting point for a court is found in section 16A of the Crimes Act 1914, which sets out the matters a court must have regard to when sentencing and requires the court to impose a sentence that is `appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence'. To determine the most appropriate sentence, a court is provided with a full range of options, such as fines, bonds or community service orders in additional to imprisonment. For example, section 4B of the Crimes Act provides a mechanism by means of which a term of imprisonment can be converted into a fine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth legislation will be amended following enactment of the bill to provide that where a person or corporation is convicted of a criminal offence under the bill as enacted, that person or corporation will not be eligible to receive a government grant or subsidy. For example, a company convicted of disseminating literature which was found by the court to be reasonably likely to incite racial hatred would not be eligible to receive an export market development grant from the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So, in essence, the difference between the Commonwealth bill and the NSW Anti-Discrimination Act in criminal matters turns on the offence of the incitement of racial hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW law does not criminalise as such the making of a threat on the grounds of race, but rather covers threats only where they are means by which racial hatred is incited. In contrast, this bill provides that the making of threats on racial grounds is an offence of itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Threats may often be associated with the incitement of racial hatred. However in the government's view, a threat to violence is of sufficient concern to be a specific criminal offence even when it is not a factor in the incitement of racial hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for a civil regime by the amendment of the Racial Discrimination Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 18C will be inserted in the Act to make it unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) The act is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or group of people; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) The act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of initial points need to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the provision is civil and not criminal in effect. That is, the process will be initiated by the victim of alleged unlawful behaviour via a complaint to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and not by police investigations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, like all complaints under Commonwealth human rights laws, the Commission will endeavour to resolve the matter by private and confidential conciliation. Only if conciliation cannot resolve the matter is there a public hearing and a determination by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission can immediately dismiss frivolous or vexatious complaints.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The format of the civil provision is similar to the model used in other Commonwealth human rights legislation such as the Sex Discrimination Act. It is&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">based upon the availability of a remedy in specified circumstances,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">judged against the objective criteria of what is reasonably likely in all the circumstances to give rise to a valid complaint, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">limited and targeted through the use of exemptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement that the behaviour complained about should `offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate' is the same as that used to establish sexual harassment in the Sex Discrimination Act. The Commission is familiar with the scope of such language and has applied it in a way that deals with serious incidents only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill requires an objective test to be applied by the Commission so that community standards to behaviour rather than the subjective views of the complainant are taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemptions are broad and cover acts done</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the performance, exhibition or distribution of an artistic work,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in the course of discussion or debate for an academic, artistic or scientific purpose or other purpose in the public interest, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in making or publishing a report or comment on a matter in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under proposed section 18E an employer may be vicariously liable for the unlawful acts of an employee. However the employer has a complete defence if it is established he or she took all reasonable steps to prevent the employee from doing the unlawful act. This provision is in terms similar to section 106 of the Sex Discrimination Act and section 18A of the Racial Discrimination Act. The terms of section 123 of the Disability Discrimination Act achieve the same result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NSW Anti-Discrimination Act also contains, in section 20C, a civil prohibition of the incitement of hatred towards, serious contempt for, or severe ridicule of a person or group on the ground of race.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provision is likewise qualified by exemptions and vicarious liability was extended to employers by an amendment to the Act this year. The difference between the Commonwealth and NSW provisions turn on the description of the conduct giving rise to a potential complaint and the extent of the exceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is arguable whether these differences would greatly alter the work of either the Commonwealth or NSW human rights bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the government's view, this bill is to be preferred over other models because it represents the sum of experiences in these jurisdictions. There are procedural defects in the NSW legislation and the allied system of administration required by the law, particularly the procedure for referring civil complaints to the Director of Public Prosecution without the benefit of any criminal investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth bill reflects the input of public comment on the 1992 draft bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is simpler, more focused and easier to administer. It targets circumstances which are preliminary to violence. It does not attempt to replicate laws dealing with actual violence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has a clear distinction between civil and criminal prohibitions. It fills a gap in our laws and enhances the social compact which underpins racial harmony in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has a very proud record of protecting and promoting human rights. This parliament, as it should have, has led the nation in legislating to protect and enhance all Australians human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislative regime, including the Racial Discrimination Act, Sex Discrimination Act, Disability Discrimination Act passed by this parliament are a clear demonstration Australia's commitment to basic human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are fortunate in that Australia has a significant degree of social cohesion and racial harmony.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is an appropriate and measured response to closing the identified gap in the legal protection of all Australians from extreme racist behaviour. It strikes a balance between the right of free speech and the other rights and interests of Australia and Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It provides a safety net for racial harmony in Australia and sends a clear warning to those who might attack the principle of tolerance. And importantly this bill provides Australians who are the victims of racial hatred or violence with protection.</PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of these amendments is to provide 100 per cent discount for farm assets under the Austudy assets test. For the past four years, the Australian Democrats have been moving amendments to exempt the family farm from the assets test and for the past four years we have received little support from the Liberal, National or Labor parties. As we know, the government's drought package relaxed the assets test for farmers in exceptional drought areas. The Democrats, however, believe that the assets test is currently discriminating against all farmers and has done so for many years. Children from farming families deserve and have a right to receive the same level of government encouragement and support to continue their studies that city children enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time I moved an amendment of this sort, it was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. That committee received well over 100 submissions and each and every one of those&mdash;with the exception of the submission from the Department of Social Security&mdash;spoke of the inequity in the assets test as it impacts on farm families. One only needs to see that the average value of a broadacre farm is around $900,000 to realise how this inequity arises. That $900,000 in assets is simply what is needed to have some semblance of long-term viability in farming these days. It does not include any luxury items or any personal assets, it just includes basic farm business assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the level of assets in 1992-93, Australia's broadacre farmers returned an average loss of around $17,500 for the year. They are expected to show a loss of around $6,000 in 1993-94. So, we have families who are losing substantial amounts of money but who are not able to access the majority of government payments. On top of that is the fact that, after we add up the transport, boarding and other costs, rural parents have to pay around $7,000 per annum more than their city counterparts to educate their children. The Democrats amendment not only recognises that farmers are often asset rich but income poor but also acknowledges that those farm assets are business assets and, as such, should not be included in the Austudy assets test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing, I will read to the Senate a couple of comments on the issue that have been made recently by members of the Liberal and National Party coalition. Firstly, when debating this bill in House of Representatives, the opposition's previous shadow minister for schools, Mr Miles, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems a gross injustice that properties or farms are included under the Austudy assets test . . .  . . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is one of the greatest anomalies and inequities of the Austudy system and, undoubtedly, it disadvantages rural students.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Miles is quite correct. Secondly, in a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Murray Pioneer</EMPHASIS>, Senator Ferguson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coalition is genuinely concerned about the impact Austudy asset tests have on rural families endeavouring to further their children's education. Undoubtedly, assets tests for such families can be discriminatory, as many of them have significant farm business assets but relatively low to negative incomes.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ferguson went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Liberal Party has had a long and proud history of upholding the rights of rural people and of condemning the discrimination they often face from Labor policies that appear to favour city dwellers.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, Senator Ferguson is quite right. I can only assume from the sentiments very clearly expressed in those quotes that the Liberal and National parties are going to support my amendment. The amendment reflects the policy of the National Farmers Federation, and I am sure that it reflects the wishes of every farming family in Australia. Regardless of what might happen in subsequent amendments, I urge the Senate to support this amendment to provide a 100 per cent discount on farm assets under the Austudy assets test. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am astonished to hear what the Australian Democrats are seeking to do today, because it is inconsistent with the position that they have advocated previously. And it seems to me to be inconsistent with the amendment that they had previously circulated in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to confess at the outset that I am a little at a loss, because Senator Gibson, who had the conduct of this matter on our behalf, is on parliamentary business in New Zealand. He had left the matter in the capable hands of Senator Tierney, who has been caught in Newcastle as a result of the transport workers' industrial action. If the government would get its industrial relations in order, we might be better equipped in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the position which the Australian Democrats had put on a previous occasion&mdash;and, as I understand it, amendments had been circulated in the name of Senator Bell&mdash;was the position that we had supported. That position is that if a farmer qualifies for a health care card because of very low income, he or she should be exempt from the assets test for the purpose of Austudy for his or her children. We ourselves have previously adopted that position in this chamber&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator Teague</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And we've been successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had it carried. We have supported it because it seems logical and sensible in the current circumstances. There is a tragedy in rural Australia at the moment; so many Australian farmers have found their income has been reduced to negligible levels&mdash;in some instances to a nil level&mdash;as a result of prolonged drought. I guess we have all heard of tragic circumstances where, in previously good, productive areas of Australia, there has not been effective rain for four years. So, in effect, farmers have had no real income for that incredibly long period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The education of the farmers' children is a matter of national importance. As I have travelled around educational establishments in rural Australia, I have found that there is a very deep concern that the children of farmers are suffering. When I recently went to the university at Armidale, I was told that students simply were not attending classes. When I asked why, I was told that they could no longer afford the fuel to get themselves to the university for lectures. This is a national tragedy and it has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know the unsatisfactory aspects of the drought response of the government. But that is just part of the issue. Another part of it is how we look at supporting the education of rural children in this very difficult situation. As I have said, it seemed to us that, if because of very low income farmers qualify for a health card, an assets test should not be applied to those farmers in calculating whether or not they receive Austudy support for the education of their children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That position, as I recall it, was supported by the government&mdash;in fact, the government indicated publicly that it would support it. The government instructed its bureaucrats to prepare the forms, told rural Australia that this would be its position, that it would give support to rural children in this way, and then reneged on that promise. What we have sought to do in this chamber is hold the government to that promise. Whenever we have had the opportunity, we have moved an amendment of this sort. As Senator Teague interjected, we have had support for it previously from the Australian Democrats. We have therefore had the numbers and the amendment has been carried. But, regrettably, despite the pressure that has been applied to the government, it has not positively responded and has not been prepared to address the needs of rural children in this way. In circumstances where the Australian Democrats seem to have now abandoned this&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Bell" NAMEID="7U4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator Bell</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You can only move one at a time.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very confusing situation. Senator Woodley seems to have come in with a new approach today. I do not know who is speaking for the Australian Democrats on this matter today. I guess they will have the opportunity to seek to clarify their position, but it looks as though there is a Queensland push that has come down and is overriding the Tasmanian position, or perhaps there is another explanation. Unfortunately, all they are really doing is leaving a very confusing environment for the Australian rural community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will stand by the position that we have advocated and received support for before. Presuming the Australian Democrats are now no longer going to move the amendment that Senator Bell previously circulated, at an appropriate time, when this particular amendment before the committee has been dealt with, we will move an amendment that says that where farmers qualify for a health card the assets test should not apply for Austudy calculations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At an appropriate time in this committee debate we will also seek to make a further amendment in relation to exceptional circumstances. This will apply to some farmers. It is hard to see that, if they do not qualify for the health card, they will not fit within exceptional circumstances. Senator Boswell might clarify that. Nevertheless, it does seem to us that, as well as the exceptional circumstances that currently exist within rural Australia, a further exemption should apply to families as defined by regulation 13(1)(a) of the Austudy regulations. When families are in exceptional circumstances the minister should be able to exempt them from the other requirements for Austudy. They should also be supported in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, if rural families can come under one of the two tests&mdash;either they are getting a health card because of low income or they are under the exceptional circumstance provisions&mdash;they should be exempted from the other Austudy restrictions and the community should be prepared to support them in the education of their children during this period of great difficulty in rural Australia. With both of those amendments being carried, we believe that we will be supporting Australian rural children in an appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will also be waiting anxiously for a Senate committee report on the education of rural children, the application of assets tests and other such matters. It would be very helpful for the chamber to be further informed of this debate. I understand that report is likely to be put down within the next couple of weeks. If so, that will be a very helpful contribution to this debate in the future. I am sure we are going to have a debate in the future because the government is showing no signs at all of positively responding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley's contribution this morning seems to me to create an inequitable situation between small business in rural Australia and those actually farming in rural Australia. Both are suffering at the moment, so why withdraw certain of the assets of one group and not of the other group? Small business, one of the service industries in rural Australia, is a further element of the tragedy of the drought that has been given insufficient consideration or care by government in addressing this matter of great concern. It seems to have been completely overlooked by the Australian Democrats in their contribution this morning. Senator Woodley might explain to the chamber why he has decided to overlook small business and to draw further inequities between those who are on the land and those who are, hopefully, trying to draw income from servicing those on the land. Surely their children are being as much affected and deserve as much attention and support as the children of those directly earning their income from the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment on the run by Senator Woodley to hopefully gain a little further rural support for the Australian Democrats, who are proving themselves to be totally ineffective representatives of these communities, has been drawn up in a way that results in inequities and inconsistencies. I guess that demonstrates the real motive of the amendment, and that is to try to win points rather than address the needs of rural Australia in a considered and sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe the case has been made out for Senator Woodley's amendment&mdash;from what I have heard so far anyway in this debate. I urge the Australian Democrats to stand by their previous position. We know that we will have the numbers and can put a bit of pressure on the government to respond positively, that is, to support the health care amendments and also our suggested amendments on exceptional circumstances. Then at least we will be doing something positive for rural Australia today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a Senate inquiry now&mdash;I think Senator Woodley is on the inquiry&mdash;that is investigating Austudy. It will bring down its recommendations in a couple of weeks. That is the time we should be looking at this amendment. Maybe that is the way to go; I do not know. Maybe that is what the Senate inquiry will establish. But, until the report of that inquiry does come down, the amendment that we have moved is a substantial amendment that will not only catch farmers who are being affected by the drought&mdash;and the 1,900 woolgrowers in exceptional circumstances&mdash;but also pick up all those small businesses that are suffering as a consequence of the lack of income of farmers. The small businesses in the towns that service farmers are probably suffering just as much, or even more in some cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The health card amendment that has been proposed by the Liberal and National parties will pick up all the farmers Senator Woodley has mentioned. Anyone on an income under $23,000 a year&mdash;and there are not too many people in rural Australia, certainly in western rural Australia, at the moment who are making that sort of money&mdash;will get picked up. The businesses in the major towns that are servicing rural Australia will also be able to access Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a good amendment because out in the community it is fair. It does not divide the community; it gives all people the same opportunities. It is based on need and on income. Everyone whose income is below a certain figure&mdash;and we acknowledge that there is very little positive income out there; it is mostly zero income or even negative income&mdash;will get picked up whether they are a rural producer or a small business. That has some sort of equity about it.

So all farmers with a low income, a negative income or a minus income will be able to access Austudy, and so will the small businesses in rural Australia that are dependent on the farmers. Because the farmers are not spending, the small businesses are not receiving sales and so they are being adversely affected. For the time being this is quite an acceptable amendment. </PARA>

I cannot be in two places at one time. That is why I object, quite frankly, to these committees sitting at the same time as the Senate is sitting. This amendment is of great importance to the whole of Australia. It is important to farmers because they are, in effect, the backbone of this country in many cases.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not the first time we have tried to reform Austudy in this way.</PARA>

I could quote from past, well-meaning speeches and press releases from the coalition&mdash;and I am sure Senator Kemp will be interested in this. One was in 1991 by the then shadow minister, Dr David Kemp.</PARA>
<PARA>I said that he claimed&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Families with little or no real income are being excluded by the assets test from Austudy and as a result are having to withdraw their children from education.</PARA>
<PARA>We heard a repeat of that. There were crocodile tears from the opposition. Senator Hill went on with some story about how he went to Armidale and was impressed by the fact that people were no longer contributing or taking part in education because they could not afford the trip to Armidale. Having been impressed by that, he was moved to see that there was a need for reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a need for reform for several years, and we have been attempting to do it.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I foreshadow that we will move an amendment to this bill which will remove the tools of trade from the assets test for rural families. We will do that in the committee stage.</PARA>
<PARA>Here it is. It is in front of us. It has been foreshadowed. It was not made on the run. It was consistent with what we have been doing for four years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully support the summary of my colleague Senator Hill of the opposition's position on the Student Assistance (Budget Matters) Amendment Bill and on this amendment moved by Senator Woodley. It is a fact that the words of Senator Woodley's amendment have not been debated in the chamber before. I concede to Senator Bell, who has made some very substantial contributions on education matters over these last four years, that there have been intimations about the best way to meet the needs of children in the bush.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that we have all debated various forms of words that might be the best solution to gain equity and justice for rural families, especially those in the dire straits of this continuing drought. The Liberal and National parties will not allow anyone to hold a candle to us for the great light that we want to give to the need for justice for rural families. That is why we have been consistently arguing that there should be the same test, the same concession, for student allowances, which is eligibility for the health care card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is that position that the opposition will adopt as soon as this amendment is disposed of. Senator Hill has circulated the opposition's amendment, which is in the same form as the amendment that I moved on behalf of the opposition six months ago and which the Democrats happily supported. We placed it within the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994, which was then in front of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to repeat the comprehensive summary on this matter that was given by Senator Hill. However, I want to add one additional argument as to why the chamber should adopt the same position on this bill as the one we had six months ago on the Student Assistance Amendment Bill 1994. The House of Representatives&mdash;that is, the government, because it has a majority there&mdash;put to the parliament six months ago an amendment to the Student Assistance Act that made a number of improvements to student assistance arrangements. In addition to those improvements, which we all supported, the opposition moved an additional motion whereby families that are eligible for the health card would be freed of an assets test so that their children and other family members could gain student assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the Senate's position. But when this measly government&mdash;this Labor Party&mdash;got that bill back in the House of Representatives, with the whole bill agreed to by the Senate but with a Senate amendment in addition, the measly minister in the House of Representatives said, `We will not proceed with this bill any further.' So it remains just lying on the table in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the House of Representatives understood the arguments put in the Senate for assistance to rural families being on the basis of need, as tested by eligibility for the health card, the minister would pick up the bill from last June, proceed with it and get all the benefits that were in the government's original bill in addition to this widely accepted standard for helping rural families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put this argument to the chamber: now that we have another piece of legislation related to student assistance, it is appropriate that we put the same amendment. If the government again takes the measly route of rejecting all of these measures, it will then be stacking up two bills that we all agree with. We are adding the same amendment. Will the government come back with a third bill for student assistance matters so that we will put the same amendment on it? The government will have piling higher and higher a series of bills which the parliament accepts. The Senate, by a clear majority, wants rural families assisted on an equitable and comprehensive basis that does not divide farmers from small business operators. It wants to go about this on the basis of an accepted test, which is eligibility for the health card. So I put it to this committee that the appropriate way forward is for us to support Senator Hill's amendment, which relates to the health card test, and not Senator Woodley's amendment, which is now before us. </PARA>

It will not help the police, the teachers, the meatworkers, the council employees, or the barman at the bowls club at Bourke. Let me tell the coalition that all of those people are greatly affected by the drought that we find in Australia at the moment. As a matter of fact, at the drought inquiry of the Senate committee on rural and regional affairs, which inquired into this matter in 1992, it was the barman at the bowls club in Bourke who told me how greatly the drought did affect the people in the rural communities. </PARA>

It will be received in exactly the same way. Let us not be petty about who does in fact move this amendment. Let us not be petty about that and try to score points.

There are opportunities for small businesses which do not receive any income at all to be covered by the health care card.

I know that Senator Teague over there is fighting very hard with Senator Chapman in South Australia for the rural vote, and this sort of thing would be useful out there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is another matter which has been adjourned for some time. As I recall, the last contribution was from the government justifying why the changes were needed to introduce a pro rata arrangement for the recovery of HECS loans. At the time, the argument was well rehearsed. We had been going through a considerable amount of rhetoric in rehearsing that and not reaching any conclusions. I saw this as yet another government alteration&mdash;I suppose that is a polite word for it&mdash;to that which had been established as the way of operating; in other words, the deal that had been agreed to by students and the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen quite a lengthy progression of these changes over the past few years. There have been changes made to the threshold at which the students would be expected to begin repaying the amount of HECS deferred debt. That reduction was initiated, we are told, because those naughty students had gone and got themselves unemployed after they had completed their tertiary studies: it was all their fault that they were not repaying the government. That little myth was peddled for a while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had a change which involved an increase in the rate of repayment. The rates of repayment were altered up one per cent all round. So a recent graduate who had just managed to cross the threshold would begin repaying his debt&mdash;not at the rate of one per cent&mdash;at the rate of two per cent. This is an additional tax. It means that those graduates who were paying two per cent would be paying three per cent and those who were paying three per cent would be paying four per cent, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That could be seen as a minimal change affecting only those who are privileged enough to have employment. Even that alteration of the goalposts was not seen as bringing in enough of this extraordinary amount of money that the government was carrying over as debt. It was portrayed in the media for a time as bad debt. There was a bit of a run given to the impression that somehow these students were welshing on their agreement by not paying back the money that they owed quickly enough. I think whoever perpetuated that fallacy fairly quickly saw the unfairness of it because the media did not really pick that up. Those who thought about the matter for more than five seconds recognised that it was the fault of those who were running the country that these young people were unable to get employment and therefore were unable to reach the salary threshold to begin repaying. So that one was dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now have this latest proposition: instead of waiting until the end of the first year in which the taxable income passes the new lower threshold, instead of waiting for the end of the first year in which that taxable income can be assessed, a few assumptions are made. This is where I start to get alarmed. When governments make assumptions, people suffer. The assumption made here is that, if a person is in receipt of a weekly amount which, if multiplied out through the year, would bring him or her up to a certain amount per year and therefore over the threshold, the repayment can begin that week. The first PAYE tax deduction will include a contribution for the repayment of the HECS debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement is made&mdash;and logically; I do not disagree with anybody's right to make it&mdash;`Well, if they are at that income level, they ought to be repaying it.' That might be logical and it might be so, but it was not part of the deal. It was not part of the agreement which the students originally entered into. Because it was not part of the deal, changing the deal halfway through the game is something which most three-year-olds can detect as being unfair. You should try playing a game of catch with a three-year-old and saying, halfway through, `You've got to stand on your head first.' The three-year-old will soon tell you that that is an unfair change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who have devised this new change have been away from the real world for just a little too long. They have been away from dealing with people who are entering into agreements on the basis of what their real expectations are in the real world in terms of their own commitments, why they make them, and why they decide that something is a fair enough situation to get into. The fact that that has changed is the basic reason why this is unfair. A number of amendments and alterations can be made to this original concept, but there is nothing that can be done that can alter the basic unfairness of this attitude which the government has brought to this agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some information provided to me on this matter by the government's advisers. I must say I was impressed with some of the answers that were given to me in terms of the way in which things are calculated and how it all pans out. It seems to be not all that unfair when the calculations are taken into account. But it did seem to me that, in a piece of legislation like this, it would be appropriate to include some fairly basic definitions. One of the definitions that seemed to me to be lacking was a definition of the cessation of full-time study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a situation where certain things are to be applied to people upon the cessation of full-time study, and yet nobody has taken the trouble to work out exactly when that is. There is a taxation definition. There is an Austudy definition. The two are not necessarily compatible, and here we have a proposition to establish a third situation where the cessation of full-time study is to be taken into account. I would have thought that should be reasonably easy to determine. It is something that is fundamental to the operation of the proposition we have before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also not impressed by the fact that the liability for complying with this is still somewhat vague. I remember a previous debate, which was similar to this in that it considered the same philosophy, in which Senator Panizza and I were in some sort of agreement&mdash;surprisingly not an unusual situation. Senator Panizza pointed out that, from an employer's perspective, some of the questions were a little difficult to answer. An employer who had the responsibility of dealing with the PAYE section of people's income had to take at face value whatever students said about their HECS liability and yet was liable, in the long run, to accurately deal with the situation as far as the tax office was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As yet, I cannot see that this has been clarified sufficiently to enable employers to be able to tackle the area with any degree of confidence. I will admit that my first concerns about the extra complications are not as well founded as I thought they might have been because, in this day of computers and adjustments and the individual circumstances which almost all employees find themselves in, the onus on the employer to alter things and make changes to the payment schedules is not such a great onus. It is not as much of a problem as I first thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the other problem remains. I recall the previous piece of legislation we discussed which affected this. At first the representatives of students had been opposed to this. Then they changed their minds and informed the coalition that they had changed their minds and had found that it was a wonderful advantage and should be implemented as soon as possible. But in the interim, again, I think there is considerable disquiet. I suggest that there is no degree of unanimity in the student bodies that represent students in Australia. I suggest also that not only student bodies but also graduate bodies should be consulted here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry, the minister at the table at the moment representing the government, would be aware that the alumni group of the University of Tasmania would be a far more representative body to be consulted on this than is the union of students, whose members are not directly affected at all because they are yet to graduate and be in that situation. I see no evidence that such bodies have been consulted. Those bodies from that area that I have consulted on this have been opposed to the concept of changing the rules yet again while the game is in progress and of affecting people who made arrangements under different circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to my original point: there is nothing the government can do to remove the basic unfairness of the proposition that we have here. We are very doubtful about this. We remain to be convinced that it is in the best interests of those whom it most affects. It may be in the best interests of the government to get some more money back. But to portray that money as bad debt which is recoverable from students at a higher rate is a wrong portrayal; it is a misleading portrayal; and, I suggest, it is even a dishonest portrayal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibility for repaying the HECS debt lies with students. But they are obliged to repay it only when they are in employment which has a taxable income per year above the threshold limit. The definition of when the liability would be reached and when the liability should occur is crucial in the understanding of fairness. A great number of people will be directly affected by this. Their net income may well be above the threshold limit, but their taxable income, for all sorts of reasons, may be considerably below it. Those people will be at a great disadvantage in losing access to cash money for a considerable part of the year and will be greatly disadvantaged by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of people who may want to make a contribution per week to lessen the opportunity for them to be hit with a bulk repayment at the end of the taxable year is easily dismissed by the opportunity within the present situation for those people who are concerned by it to make fortnightly payments in expectation that they will reach the initial threshold and get rid of their HECS debt as soon as they like. I suggest that those people are fewer in number than those who will be greatly disadvantaged by having less cash at the beginning of a working career which is perhaps uncertain and may involve only short periods of employment, other periods of employment and other periods of unemployment that are beyond their capacity to predict. During all that time, whenever their fortnightly income is pro rata above the deemed threshold, they are penalised, so they have less money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all the complications that there are about whether somebody is employed, whether there is a waiting period or a qualifying period to receive the jobsearch allowance or to be involved in the new proposals of youth training initiatives, I can see people having a short time when they may have an income that is above the threshold. That money will be removed from their pay packet. They will then go on to some other scheme or be involved in a different arrangement. These problems are legion and real. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that those who devised this proposition have been away from that sort of concern for far too long. They are more concerned about finding ways to rearrange things in order to get more money back into the government's coffers. While it may seem logical on paper, this way is unfair in reality. We are greatly concerned about it. </PARA>

The Greens have no problem with the minor amendments to the act but are committed to opposing clause 12 and the government's intention to collect a faster repayment of HECS through charging pro rata HECS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students who have just finished university do not find work straightaway. They keep on with the casual work that got them through university, which could be consistent work or a couple of months work at relatively high pay that gives them enough savings to get through the semester. When students do find work, because of the nature of the employment market it is rare to land into a full-time job. Often there are periods doing short-term contract work, such as relief work, which can be infrequent, to gain experience. There are students who opt for self-employment or consulting work, which can be infrequent, short term and have large income swings, while waiting for more stable work opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this amendment the government is attempting to capitalise on the sporadic work opportunities of those in their first year of work after leaving university. In any one week, if their income is over $504 before tax they will lose three per cent of that to HECS payment. In a scenario of the minimum impact of this change, this would mean taking $15 out of a wage of $400&mdash;and that may not be consistent. Across the board this takes an extra $5 million out of the pockets of new graduates, the amount the government hopes to earn from this amendment. This comes at a time when graduate incomes have fallen and student debt is increasing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not made these changes in isolation. The government has a recent history of tightening the noose around students' necks through HECS payments. In the last two budgets, students have been commanded to repay HECS at faster and higher rates. At the same time, they now have Austudy debts of up to $11,000 extra to pay off, on top of their HECS debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Graduate incomes are also at their lowest level in 20 years. Statistics released by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia on 4 October this year showed that annual graduate starting salaries had dropped by $200 in 1992 and 1993 despite a rise three times that for average earnings in the community over the same period. Women also earn 90 per cent of the wages of fellow male university graduates and graduates earn 80 per cent of that which other workers earn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As starting salaries slip below average weekly earnings, adding up to $26,500 per year, and as the job market becomes harder and harder to crack, the government is realising that it will have to continually put pressure on students to pay the money back at higher rates while they earn less. The government realises that many former students will never pay off their debts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens are opposed to increasing HECS any further, as the government is probably hoping to do in next year's budget, and has flagged as much in the latest recommendations of the recent DEET report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Resources allocation in higher education</EMPHASIS>. This bill is a shoddy attempt to claw back small amounts of money from students who are suffering poverty under Austudy, debt for a greater part of their working lives, a dwindling number of jobs, less and less public funding of their higher education institutions and a poorer quality of education. The government should get its priorities right and start looking at the real issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill is to bring forward repayment of the HECS liability and introduce a pro rata payment threshold for students who leave full-time education for the first time. The changes announced in the last budget will take effect from 1 January 1995. This arrangement is effectively a PAYE tax system being applied to the repayment of the HECS debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The HECS liability is now to be paid each week from the pay packet. As Senator Hill pointed out in the debate on this bill the last time the Senate met, we support some of the provisions of this bill; however, we oppose the attempt to introduce pro rata payments for HECS. We will oppose this measure because we believe it is inequitable and unfair and it contains a number of unexplained anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe this new attempt could be the first of many changes by Labor to try to introduce pro rata payments for all students across the board. As I indicated earlier, there are some provisions of the bill that we will not oppose: for example, amendments removing the restriction on the number of units for which eligible clients under the open learning deferred payments scheme may defer payment in the first semester of study. We will support an amendment to increase the maximum level of grant funding available under certain provisions of the act to reflect the revised amount available following verification of relevant HECS information. We will support an amendment to transfer funds to the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. We will also support the minor changes in the definition of an overseas student to ensure that members of foreign armed services studying in Australia pay full fees rather than HECS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are supporting quite a number of changes in this bill. However, as I mentioned earlier, we have major concerns about the introduction of pro rata payments. It is just one more step in an evolving pattern of this government scrambling around for more and more money in order to fund its inadequately funded higher education system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This arrangement started originally with an administration charge of a few hundred dollars. We now have HECS charges of $2,400 each year. At the moment, as a result of this HECS measure which has been in place for several years, the community has an outstanding liability to the government of $2 billion, and the Department of Finance is pretty desperate to claw this money in. That is the foundation of the major part of this bill to which the coalition objects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe the pro rata payment and PAYE approach is just a crude attempt to get this money in at all costs. It denies many students equity and fairness. It provides a double whammy for students: they get the HECS liability and then the ground rules concerning the timing of the prepayment are changed in order to suit this ALP government. Students and prospective students entering higher education are fed up with the constant changes to their liability. The government keeps changing the rules on the run. Some students have started a course under one set of rules and, during that course, have seen those rules change several times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This creates fear in students because their commitments might be altered overnight and therefore the debt they have to pay at the end could change. Their liability, on which they are working out their financial affairs over the years they are at university, can change as well, affecting their standard of living. As we know, many students teeter on the brink of poverty and even a small change to the rules, such as that which the government is indicating, can affect them greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many students are in the position where they will earn money over a Christmas vacation. This will boost their income and that boost in income can be affected by the pro rata tax system because it can take the surplus money that they need to finance themselves through the year. We have had a succession of ministers&mdash;Dawkins, Beazley and Crean, and the progression increases&mdash;who just change things at the drop of a hat. For the reasons I have outlined, the Senate should deplore the way the government is approaching the whole HECS matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will have quite an impact. Until this change, HECS was paid in a lump sum at the end of a financial year. If their total earnings for the year were above the HECS threshold then students were in a position where they did not have to pay tax at this point. Now if students earn $5,000 and it is spread over the full financial year they are not required to pay HECS. For these students there is no particular change. The ALP is now hitting a group of people who work hard for the intensive part of the year and then have to pay this higher rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under pro rata PAYE payments, people finishing higher education for the first time may earn $5,000 in a part-time job over two months and then earn nothing for the remainder of the year. Under this bill they will be required to pay the HECS week by week over the two months through their pay packet. This is one of the mean and unfair ways in which this Labor government is planning to recoup this $2 billion in outstanding debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill says the measure will bring in $5 million for each of the next three years. Why is the government burdening former students who have just finished their courses with this complex scheme that has the anomalies that I have described to the Senate. People struggle after years of study with little or no income. They have been on the poverty line. They finally get into the work force and they are hit with this changed rate of repayment which again upsets their financial planning. Not only do students have problems with planning for the time of study but also they are not too sure what will happen after the time of study because the government keeps changing the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation is bureaucratic and is based on the application of a very complex formula. The rules for determining who has to pay are incredibly complex. It is unfair because students leaving full-time education for the first time already have these large debts. This change, with the government dipping into a person's income, has happened with haste. The government is not waiting to see the full year picture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We seek to amend this bill to remove the pro rata HECS payment. We are also very concerned that this will be a forerunner for the ALP government to bring in more legislation to slug students further&mdash;legislation that could apply a HECS payment to any part-time income, for example. The next step would be to have student vacational income, if over the average weekly earnings on a proportionate basis, incur an earlier payment of the HECS liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students are worried about the prospects and are very uncertain about their financial future. This Labor government will not come clean on its intentions, yet we all know the crisis that it faces financially and the effect this will have on future arrangements for higher education funding. The government has to get its money from somewhere and, unfortunately, instead of the community obligation which has tended to cover much of the funding, what it has increasingly done is slug those who are least able to afford it&mdash;students who are on a very low income. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to respond to some points made in senators' contributions this morning and also to the public contribution, at least via a media release, made by Senator Hill, the shadow minister for education. The debate on the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill has concentrated on the pro rata HECS threshold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue is that, from 1 January 1995, people leaving full-time education for the first time who have a HECS debt will begin repaying their debt immediately if their taxable income during the financial year exceeds the pro rata HECS repayment threshold. In what is proposed to be past practice, individuals who ceased full-time study at some point during a financial year and who entered the work force and earned an annual equivalent income above the first HECS threshold were not required to make a HECS payment in that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of this measure will be consistent with the income tax pro rata arrangements on the tax free threshold for those who stop full-time education for the first time during the year. The repayment salary threshold will be calculated using the proportion of the year that the taxpayer is not in full-time education. Income earned during the study period&mdash;the pre work force income&mdash;will be added to the threshold, calculated on a pro rata basis up to the maximum of the standard thresholds. The resulting thresholds will be measured against all taxable income during the year, including pre work force income, to calculate the necessary repayment amount for the year in respect of the accumulated HECS debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make a number of points which pick up the issues that various speakers in the debate have raised in opposing this provision. Students are not affected if they are on vacation break or enrolled in a course. Students who work during holidays and return to university within four months will not be affected by this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change does not increase the size of an individual's debt. It will bring forward an individual's repayments. The policy applies only to those who cease full-time education for the first time and, therefore, will not affect HECS debtors employed on a casual or contractual basis or those who return to the work force after periods of unemployment, unpaid leave or unpaid maternity leave. Taxpayers who believe that they may earn above the weekly threshold for some weeks, but that their annual taxable income will still be assessed below the pro rata HECS threshold, can obtain a variation certificate from the Australian Taxation Office to give to their employer to reduce their tax instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is provision for a person to postpone payment of his or her HECS debt in cases of financial hardship. If a person's taxable income is over the minimum threshold and a payment is required, but to do so would cause financial hardship, applications can be made to the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation to postpone payment. Repayment would recommence when the person is in a better financial position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will respond directly to some of Senator Hill's comments, particularly those made in media release No. 40 of 1994, put out on 9 November. It is not true, as the opposition has suggested, that the pro rata salary threshold conflicts with the equity principles on which HECS is firmly based. This measure still ensures that only students finishing full-time study and gaining employment at an income above average weekly earnings begin to repay their debt. These are students who have obviously benefited from their education and who are in fact the group of students more likely to be able to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the opposition has its way regarding proposed pro rata payment, its grandstanding on changes to HECS alone over the last two budgets will have cost the government some $51.6 million. Of course, the opposition is long on the rhetoric of suggesting government cuts to balance the budget but very short on the detail. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am getting to some of that detail now. This includes revenue from proposed measures such as double the standard rate of HECS for students studying for second and third undergraduate degrees, savings forgone of $24.5 million, and 1.5 times the standard rate of HECS for students taking overly long to complete their courses, savings forgone of $12.1 million. These measures would have ensured that people using extra higher education resources receive less Commonwealth subsidy, enabling places to be provided for students who had not already had access to higher education. What the opposition fails to understand is that contributions made by students through HECS are returned to the higher education system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some additional points made by Senator Hill and those opposite in opposing this measure include the allegation that the charge has been sprung on students. It is not the case that this measure has been sprung on students. The measure was announced in the 1994-95 budget. It is outlined in the Department of Employment, Education and Training portfolio budget measures statement. The opposition alleged that anomalies arose from the measure, particularly because it will apply only once. It seems to be suggested by the opposition that the proposed change should apply to people returning to employment after periods of maternity leave or unemployment. That is certainly not the government's intention. The measure will only apply the first time a person leaves full-time education to maintain consistency with the Income Tax Rates Act 1986. Sections 16 to 20 of this act relate to pro rata arrangements already applying to the tax-free income threshold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition alleged that the government wants to charge a pro rata HECS payment to students who finish full-time education and gain full-time employment within the same financial year regardless of their total year earnings. The proposed measure does not introduce a pro rata HECS payment. It adjusts the HECS repayment salary threshold to take into account that a person has not been in the work force for a full financial year. Total taxable income for the financial year is compared with this threshold. A person would be considered to have finished full-time education for the purpose of this measure whether or not employment had been obtained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition alleged that the proposed pro rata payments are totally inequitable and make a mockery of the principles under which HECS is supposed to operate and that it would rip $5 million a year from graduates and students who are likely to be able to pay. The pro rata salary threshold does not make a mockery of the equity principles on which HECS is firmly based. This measure still ensures that only students finishing full-time study and gaining employment at an income above average weekly earnings begin to repay their debt. These are students who have obviously benefited from their education and are in fact the group more likely to pay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition also alleged or is suspicious that eventually any student who earns over average weekly earnings in any one week will have to pay HECS regardless of their total yearly earnings. This is alleged to affect contract workers, vacation workers and any student or graduate working for any part of the year. It is not the government's intention to assess HECS repayments on the basis of weekly earnings. HECS assessments are always made on the basis of total taxable income for the financial year. There is also no intention of targeting vacation earnings of students. Clause 12 of the amending legislation, which deals with part-year work force period, has been drafted to specifically exclude students working during holidays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding my remarks, I have a couple of other comments. I do not want to be too harsh on Senator Woods. I will leave rebuttal of his contribution to another day. In respect of Senator Tierney, who talked a great deal about the government's policy&mdash;the same theme came through from Senator Woods&mdash;we will look with interest at what the opposition proposes as a new policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition made the very recent attempt to come up with some sort of policy parameter document, `the things that batter'&mdash;the document that has never seen the light of day since that famous statement by the current Leader of the Opposition (Mr Downer), who may not be so current after the next few weeks. After the opposition's last failed attempt to come up with any policy parameters we look with interest as a government to see what proposals&mdash;within the context of its continual cries for lower government expenditure without increasing taxes&mdash;based on fairness and equity the opposition will be putting forward. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the pro rata provision. The arguments for opposition have been expressed from around the chamber, except for the government. The government apparently feels that it can impose certain obligations on students before they commence their course in relation to repaying HECS and then vary those obligations as their course progresses and as it concludes. This has been a consistent pattern of this government, which increased the rate of HECS, reduced the threshold for HECS and now is ratcheting forward the requirement for repayment of HECS in relation to the students who are covered by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is unfair in our view. As I said in my second reading contribution, the government ought to outline for students at the time they commence their education the obligations that it is going to impose on them in relation to paying part of the cost of that education and the time for and detail of repayment. It has therefore let students down in unilaterally seeking to make these changes that will detrimentally affect a number of such students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my second reading contribution and as others have said today, it discriminates against particular students&mdash;those who have a short period of employment within the financial year within which they finish their education&mdash;in favour of students who for other reasons work only for part of the year. We have no doubt at all in view of the government's pattern in relation to variations to HECS that this is only a step towards introducing a HECS repayment requirement on any part-time work that a student obtains. Therefore, when the spokesman for the government stands today and assures the Senate that that is not the government's intention, all we can do is judge that assurance against the record of this government, which has been to consistently vary the obligation by increasing it and bringing it forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, students who work for what might be just a few weeks during the financial year in which they finish their courses have often had to pay their living costs out of what they earn during that very short period of time. Therefore, the government's attempt to gross out that part-time payment over the whole of the year to bring upon the students the obligation for early repayment is, in our view, not only unjust but also it fails to appreciate the financial reality of students and of those who have just graduated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall the HECS scheme is a fair scheme as it requires the community to make a contribution towards the cost of education. Education is obviously of public benefit and of private benefit. We have no objection to that private benefit being implemented in terms of a debt which is repaid on gaining subsequent employment, but it has to be done in ways which are fair and it should not be unilaterally varied to the disadvantage of students who entered education upon a different undertaking by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, I move this amendment which will delete this discriminatory, unjust and inequitable provision and return us to the previous situation. If we are successful and if the government ultimately accepts the view of the Senate, which I hope it will, students will have the Senate to thank for again bringing this government to account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will also be supporting the amendment moved by Senator Hill. It is entirely parallel to the amendments that were previously circulated in my name, but we will not get into that argument about who thought of what first. I also support the comments made by Senator Hill and the reasons he gave. During the contribution by the parliamentary secretary particular emphasis was placed&mdash;and possibly rightly so&mdash;on what the government is doing here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the statement made by Senator Sherry in support of what the government is doing here&mdash;that this money is taken out of the earnings of those who are earning above average weekly earnings&mdash;can be challenged. At the time a recent graduate may be earning in excess of average weekly earnings. The problem we are faced with is that the assumption is made that that level of earning will continue. That is what is wrong with this whole proposition&mdash;it is based on an assumption which cannot be justified. There is no way that the government can substantiate that assumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about people for whom that assumption may not be true. It is all very well if people are beginning a professional career and the salary structure is such that their initial salary is above average weekly earnings. This means they will be above the HECS threshold and if they are guaranteed five, six or 10 years of constant earnings, they start at that level and go along merrily from there. We are not concerned about those people. I think they will not be concerned about beginning to repay their HECS debt at an earlier stage than they had agreed to. But we are concerned about people in regard to whom the assumption is not true. They might begin employment in what may not be their lifelong profession. They may not have the surety of being employed for a full year. Having been employed for a month or two, they may then face a period of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government still keeps that money. We do not see the minister or the proponents of this proposition organising a scheme whereby the money which has been taken is immediately refunded. No; it has to be held until the end of the financial year and comes back with a tax refund. That is very nice but it does not help people who, having finished education perhaps at the end of November&mdash;and this is another matter that I want to return to&mdash;get a job such as casual bar work for a month over the Christmas period, a bit of delivery work or some promotional work. Perhaps it is the sort of work that can be found at the `Taste of Tasmania'&mdash;a wonderful event that takes place in Tasmania during the Christmas break. A lot of young graduates get themselves a few dollars by working there. But it only lasts for a couple of days. I am sure the parliamentary secretary realises that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People who work during these sorts of carnivals that occur over the summer break are involved in what is only very temporary work. It is lucrative while it is going on and above average weekly earnings are probably received. But the government has retained not only the PAYE tax component but also, as Senator Tierney said, this extra PAYE which has now crept in. This extra tax may be at the level of several per cent. To retain that for the following five or six months is unfair and it was never part of the deal. That is what we need to be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only those people who are affected. People might be working part-time, three or four days a week, receiving perhaps $17,000 or $18,000 a year for that. They may receive, for a couple of months of the year, an offer of full-time employment in the same position, or they might work overtime or act in a higher position for a short time. Immediately, that is taken on a pro rata basis across the threshold; the government steps in, takes the money and keeps it for the taxable year, without paying any regard to the fact, which is a most likely fact, that extra deductible expenses will be incurred in achieving that extra income. The money that is retrieved is proposed to be calculated not on the tax form which is filled in at the end of the year and submitted then; it is taken on a pro rata basis on the assumption that such a level of income will be achieved all the time. </PARA>

As I pointed out in a contribution earlier, even three-year-olds can detect that it is unfair to change the rules while the game is being played.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the concessions made by Mr Willis yesterday that the government was considering an increase in income tax to reduce the gap between its spending and its revenue. That is the Labor government way of doing business, is it not, to put up taxes rather than attack the deficit? I ask: will not the foreshadowed tax increases simply inflate the current wages claims in the same way as projected increases in interest rates have done&mdash;another deliberate policy of the government's, to push up interest rates&mdash;and will the minister give an undertaking that the second phase of the income tax cuts will be delivered without any increase in income taxes in the intervening period?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, my understanding is that Mr Willis said nothing of the kind and it is a complete fabrication that is being uttered by Senator Hill. He made the point that fiscal policy will obviously have to be considered in a budget context. The time is not yet right to do that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are looking at a situation where the deficit may well be much less than that which was forecast&mdash;and Mr Willis made that point&mdash;down from 11.7 to possibly rather less than 11.3. A surplus in 1997-98 as compared with the $2 billion deficit that was originally projected is also possible at this stage on the kinds of figures that are emerging. Against the background of this sort of situation it is simply wildly premature to be contemplating any specific fiscal policy reaction, whether on the further efforts on the outlays side, to the extent that that was possible, or, if it is of another kind, on the revenue side. Mr Willis, as I understand, made it perfectly clear, and I quote him exactly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we made the decision that there needed to be further tightening of fiscal policy, and we decided that had to be done on the revenue side, obviously then we have to decide exactly how that would be done with what tax approach, but we are nowhere near that point at the moment and we may not get to that point.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. The minister knows the code as well as we do. Mr Willis's words follow the words of Mr Keating, and they were both hinting that the government was going to resolve its deficit problem by pushing up interest rates again. We all remember the l-a-w tax cuts promises. I ask the minister: as we were told when the government last broke its tax promises that they would not be implemented until fiscal conditions permit, probably in 1998&mdash;they were the terms of the l-a-w tax cuts breach of promise&mdash;what is the current position in relation to taxes? As the government has pushed up interest rates, can the Australian people now also expect it to push up taxes?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, there is absolutely no change whatsoever in the government's position as stated on the subject of tax cuts, as enunciated very clearly at the time that we brought forward the major set of tax cuts to the obvious benefit of the Australian public. And while we are talking about code, maybe the opposition would decipher some of the code that makes it possible for it to talk about reducing the fiscal deficit and at the same time talk about a tax break on savings which would cost of the order of $10.5 billion to $12.5 billion? Would it break that particular code and tell us how it proposes to do that? How does it propose to do that as a result of public service efficiency gains when the total of public service salaries is $4.9 billion and yet it is talking about cuts of $10 billion to $12 billion if it is going to finance its own promised tax cuts? The opposition is absolutely talking in tongues&mdash;not only in code but in tongues&mdash;and whenever it opens its mouth on fiscal policy it puts its foot in it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer to the release by the Industry Commission of its annual industry review. I note the review concludes that Australia has enjoyed improved industry performance resulting mainly from increased labour productivity but states that further reform is necessary if we are to match future growth of our major trading partners. In this context, the Industry Commission welcomed the increased integration of Australia into the international marketplace. Against this background, can the minister inform the Senate of what strategies the government has in place to ensure that the pace of reform within Australian industry is sufficient to capitalise on our improved productivity and international orientation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industry Commission has in its review highlighted the opening up of the Australian economy to the international marketplace as a key reform over the past decade. It has identified that the challenge for this decade, and indeed for the next century, is to ensure that Australian industry is able to respond to the opportunities that become available and to capture those opportunities. The stakes have been magnified by the opportunities and challenges now open to us because of the work the Prime Minister, the foreign minister and the trade minister did at Bogor a fortnight ago in bringing down the barriers to trade in APEC&mdash;a huge leap forward for Australian industry and a massive opportunity for a country that has gone through a large amount of restructuring to make its industry base more efficient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think is apposite as far as the Industry Commission is concerned is that last week the Australian Manufacturing Council, a tripartite body of business, government and unions, brought down a report&mdash;handed to me by John Prescott, chief executive of BHP and Chairman of the Manufacturing Council&mdash;entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The wealth of ideas: how linkages help sustain innovation and growth</EMPHASIS>. It looks at what needs to be done in the Australian economy to drive economic growth further and to give Australian industry a competitive edge in the booming markets that beckon us in Asia and the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is an interesting report. It builds on all of the work done in the reports by the McKinsey organisation on emerging exporters and the earlier work done on what makes Australian industry more competitive. The report identified that innovation&mdash;the ability to create new ideas&mdash;and being able to transform those new ideas commercially, to keep those scientific or technological ideas in Australia and commercialise them here, are the elements that will drive Australia into a more competitive position in the markets of the world and specifically in the markets of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we see that Australian government spending on research and development is ranked seventh among the countries of the OECD&mdash;that is among our peer group economies in the Western world&mdash;private sector expenditure on research and development is ranked 19th. Therefore, the need to lift private sector expenditure on research and development, particularly in the manufacturing and services areas, to capture the innovative edge and the wealth of ideas the AMC report speaks of is an urgent national necessity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has indicated that about August next year it will be bringing down a major statement on innovation. I look forward to working closely with the leaders of Australian industry and the Australian science community in order to find ways in which the level of private sector investment in research, including that which contributes new ideas and new products to the market, in Australia can be lifted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other important aspects of this report is that it is very important, quite apart from what Professor Michael Porter has said in his very useful work on this subject, for Australian companies to have leading edge customers&mdash;customers that demand high standards. It is with those high standards that leading edge customers provide that Australian industry will stretch targets to lift the quality of and improve the cost of the work that it does. It is a very useful report. It has been well hailed by over 100 business people who attended a conference on that report with me last week. I think in many respects it is a blueprint for the way forward for Australian industry to become more competitive in Asia and the world.</PARA>

He would be aware of the Queensland Labor Premier's unprecedented full page advertisement in last week's national media criticising his handling of the Port Hinchinbrook development. Is it a fact that, as Mr Goss asserts, every one of what he calls `the strictest environmental controls' was checked and approved by the federal government? Is it a fact, as Mr Goss asserts, that these approvals included the removal of the small area of mangroves on which the minister halted work on 15 November? Is Mr Goss correct when he says that the issue of mangrove removal was never specifically discussed by the minister's department or anyone else during the 10 months of the detailed consultations? As the seagrasses have thrived since four-fifths of the mangroves were removed in the 1970s and 1980s, why should the public not see the minister's last minute intervention as nothing more than a grubby attempt to pander to the extremist Green vote, irrespective of the desperate need for national development and regional development in our country?</PARA></TALK.START>

Why has the minister made this decision without ever visiting the Port Hinchinbrook site and without ever speaking with the people who will be forced onto the dole as a result of his intervention in this particular thing?

I believe there are issues involved here of legal process where, if at all possible and without in any way weakening the protection of the barrier system to stop illegal goods and prohibited items coming into the country, we can separate the processes of customs administration from a proper legal warrant being issued by a non-customs person.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be a test for me, but it would be a test that Senator Hill would fail. We have seen that by way of his performance this morning. On the other hand, I thank Senator Zakharov for this question and note that, unlike the cynicism from the other side, she has been interested in the issue of citizenship because, probably unlike the opposition, she recognises that the whole concept of citizenship&mdash;the definition and role of it&mdash;in Australia in the late 20th century goes very much to the concept of how we develop ourselves as a nation. It is a debate in which those on that side of the chamber want to have absolutely no part.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned about the issue. That is why we kicked off a campaign to encourage the 1.1 million or so permanent residents who are eligible to take up citizenship to do so. We also started the campaign to ensure that Australians continue to think and talk about the concept of citizenship and its significance for everyone into the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Zakharov pointed out, the Prime Minister and I launched the campaign at a ceremony that welcomed 45 citizens in Sydney on 4 November.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that date, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has been operating a 24-hour per day, seven-day per week national telephone inquiry service. As a consequence of the campaign and other associated promotions, I am pleased to report that the initial response to that campaign has been enormously encouraging. In only three weeks&mdash;21 days&mdash;the hotline has taken more than 20,500 calls, which is an average of just below 1,000 per day. Those calls have generated a request for 11,125 application kits. The enormity of that response augurs very well for the final outcome that the government wants to achieve, which is that those inquiries translate into applications for citizenship. I repeat that there have been 20,500 calls and 11,125 requests for kits in less than three weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Zakharov also said, the government is concerned to ensure that people talk about the concept of citizenship and its meaning for Australians towards the end of the 20th century. The campaign that we launched in Sydney was one of a number of campaign launches. There have been launches in all other states. Two things have tended to emerge from those launches and the number of people involved with them. The first is the diversity of the backgrounds from which the people have come. The second is the enormous pride that they all take in making a commitment to Australia.</PARA>

I refer to four recent government decisions; namely, the new cable television rules, the ditching of the open skies agreement with New Zealand, the ANL rescue package, and the Creative Nation commitment to assist in the site preparation and development of a movie studio in Sydney. Is it a fact that at least three of these four decisions are the very antithesis of Hilmer and will reduce, rather than enhance, competition? Why were none of these decisions approved by cabinet, only by the Prime Minister in collaboration with various ministerial mates from the New South Wales Right? Given Mr Keating's long record of doing deals not in the public interest, why should Australians not be extremely suspicious of this repeated avoidance of cabinet scrutiny of prime ministerial decisions?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is quite obvious that these were major, controversial decisions, all completely ignored by the Prime Minister in terms of cabinet consultation&mdash;contempt for the democratic process. I ask: if the minister seriously claims that there were time constraints in respect of each of these decisions, why does he not spell out what those time frames were and why it was that the government did not have time to quite get around to having each of those decisions properly considered by his colleagues? For example, is it not a fact that the cable television rules will now force Australians to pay more for local phone calls, which will mean that the pay television industry will remain heavily subsidised by a taxpayer owned government enterprise in the form of Telecom?

That opens the way for oil companies to seek a range of remedies provided for in the act.

Existing Commonwealth and state laws provide ample scope and flexibility to deal with an emergency situation. In the case of every state, there is emergency services legislation presently in existence and, in the case of the Commonwealth, in relation to serious industrial action of this kind, there are various remedies available, including bans clauses, stand downs, suspension of awards, orders restricting a registered organisation's rights under the Industrial Relations Act; plus there are common law remedies, for example, for interfering with contract.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Authorities conducting meat inspection at domestic meatworks in New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have instituted an equivalent inspection and sampling program to those in place at export meatworks for cattle sourced from the risk areas. This involves, as I have said, a 100 per cent lot testing program of cattle from properties in the risk areas. Product is removed from the domestic food chain if testing indicates levels above the MRL. The National Health and Medical Research Council has advised that consumption of meat containing CFZ residues up to the MRL presents no risk to human health and the MRL was deliberately set at a very conservative level to ensure that meat would be quite safe to eat.</PARA>

But there is always a high level of cooperation and that cooperation has been evidenced on this occasion. Constitutional responsibility for the control and use of agricultural and veterinary chemicals rests with the states but, as I am sure Senator Bell knows, the registration of agricultural chemicals will be under the control of national legislation from early next year when the national registration scheme is expected to commence after the final two states, Western Australia and Tasmania, have passed the required legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Australians have seen a quite remarkable and unprecedented action by a state Labor premier in that he has taken out a full-page advertisement in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and many other sections of the national media&mdash;certainly, the media in North Queensland&mdash;publicly criticising the way in which the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner, has handled the Oyster Point-Port Hinchinbrook matter. Mr Goss is concerned about the backflips by Senator Faulkner&mdash;the fact that Senator Faulkner has had all the details of this proposal for several months and it was not until right at the death that Senator Faulkner chose to take some action to stop work on the project. That, of course, raises the point as to whether there is any serious environmental concern by Senator Faulkner about this matter or whether it is simply part of the ongoing Labor Party factional brawl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that a prominent Queensland unionist has now become involved in this Oyster Point matter. It is a unionist by the name of Ian McLean. I do not quite know what Mr McLean's union is but I was not aware that it had any major involvement in this Oyster Point project. It is interesting, Mr Deputy President, as you would know, that Mr McLean used to be the Queensland president of the ALP. He is a member of the Left, like Senator Burns, but he was unceremoniously dumped in a bloody coup by Premier Goss earlier this year. So this left wing president of the Queensland Labor Party was dumped by Goss and his right wing mates, and he has been absolutely fuming ever since. One cannot help thinking that Mr McLean has got his left wing factional allies, Senator Faulkner, Senator Burns and Senator Reynolds, onto the job to embarrass Mr Goss and to make Mr Goss pay for the stabbing of their mate Mr McLean. </PARA>

Mr Goss also says&mdash;this is his big plea&mdash;that this resort `was approved in the 1980s by the National Party Government'. So he is saying, `We did not have any choice in the matter, we good little Labor government.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he does not say is that his own Labor government in the last few months has given the developer the most environmentally damaging approvals for this project. It is the Queensland state Labor government which has given a permit to discharge into the marine park under the Clean Waters Act. It has also given a Canals Act permit, a Harbours Act permit, a Marine Parks Act approval and a permit to clear 6.5 hectares of mangroves for what the developer calls `aesthetic reasons' and what Senator Parer calls `the total concept'. It is the Queensland state Labor government which has given a permit to occupy a marine park. Mr Goss could have refused any of these permits, but instead he forced them through. Mr Goss has also said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of extensive environmental assessment . . . we approved a smaller project with some of the strictest environmental controls ever imposed on a development in this State.</PARA>
<PARA>How misleading is that? There has never been a full environmental impact assessment. There may well be an agreement with environmental controls, but it has already been breached for several reasons&mdash;by mud slump into the creek, by no independent environmental monitor and by the developer not providing monthly updated work plans as he was requested to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Goss in his letter also says that Senator Faulkner says he took his action because of his concern about the effect of mangrove removal of the seagrass beds in the World Heritage area. He goes on to say that no such concern has been mentioned by anyone during the 10 months of detailed consultation. This is probably the most misleading thing. </PARA>

<PARA>Normally when one receives an answer to a question about which one is confused, one asks a supplementary question. The response by Senator Crowley was so vacuous and so nonsensical that I just did not feel like asking another question to get a similar response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to understand what Senator Crowley's response was, and to do that we need to put it into context. I prefaced my question by referring to her answer to my question of 15 November. In that question I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If, as the minister states constantly, child care is a cost of earning income, why is it not also a cost for a one-income family in which one spouse cannot engage in paid work if the other does not care for the children?</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to a number of other questions. Her response to me, as I adverted to in my question today, was that there are basically no outlays for the cost of child care provided in the home as compared with the cost of child care outside the home. Then she went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no comparable example in any other tax systems for the transfer of costs within the family itself.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously she has not heard of the US, French, Irish, Belgian and other tax systems which recognise the contribution of spouses to earning family income by allowing income splitting or quotient apportionment for family members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today she said she did not resile from her statement. She did not answer the questions that I again asked today. Does she really think the labour of a non-earning spouse caring for children at home costs nothing while that provided by others is worth something? Does she think that mothers who have made the decision originally or at the time to leave the paid work force to look after their children forgo no income? Does she truly believe that? If she does, she is off the planet. I am really worried about Senator Crowley and her understanding of her portfolio of family services. How can she deny that a direct cost is incurred and income is forgone where a spouse looks after the children?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is so clear to me and I am sure to all the Senate that the response of the Minister for Family Services was a dreadful failure. What did she also say? She rubbed salt into the wound. She said that one does not get any payment for lawn mowing. Lawn mowing! I did not think the minister believed that lawn mowing was a cost of earning income. We are talking about the cost of earning income. The minister herself has agreed that child care is a cost of earning income. If one spouse is earning the income, surely a cost is incurred by the other spouse caring for the children. </PARA>

It is incredible. The fact is that it is recognised when families split up, when divorce takes place. We all know that, in family law decisions, work performed by the non-wage earning spouse is recognised for the purposes of income splitting.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately when ministers sit on the front bench, often when they are answering questions they do not see the looks on the faces of their colleagues who sit behind them. It would have been a good experience for Senator Crowley in recent times if while she was answering a question she had turned around and seen the look of dismay on the faces of her colleagues. Senator Crowley would have to be one of the weak links in the Labor government. We know that there are many weak links, but she would have to be one of the weakest. I was absolutely astounded during her answer when she referred to the unpaid work of lawn mowing and laundry type work within the home. I have never known that the government considered that it would be appropriate, for example, to subsidise laundromats within the local community or to provide a subsidy for lawn mowing so that people can go out to work. But that is what she has done with child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Crowley honestly believes that the role of a parent looking after a child at home ought to be equated with the role of a person who might mow the lawn once a fortnight, who might do the washing every couple of days&mdash;or, if there are a lot of children, possibly every day&mdash;and that he or she ought to be treated in the same way as a parent who makes a deliberate decision for the benefit of those children, and ultimately for the benefit of society and Australia, to forgo income to give those kids a head start, then she is mistaken. She parades around this country as the Minister for Family Services, but that would have to be a misnomer because she does not seem to have a grasp of what families are about or the services they need. As the Minister for Family Services she has been a dismal failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party in Senator Crowley has a minister who is grossly incompetent. She is an embarrassment to her colleagues and she has a unique capacity of not coming to grips with the questions that are fielded to her by anybody other than the government. Today we witnessed her trying to respond to Senator Nick Minchin, my friend and colleague from South Australia, who also has a very strong background in support of families and the services that they need. He has been a good advocate for them in this chamber. When he asked his question what did we see Senator Crowley do? Her defence was, `Senator Minchin has asked the wrong question.' She could not answer the question, so what did she do? She said, `Senator Minchin, you have asked the wrong question.' That sort of display by a minister is nothing short of embarrassing to Australia as a whole. It is not about party politics. If a minister does not have a grasp of the subject matter at hand and says to an opposition senator, `I cannot answer that question because you have asked the wrong one,' then surely she has a problem. Similarly, for the way that she treated Senator Harradine today at question time she also deserves to be condemned. </PARA>

<PARA>The government made its position perfectly clear on this particular matter when it was last debated in this place on 16 November. The particular request seeking an additional appropriation of $3 million in order to cover the administrative costs is not accepted by the government as being a reasonable further impost, given the large amount of money that has been made available for the total purpose of this legislation, including not only land purchasing and land administration but also the administration of the process itself. </PARA>

I was listening very carefully to Senator Evans's words when he was trying to justify the rationale for the House of Representatives' rejection of this amendment.

In particular, `land acquisition fund' has disappeared from the government's vocabulary in relation to this land fund bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rejection by the House of Representatives of this $3 million additional request, which would actually quarantine the acquisition and management funding from the costs of administration, has been done on the most patently hypocritical of grounds. Not having been able to support an endeavour to quarantine acquisition funding from management funding by supporting an amendment of the Greens in the committee, the government now refuses to limit the amount of administration funding to what it initially stated was a $3 million cap. The government's own figure was used for that amendment. It said it will grant $3 million in administration. If the administration costs remained at that level of $3 million, the only thing eating into the management and acquisition funding would be the management costs under this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The refusal of the House of Representatives&mdash;and also of the government and the Democrats in this chamber&mdash;to support that request to the House of Representatives indicates that it does not actually want to prevent the administration costs eating away at the acquisition component of the land fund. </PARA>

I want to put on the public record why, just in case that motion does not get agreed to. It is a legitimate right of mine to pronounce what I consider are the implications of, firstly, the rejection in the House of Representatives of our request and, secondly, the committee's inability to press that request. It means we are acceding to something the government has done that shows up its credibility in relation to the Aboriginal people of this country who stand to gain nothing from the native title legislation or from any management funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal people of this country who deserve and need this land fund are those who have been totally dispossessed by settlement of this country. They are the people who need to acquire land, which will in some places replace what they no longer are able to gain under the native title legislation. In some cases it will mean that they can acquire land which could have been theirs if it had not been taken up with other forms of title which extinguish native title. They will be able to reacquire the land that was originally their people's land and their people's country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government refusal to quarantine the administration costs from those of acquisition and management is a despicable act. It is a miserly amount, not a generous amount as seems to be implied by the rhetoric of the government and of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and even by the media's false acceptance of the government's words. It is a paltry amount of $21 million, which was going to be $21 million for the ILC in this coming year and for the next three years, with $3 million for administration costs. We are now told that there is no guarantee that there will even be $21 million available because the Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, in the House of Representatives stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government rejects the idea of a cap on the administrative expenses of the ILC and, consequently, any further appropriation to cater for those expenses.</PARA>
<PARA>We now know that this government is only prepared to give $24 million beyond its current allocation for the land acquisition and management costs within Australia for the Aboriginal community. It is not prepared to increase the allocation by a measly $3 million and neither is it willing to quarantine the inroads of any administrative costs that might go beyond that $3 million from eating into acquisition funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This should be on the public record because the government's credibility is in tatters. This is not the fund the Prime Minister announced, at the time of the native title debate, would be set up for those dispossessed&mdash;95 per cent of the Aboriginal people of this country&mdash;who do not stand to gain from native title. It is a management fund; it is a duplicate bureaucracy to that of the ATSIC land fund bureaucracy. It has no credibility in the eyes of any Aboriginal person who has no land at the present moment. It is a signal to such Aboriginal people that, unless they are within a few steps from the front of the queue for this miserly amount of $21 million, they will get nothing. They will never get anything because the amount will be totally eaten into by management and administration within the next 10 years, our best case scenario, or possibly far quicker than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens indicate we would like to press this amendment. We are not proposing to call a division if we do not have support, but we want to clearly indicate that it deserves to be pressed. We deserve an answer as to why the government cannot do better than this paltry fund, which it is refusing to amend or concede any improvement to by the consideration of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a government that is incapable of managing a democracy. It is quite capable of negotiating agreements outside the parliament. It is quite capable of pushing legislation through the House of Representatives by numbers. But it is incapable of accepting that Australia has a bicameral system of parliament, that the people have a say, that there is a states aspect to the legislation, that there is a review aspect to the legislation and that the Senate has a perfect right to amend this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask those people who are not pressing the amendment and who might seek to go on to the third reading to be warned, because the minister, Mr Beazley, has also made it quite clear in his statements in the House of Representatives that not only is the government not supporting the request for $3 million more to quarantine the administrative costs from the land management and acquisition costs but the government has indicated that it is not prepared to support any of the amendments that have been made in the Senate, or at least to support what Senator Evans referred to as the seven deadly sins. I think the seven deadly sins have been replaced by one deadly sin, which is the deadly sin of the government that it is so arrogant that it will not accept what has happened in the debate in the Senate and it will not even accept an increase of $3 million on its current allocation. Let the whole Aboriginal community and all those who care about social justice for Aboriginal people take note that this is where this government comes from. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have thought about this matter. I have had the opportunity to read what was said in the House of Representatives in response to our request. I think it was a cavalier approach taken by the government, knowing that it had the numbers in the House of Representatives on this issue. We debated this particular request, not ad nauseam but at length. I believed, and still believe, that the arguments advanced in support of the request were valid. I still believe they are valid.</PARA></TALK.START>

Well, be it on their heads. I do not want to see this legislation jettisoned. I want to see it do what it was meant to do&mdash;that is, to provide as much money as possible to be used as far as possible for the acquisition and management of land, not to be eaten up by endless uncapped administrative expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been public discussions about that issue. The suggestion was made: why not increase the amount by $3 million in addition to that which was suggested by the government? Of course, we could not amend the bill because we did not have the constitutional power to do so. What we had to do was make a request to the House of Representatives for that to occur. The government has now made it clear that it is not interested. We want to add an additional $3 million, but it is not interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government makes the unfounded assertion that we do not have regard for what ATSIC says about this matter. We do. I have certainly had regard for what ATSIC has said and written about a whole range of matters. Perhaps in contradistinction to some people, I have agreed with much that they have said on some other issues over the years. But I do not think we should be kowtowing with regard to what the government might or might not do. I think the legislation should achieve its objectives. I saw this request as one of the means of achieving those objectives, or at least the basis for ensuring that the objectives, as far as that was possible, were achieved. </PARA>

I would like to see this motion defeated, the third reading take place and then for us to look at the amendments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened carefully to what Senator Chamarette and Senator Harradine have said. One of the coalition's concerns is that the government has shown no sense of fairness when it has dealt with any of the proposals put up by the Senate. We know that the proposal that extra funds be appropriated to meet the administrative expenses of the land fund was a very genuine attempt at bipartisanship on this matter. I think it was a test for the government as to whether it wanted to be bipartisan&mdash;or non-partisan, to use the Democrats' phraseology&mdash;on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was appalled to read the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on the Friday before last that said that opposition senators, the Greens and Senator Harradine had obstructed the progress of this legislation and were holding up the expenditure of $200 million. I think it was a very sad reflection on what is widely regarded as a quality national and international newspaper that whoever wrote that editorial should have been deceived by the spin doctors in the Prime Minister's department that $200 million was going to Aboriginals. Clearly, no-one from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper had listened to one nanosecond of the debate in the Senate if they could be fooled to think there was $200 million waiting to be spent on Aboriginal land acquisition. Of course, the amount, as Senator Chamarette told us almost daily, is only 10 per cent of that amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This request should have highlighted the government's hypocrisy on this legislation because it was a request for $3 million to pay for the administration and a generous percentage of the amount available for land acquisition. The government and its spin doctors chose to say, `We're putting a cap on their expenditure.' They did not choose to focus on the fact that we were actually seeking an extra $3 million. It certainly was a test of the government's goodwill on this matter. Last time we were debating this matter in committee Senator Gareth Evans had to put up his seven deadly sins, which we have called the seven straw men. He had to say, `These are all the things that are unliveable and unworkable about this legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, in putting out its media release shortly after Senator Evans made his statement in this place, went through and rebutted the workability of these notions. To say that the government could not possibly live with $3 million more for administration is, of course, a joke. To say that the national strategies could be integrated with the regional strategies is, of course, a joke&mdash;and it is simply stupid to suggest that they should not be integrated. To say that the ILC must have perpetual control and that de facto ownership of the land is unworkable is, of course, a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one that really hits home and really exposes the arguments of government members against the amendments and why they will not even come to the table and talk about them&mdash;not even discuss them, not consider them&mdash;is that if we press the request they will put the bill aside, will not even consider it, will give the money to ATSIC and will not even discuss it. They showed that when they dealt with the $3 million request. The Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) spoke for about two minutes and said, `No, we are not having that. Send it back.' That is how much consideration the government gave to what could only be regarded as a bipartisan, non-partisan gesture to test the government's goodwill on this matter&mdash;and, of course, there is no goodwill. The ultimate one is that the government says there should be no consultation with traditional owners. So the ILC will go into an area wanting to purchase some land saying that it is unworkable and not fair that we be required to go and talk to the traditional owners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette and I had the opportunity to discuss this position with Justice Robert French, the head of the Native Title Tribunal, last Thursday. We were discussing all of these matters of giving notice to traditional owners under the Native Title Act provisions and what is required to find out where all the parties are in the mediation process. Of course, Justice French could not discuss his personal views on that but, quite frankly, anyone who has been out there dealing with land issues could not possibly concede the logic of the government's argument that one can go into an area and purchase some land and not seek out the views of the traditional owners. There are three other ones as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has shown no willingness to move forward on any of these amendments at all. I am not saying there are more Aboriginal groups supporting these amendments than there are not. We do not know that. People come and talk to us; we talk to them; Lois O'Donoghue puts her view and says, `If you don't agree with this bill as it stands, you are wrecking the reconciliation process.' There are all of these views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with pressing this request is that it puts the government in control and allows it to put the bill aside, to shelve it, to send the money to ATSIC, or to do any of those things. The Senate would not be doing its duty if it allowed that to happen. Just to press this one request and allow the issue of this $3 million to be the thing that is considered by the government is not the sensible, legislative way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would foreshadow, as a more practical way to resolve this matter, that the matter of the amendments and the request be referred to a Senate select committee. I foreshadow that I will move that. I ask that the motion, including the terms of reference, be distributed in the chamber now and that the Senate give consideration to this motion. I foreshadow it at the moment, but I propose that the matter of the amendments that have been made by the Senate, as well as the request for the extra administration money, be referred to a Senate select committee. That committee would be required to consult with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities around Australia as to the workability and the general nature of the amendments, whether or not they in fact seek to achieve what the parliament seeks those amendments and the bill to achieve&mdash;in other words, to allow the people who are most affected to have a first-hand say in the amendments, particularly these crucial ones that have caused the disagreement amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is much disagreement in the community. We have only to look to this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>.

It states that there are divisions that need more negotiation and consultation to solve and that this is the right way to go. </PARA>

I would propose that the Senate select committee be made up of two people nominated by the government; three by the Leader of the Opposition; one by the Australian Democrats; and one by either the Greens or Senator Harradine. I propose that the committee be required to report at the earliest possible time&mdash;that is, 31 January 1995&mdash;so the government cannot accuse the Senate of any delay. There would be no more possible delay than would happen under the government's scheme, which is to set it aside or basically to dump the bill altogether. I also propose that the terms of reference be as read. The amendment has been circulated and, clearly, will have to be dealt with later. I, therefore, propose that this committee now report progress. </PARA>

It is another thing to describe a tactic being adopted by a particular senator, reflecting the view of his own party room, as dishonest. In all the circumstances of the case, that is what Senator Kernot was doing. She is fully entitled to do so in accordance with the precedents of this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. It happens. I am happy to withdraw it if Senator Campbell thinks it applies to him. But I still think it applies to the tactic. It is a dishonest tactic to seek to delay for five hours a simple debate and a vote on the matter of a request so that one can have an emergency meeting to work out tactics on how to deal with avoiding to take a vote on this land fund bill at any cost. That is what this is about and the opposition cannot hide from it. It is a disgrace&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

The opposition thinks it can get away with this little tactic. It thinks, `Send it off again. Who will take any notice of another select committee? Who cares about the cost or the time? The most important thing is that we do not get a debate on this bill before Christmas.' That is its primary motive, and I object to it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments are clear on both sides. They were amply and well debated. I stress again the substantive point: the government's proposal doubles the current allocation for acquisition and management of Aboriginal land, it appropriates funds for 10 years into the future and it establishes a billion dollar fund which will be entirely devoted to funding land acquisition and management in the indefinite future. All of this is on top of current allocation to ATSIC of some $900 million, plus $400 million-odd to other agencies.

<PARA>I take this opportunity to respond to the remarks of Senator Kernot, who is obviously angry and frustrated at this move. It cannot be said that the Senate is in any way delaying consideration of this bill. It was the government which said that it would withdraw this bill and put the funding through ATSIC. It is the government which said that if we insist on the request the bill could be set aside. It is the government which has refused to even contemplate any amendments whatsoever. It has mentioned its seven deadly sins as things it could not possibly live with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said on each occasion when amendments have been put up that it has had this most broad consultation process in the history of Australia. Particularly those of us who sat on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration know just what that consultation was. There is a document on the public record&mdash;it was provided to the committee&mdash;which sets out who was actually written to in relation to that legislation. We know from the public utterances of Aboriginal groups and Aboriginal individuals across Australia, and from those who gave evidence to the committee, that the consultation process was far from adequate. We know that many Aboriginal groups support radical amendment to the land fund bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is certainly disagreement. The Greens think there should be certain amendments that we do not agree to. Senator Harradine supports some amendments that we do not agree to. There is some common ground between the Greens and the coalition on a range of amendments. There is even common ground between the government and the coalition on some minor amendments, but there is broad disagreement amongst many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people and their representatives on the shape of this bill. Senator Chamarette made it quite clear during the debate that she thought it would be better not to have any land fund bill than have the one the government has at the moment without the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition now seeks, in a timely way, through the weeks available in January, until 31 January, to move throughout the community and get genuine feedback and conduct genuine consultation on the ground by talking to the Aboriginal people and to Torres Strait Islanders to find out what they really think about the bill and the amendments. It is a genuine consultation process&mdash;something that has not been touched on by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time the government consults, it makes a phone call. We do not quite know whom it rings. But it can make a decision to oppose the $3 million of administration expenses at the drop of a hat. It is quite incredible that any Aboriginal group would say, `We do not want $3 million to pay for the administration. We would rather have the $3 million eat into the money available for land acquisition.' That must have been a very interesting consultation. We are saying that the government should go out and talk to the people affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has come a long way in proposing amendments that focus the bill and in fact make it more representative of and more effective in addressing the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. We may not have it right. We are not like the government in that we cannot say, `We think our amendments are the be all and end all. We think that when our amendments go through the bill will be perfect.' We know very well that the bill will not be perfect, but we know equally well that if you go out and do a genuine, thorough consultation process then you will probably get it more right than it is now. That is why we are proposing this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could have predicted five hours ago that if we proposed a Senate select committee Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Kernot would say, `You are delaying it.' We are not delaying it; we are actually giving the bill some life. If Senator Kernot had voted on the request, it would have been shunted back over there. The government has already said that it will not accept any amendments and it would set the bill aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are saying that we will use the next few weeks constructively to find out how we could make the bill work. They are the specific terms of reference. A specific task is to make the legislation effective, to try to reconcile the differences, to try to figure out whether when Senator Evans says that these things are unworkable they are unworkable. We will be convinced. If they are unworkable, then we will be convinced and constructive, but the government will not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time frame is short&mdash;it is shorter than it really should be&mdash;but we specifically said the first sitting day of 1995, which is 31 January, so that we could not be accused of delay. Quite frankly, we should probably have the committee sitting for another month or so so it can be done even further, but we said, `Let's make it the first day in January so we can't be accused of delay.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that if the government and the Democrats got their way the bill would go back over to the House of Representatives, which might pick up two or three of the less contentious amendments and send it back over here without agreement to 65 of them. It would not do any genuine consultation because that does not suit the political agenda of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot talks about triggers and so forth, but the reality is that this makes not one iota of difference to all of that. That is not our intent. For Senator Kernot to suggest that it is the coalition's intent is quite ridiculous. We could have had the vote on the request today. </PARA>

We have now been told after 30 hours of debate that the government just cannot live with it. We have seven sets of amendments that it just cannot possibly live with. I repeat, because it astounds me, that one of those things that the government cannot live with is the fact that, when the ILC goes out to purchase some land, it is considered unworkable that it goes and speaks to traditional owners. That is absolutely outrageous. It is outrageous that it cannot live with $3 million being set aside for administration expenses to ensure that the money goes to land acquisition and management.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government rejects this proposed course of action by the opposition for reasons that I will now fully spell out. In the first place, there is no substance whatsoever to the argument about lack of consultation in the lead-up to the debate on the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. The consultation has continued to occur throughout the long period that we have been debating this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, the land fund was initially established by the Native Title Act, with all the consultation and discussion that was entailed in the lead-up to the enactment of that legislation. It was an important part of the total package that this land fund was coming. The broad principles were debated and discussed in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill was developed on the basis of consultation with all interested parties. The Special Minister of State wrote to all ATSIC regional councils, prescribed organisations under the Native Title Act and peak indigenous industry, farming, mining, environmental and religious organisations. He did that on 11 April 1994, seeking the submission of views on the structure and operation of the proposed land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A long list of specific responses to that invitation were received in writing. Those responses were, on the whole, very positive and very constructive. In addition, a number of unsolicited contributions were received from a number of Aboriginal organisations, including the Kimberley Aboriginal Association, the Ballarat and District Aboriginal Co-op, the South Australian Aboriginal Lands Trust, the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account Advisory Committee and the Danila Dilba Medical Service operating out of Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) met with representatives of major Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations on 18 April. At that meeting, indigenous representatives agreed that the land fund should be administered by an independent specialist body with a focus on indigenous land issues. The broad principles of this legislation were thoroughly canvassed. The Prime Minister met again with these representatives on 16 June 1994. Prior to that meeting, those representatives were provided with copies of the draft bill, turning the broad principles into specific legislative form. Consensus was reached on the main features of the legislation, and a number of changes were made to address particular concerns raised at that meeting. The bill lay on the table over the whole of the winter recess, allowing a further opportunity for consideration of its provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, to whom the bill was referred, embarking on its own consultative process. It met on 23 September, but after an exercise designed to bring to it from around Australia a number of people to give evidence about it. On that occasion, evidence was taken not only from ATSIC but also from the Swan Valley Noongah Community Group, the Kimberley Aboriginal Association, the Eastern Goldfields, the Warrungah community, the New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council and the Northern Territory government as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aboriginal groups met in Melbourne in November to discuss the bill during the course of this process. A further process of consideration and input to our deliberative processes occurred on that occasion. The Greens claimed during this debate that they had consulted extensively on the terms of the bill and their amendments to it. As a result of those consultations, they were opposed to various things in the bill. They were not claiming that they had not had enough time for consultation. They were saying that, as a result of the consultations that had already occurred, they took the view that a whole variety of things in the legislation needed to be fixed. It is an argument utterly at odds with the claim now of a need for further consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that a degree of disagreement is apparent among intended beneficiaries of this legislation. That ain't unusual in the legislative process. People might agree with the broad principles of the legislation but they may want more money, a different process to apply or further opportunities for particular barrows to be pushed. That is life. That is the legislative reality with which we deal every day of the week when we pass legislation. If we seek to wait until such time as all possible disagreements are subject to all possible processes and all possible attempts are made at reaching all possible forms of agreement, we would never legislate about anything. That is the truth of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also cannot say that this was a precipitate process as far as the parliament itself was concerned. Indeed, my quick calculation is that in the recorded history of the timing of debates in this place&mdash;certainly since 1950 when these records started to be kept&mdash;this is the 12th longest debate in the history of the Senate. We have spent a total of 27 hours and 10 minutes debating this legislation. We spent four hours and 40 minutes on the second reading in the week beginning 17 October. In committee we spent a total of 22 hours and 30 minutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has been exhaustively debated as to its terms and its content all the way through and on the basis of claims and counterclaims about what particular Aboriginal groups who have been subject to the consultative process and input into the process actually wanted. To make the claim at this stage that there has been incomplete consideration of this either by the Senate's own processes or by the consultation which led up to the Senate's own processes is to state a palpable nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I want to make echoes that of Senator Kernot earlier on. The real reason the opposition wants to refer this matter to a select committee is simply to avoid somehow being caught once again in Aboriginal policy between a rock and a hard place on this particular issue. The opposition is profoundly embarrassed by the mess it has got itself into on Aboriginal policy. It is scrambling, desperately hoping that it can find some way out of the awful impasse that it confronts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press was full of reports, sourced to opposition spokesperson Mrs Gallus, last Friday that the opposition might in fact backflip in its position on these amendments because it did not want a double dissolution trigger. Someone was again reported as saying that the opposition would look seriously at the bill when it re-entered the Senate. I indicate right now that the government has every intention of bringing the bill back to the Senate after an appropriate lapse of time to enable the opposition to have further consideration of it. There is nothing we want more than to pass this legislation in due course. We would like to pass it as soon as possible, but if it takes a longer, more indirect process so be it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition seems to be moving in that direction. It has said that it would look seriously at the bill when it re-entered the Senate in order to avoid the possibility of being caught in the electoral politics of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But then we were told in another report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> that other senior Liberals last night were not backing Mrs Gallus on this particular matter. `This could prove to be an embarrassing gaffe for her' to float this particular option in the way she did. Indeed, it did seem to be an embarrassing gaffe because that is exactly where she has found herself with, once again, the props taken out from under her by her leaderless leadership which simply wants nothing more now than to find some way of putting off the day until, hopefully, in the new year some time maybe, somehow, the issue will go away and some solution will present itself that will be more politically palatable than the impossible position the opposition has got itself into at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So now it is proposed, in order to advance that particular sleazy political objective, to send this off to a committee for an utterly unnecessary further process. The process that I have described of consultation is answer in itself to the necessity for this process now. It is absolutely unnecessary. There is ample opportunity for any further process of deliberation that people want to engage in, a rethinking of the amendments that have been passed, a further consideration as to whether they are or are not unworkable, as the government sincerely continues to claim they are, in the period which would normally elapse between the reintroduction of this legislation in the House of Representatives and its further consideration in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the final point, lest there be any doubt about it, that the government will treat this reference to a select committee if it is carried&mdash;as it seems certain it will be&mdash;as a failure to pass this legislation within the meaning of section 57 of the constitution. There is ample precedent for this. For example, in 1951 there was a double dissolution when a reference to a select committee was followed two days later by an application to the Governor-General for a double dissolution. That reference to a select committee in all the circumstances of the case then was treated as a failure to pass and so I am sure it would be on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make the point, in making the point in these terms, that the government wants this legislation. We are not looking for some artificial trigger for a double dissolution. As the Prime Minister said, support for this bill would be welcome for any reason. There are alternative ways of delivering funding support for land acquisition without this bill, but they are infinitely less satisfactory than this bill because what this bill establishes is a billion dollar fund, a firm legislative framework, proper legislative process, proper structures and proper criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want this legislation and will continue to do everything we can to have it passed in a workable form by this parliament. We are not looking for some artificial excuse not to pursue this particular legislation. We want it and will seek it by all available means. If we cannot get it any other way, we will be prepared to go down the path of securing its passage ultimately by a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament following the process laid out in the constitution. I give notice now that that is the course that we will follow. </PARA>

I spoke of seven particular problem areas&mdash;the seven deadly sins, as I described them&mdash;of this legislation as it has now been sat upon, not passed, and failed to be passed by the Senate. Every single one of those amendments went to a fundamental issue so far as the workability in practice of this legislation is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why we want to proceed with the bill in the form, so far as these particular subject areas are concerned, in which we originally moved it.

It is a piece of legislation that has been sincerely crafted after an extremely extensive process of consultation. We believe it does reflect the wishes of the overwhelming majority of Aboriginal people in this country. We argue and believe that it is right in principle and it is the right piece of legislation at this time. For all those reasons, we reject this particular reference to a committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I just want to say at the outset that the coalition had advice to the effect that taking such a course of action could well be viewed as a failure to pass. Section 57 of the constitution says that if the Senate rejects or fails to pass legislation then those provisions can be brought into effect. I might not happen to agree with that interpretation; nonetheless, it is a piece of advice that the coalition had and it took this decision knowing that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When a person levels an accusation at the coalition saying that we are merely taking this action to avoid any trigger for a double dissolution, that person does not know what he is talking about. We had advice to that effect. Section 57 of the constitution says `if the Senate fails to pass it'. We have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) say quite clearly that the government is going to take the approach that this is a failure to pass. The minister has indicated quite clearly that the government will use the provisions of section 57 of the constitution to cause a double dissolution if need be. That has quite clearly been admitted by the minister and it is obviously something which has been on the government's agenda throughout. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the coalition's approach to the legislation, there has been from the beginning of the debate in this matter a question of lack of consultation. In fact, the question of lack of consultation was raised in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. On page 18 of that report, Mr Robert Bropho from the Swan Valley Noongah community of Western Australia was reported as saying that neither he nor his group whom he represented had been consulted. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As he said, "First of all, you have to consult with the Aboriginal people."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Me and my mob believe that you should consult the people first. You do not go and make these decisions and then come back and tell the blacks."</PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, Mr Dickie Cox from the Kimberley Aboriginal Association complained:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our people need to know what is going on. Our people in the Kimberleys told us to come down and find out, because we have not had any people&mdash;not even those from ATSIC or the government departments&mdash;come and tell us what has been happening lately.</PARA>
<PARA>That was raised at the outset. During the days of debate on this bill, some 67 amendments were passed and a request was made for an extra $3 million per annum to be spent. The amendments I mentioned were of great substance, not to mention the request that the government took such exception to that it referred it immediately to the other place where it was rejected and sent back to this house. The government has also indicated that it will not be accepting the coalition's amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a situation where we know what the government is going to do. If we pass these amendments and the legislation is sent back to the other place, the government will reject it and send it back here. There will be further delays. We might as well use this period usefully to make up for the lack of consultation that took place previously. During the debate on this legislation the people from the remote communities of Far North Queensland, the Northern Territory, northern New South Wales, north of South Australia and north-west of Western Australia could not be here. They were not glued to the radio listening to the broadcast. They did not watch it live on television. They were in areas where they did not have ready access to this sort of debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now giving the Aboriginal community across Australia a chance to have a look at the bill and at the amendments which have been put forward and then to pass some comment, to put forward an invaluable contribution towards the resolution of this matter. We have seen the press give great coverage to the division in the Aboriginal community on these very amendments. There has been no attempt on the part of the government to try to bring some form of consensus&mdash;which it so frequently talks about&mdash;to this whole affair. There has been nary a sign of it from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If some advance is made and some consensus is forged over the Christmas break, this committee will be worth its weight in gold because it will be able to resolve differences which exist at the moment. I am not saying that this committee will be that successful, but it is worth a try because the consultative process that this government embarked on at the outset was a joke. During the debate, there was not sufficient time for adequate consultation to take place. The coalition received submissions from a variety of Aboriginal groups, but I do not pretend to say that those submissions covered the whole spectrum of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander thinking in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aspect of the request involving the extra $3 million is an important aspect which needs to be included with this reference so that there can be some form of comment on it. I notice that we have been criticised for not resolving the question of the request today. If we had, it would not have been able to have been included in the terms of reference. It is one of those matters on which there should be further consultation. I would like to hear what people have to say about having administration costs capped at a certain amount. I would like to hear what the wider community has to say about how we can contain administration costs, how we can stop them from eating away at the taxpayers' dollar, which is supposed to find its mark in the form of land fund acquisition, social welfare or defence spending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The all too frequent criticism throughout this country today is that the purpose for which we allocate and appropriate moneys is always neglected at the expense of bureaucracy and high administrative costs. I would like to have some feedback on that very question. I would like to have some feedback on the question of the $3 million per annum and how it could adequately cater for the administration for which it is intended. I would like to see what people think about individual grants being made, in that there is no requirement to be a corporation. I am confident that that would be well received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that a great many coalition amendments would be well received by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I have no problem with taking them to the people. I have no problem with standing by the amendments that we have proposed during this lengthy debate. Nonetheless, there would be great value in embarking on this democratic process&mdash;if we dare to call it that&mdash;going to the people and finding out what they want. These days it seems as though that is just a tactic to avoid the passing of a bill which the government does not want to pass anyway, or some tactic to avoid a double dissolution. I have already covered those points. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I say to the Senate that there is too much division and too much confusion about the land fund bill in the wider Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community not to have a reference such as this. It is a well balanced reference. It represents the structure of this Senate. The terms of reference which Senator Campbell outlined are wide; they are encompassing. They cover all the aspects which need to be looked at. They cover the question of disagreement among some Aboriginal people about these amendments. As reported today in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, government ministers were of the opinion that fresh negotiations and consultations with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities should be undertaken to diffuse those divisions that I have mentioned, and that some attempt must be made to reconcile those differences. As outlined in the body of this reference, the committee would look at the amendments and test them to see whether they achieve what they set out to do. In the process of that, the bill will be tested. </PARA>

The alternative is that we simply have a stand-off between those who support the amendment and the government, which opposes it&mdash;a stand-off which gets nobody anywhere.

Is that what the opposition means by exhaustive consultation? What are the qualities that add up to exhaustive consultation in its view?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond to some of the statements that have been made and also to speak in support of the setting up of this committee. I disagree very strongly with Senator Kernot's accusation that this is a delaying tactic on the part of the opposition. I concur with the opposition's statement that, if it were, there would be a longer time frame. I would also be delighted to support a longer time frame because it would allow for consultation. However, I think it is important that it not be able to be called a delaying tactic, and a date has been set that will allow the government to proceed without delay. Therefore, it is a very constructive motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also perfectly appropriate to be putting this committee proposal prior to the third reading vote. It is the only appropriate point at which to put a proposal for a committee that is going to give effect to Senator Evans's comments regarding the effects of the amendments to the bill as debated in the Senate on the workability of the bill. It would be too late if we put it at any other time. It has to be prior to the third reading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that it be prior to the third reading vote because, if the third reading vote were to go ahead and the bill were to be rejected in its entirety, it would be far too late to think about setting up a committee to ascertain whether that was an appropriate move in response to the government's unwillingness to look at any of the amendments in a serious and sensible way. It is also appropriate to consider this committee proposal prior to voting on pressing the request because in that way the request can be included in the analysis of the Senate debate by the committee and by Aboriginal groups in the community as to whether its impact has rendered the government's bill unworkable&mdash;and that is the government's term, not mine&mdash;or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the need for consultation is clear. It was clear at the time of the native title legislation debate that insufficient consultation had gone on throughout the community in Australia regarding the impact of the Native Title Act. It was even conceded by the government that consultation should take place. However, when it was suggested by the Greens that it would be appropriate to refer the bill to the community and to have more time for committee consideration so that Aboriginal people within the community could be consulted, the government scurried around and got its legal and constitutional committee to do three days of hearings in Brisbane, Darwin and Perth as a way of preventing a delay to the bill. That is the consultation that Senator Evans referred to when he talked about `after all the consultation entailed in the Native Title Act'. He sounded so sincere and genuine about that three days of public hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember well the words of the government: `Don't worry. If we get this legislation up, if we get the native title legislation passed, we will consult widely and properly before the land fund section is set up.' Now what do we hear? `Because we had such adequate'&mdash;and again I use government terminology, not my own&mdash;`consultation at the time of the native title debate, we do not need any more now.' At least I am glad not to hear the government say, `Don't worry. We will have plenty of consultation prior to the social justice package.' I am afraid that, on the record of this government, that would have to be laughed out of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we were promised consultation for later on down the track in many flourishing words by the government, but it has not eventuated. The Aboriginal community did not understand the government's legislation about this land fund, the ATSIC Indigenous Land Corporation bill, when it was presented. Even some of the people who made the so-called agreements with the government did not see the legislation in its final form or have any idea of the amount of money which&mdash;and there is consensus across the Aboriginal community in Australia about this&mdash;is not sufficient to address the purpose of the bill. Nobody was aware of the framing of this legislation and the way in which it would incorporate in such a deceitful manner the pretence of being a $1.4 billion fund when in reality it delivers only $24 million a year extra forever to Aboriginal people. Over 10 years they will never receive more than $450 million. </PARA>

When we received the final form of this legislation, we wrote to every single person who had written to us at the time of the native title debate either urging us to support the bill or urging us to vote against it. We gave them the details of this land fund bill. We gave them our concerns and our amendments. We wrote to all the ATSIC regional councillors with the details of the bill and with our concerns and amendments and we have received letters and phone calls back. We have received a thick file of support for our amendments. We have received five letters that support the government's legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of those positive letters we have received have also been sent to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to Senator Evans and to Senator Kernot. I know because I just sat here a minute ago taking out the duplicate copies that had been sent to the Prime Minister and other interested senators about it. We know that the Aboriginal community did not know enough about this legislation. They had no idea that the opposition and the Greens and Senator Harradine in the chamber would support sufficient amendments that they could feel more comfortable about the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we are talking about consultation&mdash;I am sorry that Senator Evans is not in the chamber&mdash;Senator Evans assured us that consultation has continued. I had a question for him. I wanted to ask Senator Evans: with whom did he discuss the government's position on the seven Senate amendments that he considered unworkable prior to your speech in the Senate on 16 November? We had a diatribe from the minister about the seven deadly sins&mdash;not about the other 50 amendments but simply about the seven which the government considered unworkable. I ask him: whom did he consult about that? I believe that the task of this committee is a perfectly legitimate task which follows Senator Evans's speech in the Senate about the six amendments and the one request which he considers render the government's legislation unworkable. That needs to be proved. It needs to be taken to consultation. It is utterly appropriate that a committee be set up to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is really concerned about the workability of this legislation, why is it unwilling to support a committee which will canvass those amendments and that request and seek to improve the legislation for those whom the government avows are the potential beneficiaries of this land fund?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans says that the government wants the bill passed. That was a very touching part of his speech, I felt. But he was not quite accurate. The government wants the bill passed unamended, as presented in the House of Representatives. It has shown no commitment whatsoever to passing the bill because it has failed on two counts. It knew right from the beginning, even before the bill entered the House of Representatives, that if it had addressed the miserable quantum of the amount that it was dealing with in its legislation it could have had the two other votes from the Greens that it has not been able to get. If it had been able to address that quantum, not to 10 times the level as proposed, which the Greens put up as an amendment and which was rejected, but in any form whatsoever, it could have had the support of the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about $3 million? It would not even raise by $3 million a year the amount that it had allocated for administration. Then it shamefully admits that it does not want to cap the administration funding. So it will not make it extra on the acquisition of management. It does not want to restrict it. It does not mind how much it eats into the paltry amount that it is setting aside. So for a start the government has not demonstrated any political will whatsoever to have this legislation passed. All it needed to do was address the concerns of the Greens, who in philosophy support the rhetoric of the Prime Minister&mdash;which I might add the bill does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if it did not want to do that, it was on a very good wicket if it had simply treated the opposition with less disrespect and contempt at the point at which the bill reached the House of Representatives. It was the Greens' position at that point&mdash;and we made it public&mdash;that the amendments put forward by the opposition were compatible with the legislation as put forward by the government. I must congratulate the government at this point. If all this agonising debate between the House of Representatives and the Senate has been either a deliberate or even an unconscious attempt by the government to obtain a bipartisan stance of the two major parties on Aboriginal affairs, it has succeeded. Congratulations to the government. By its legislation it has presented something which the opposition, the Liberal and National parties, are much closer to passing than the Greens are. The government knows that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, if the government did not want to increase the amount by one skerrick because of its reverence for the budget deficit, which would be minimally put out by 10 times the amount the government has allocated to Aboriginal people, if it were so reverent towards the budget deficit that it could not look to the Greens for support, it has got it there in the amendments that were presented and worked on in a very conscientious and open form in the debate in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I am saying is that the credibility of this government hangs on its $3 million. If it is not prepared to move $3 million extra on this fund, it is not prepared to move anything. It is very important that its credibility should be on the public record, and it so adequately demonstrated it. Tell that to the Aboriginal people. Tell the Aboriginal people they come from spaceships if they want more than $21 million a year. Tell the Aboriginal people of this country that $21 million a year extra, eaten into by administration funding, is going to meet the needs of the dispossessed over the last 200 years. If the government tells them that, then I will be happy to accept the same criticism that it applies to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that there is very close to a bipartisan stance on the passage of this bill. I do not support it, because I think it is a disgraceful bill. To use the words of Senator Evans when he was speaking to the point of order, I think that Senator Evans became a perpetrator for his government of a disgraceful and dishonest act when he brought this bill before the chamber. The government has been guilty of a dishonest tactic by presenting a bill and then refusing to accept the democratic voice of the bicameral system. It has refused to accept any amendments; it has made it patently obvious that it will not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we had had a really honest vote at the third reading, how would the government voted? We have already heard Senator Evans's speech when he closed the debate and we passed the request across to the House of Representatives. He indicated that the amended form in the Senate was not adequate and not appropriate. I wonder whether Senator Evans was going to vote at the third reading stage to support the passage of the bill, including the amendments of the Senate. If he were, he would be supporting the amended bill. What hypocrisy! If he is prepared to support the amended bill, he should be able to see that it is perfectly appropriate that, when his government in the other place rejects those amendments, we should go to a committee process and we should assess who is right&mdash;the Senate or the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate has improved the bill. We know that because the opposition and the Greens have been speaking for Aboriginal people in the amendments we have made. We do not say for a moment that the government has not also been speaking for Aboriginal people. The point we are making is that the government's legislation does not speak for all concerns and to all people. Referring the legislation to a committee would be an opportunity to address the government's neglect of those people who feel they have not had a voice in the process. They all, even those who support the government's position, deserve a hearing and a committee would provide that to them. For that reason, the Greens support the motion moved by the opposition to set up a committee to look at this very important matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been statements made by Senator Evans&mdash;they were followed up by, I think, Senator Kernot&mdash;raising a question about the motives of the opposition in moving this amendment. These were based on a perceived fear that there was an attempt by the opposition to defer this matter so that it could not become a trigger for a double dissolution. Anybody with an ounce of commonsense or anybody with any knowledge of the constitution would have known that failing to pass the bill could set the time clock running. This has been commented upon by Senator Ellison. Of course members of the opposition would have known that. They did not come down in the last constitutional shower.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senators will remember that that bill was defeated on 9 November. If the government wants a double dissolution trigger so badly, it can bring that back to us at the end of February. We will then no doubt reject it, because that bill is a violation of three very important principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, that bill is a violation of the principle of certainty before the law. I might just remind the Senate of what the bill did. It was an attempt by the government to overturn a decision by the court that certain Cambodian refugees were illegally detained by the government. The judge said that they were illegally detained. The bill says that they were not illegally detained by the government. That offends against the principle of certainty before the law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly has something to do with the argument advanced by Senator Evans as to the motives of the opposition. That all falls to the ground. So let us just look at the genuine concern that was expressed by Senator Kernot that maybe this was introducing a new process. If there were amendments made by the Senate and by the parliament to particular laws before those laws are finally enacted&mdash;in other words, before the third reading takes place&mdash;perhaps this sets a precedent for doing it in those particular cases.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure is about providing a modicum of justice and a modicum of acknowledgment that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have been dispossessed. Dispossessed! This is a unique piece of legislation because it gives the parliament a unique opportunity to do something about it. We want to get it right. That is why we spent so much time in this chamber. As Senator Chamarette has said, the government did not undertake the depth of consultation that it should have. How can it simply reject the request? There has been no real explanation for that. As I understand it, there has been no consultation in depth by the government before it decided to reject that. As I said, it was done in a cavalier approach in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am conscious of the fact that a lot of these amendments were carried by a bare majority of the chamber. But that is why it is even more important to vote for the proposition now put by Senator Campbell with reference to the views of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. What is the government afraid of with this particular reference? The reference seeks to find out whether, taken as a whole, the amendments and request achieve the aim of making the bill a more effective instrument to assist those Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders who will be unable to assert native title rights and interests to acquire land and manage it effectively. I would certainly like to hear what these groups and individuals are saying about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated, this is a unique opportunity for the parliament to do something about dispossession. We have to get it right. It is no good for the government to say, `No, these seven major amendments are totally unacceptable.' How does it know they are totally unacceptable in general to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people? Let the consultations take place and give the people an opportunity to say whether or not the amended bill, taken as a whole, is acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could go on at considerable length. I feel quite strongly about this matter. I fear that, had our requests been pressed, the government would have just ditched the legislation. That is what I understand the government was prepared to do&mdash;ditch it, even with the amendments that it had agreed to. That is not acceptable behaviour by a responsible government in a matter of such importance as this which deals with the question of the dispossession of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. I think this is a further opportunity and I congratulate Senator Campbell for raising it and for moving for referral to a committee. I do not believe it was politically motivated. As I said, that was a straw man that was first put up by Senator Evans and it has been shot to pieces. </PARA>

The government knows that as well as I do, as well as anyone does who knows a bit about the constitution. It could even hold an election on 1 April. I think that is the earliest date on which it could hold it. Looking at this objectively, I feel that it is a positive proposal and I am going to support it. </PARA>

The statement was made by Senator Chamarette that the government does not speak for all Aboriginal people. I have never heard the government suggest that it ever did.

Gulling the Western Australian Greens is one of the few elements of pleasure left to members of the opposition these days.

I might add that they not only support it but have expressed great concern about the terrible things the government was saying about the opposition, which Senator Chamarette wanted to defend the opposition from.

That will be the result of it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage, I do not think we should mince words any longer in here&mdash;and I have certainly heard a lot of pious claptrap uttered during this debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at one of the seven deadly sins that Senator Gareth Evans rightly referred to: the question of dispossession.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Does anyone have any doubt as to whom that is designed to discriminate against? I do not, and neither do the people in the Northern Territory whom it will discriminate against. This particular proposal talks about people who will be unable to assert native title rights. The only native title rights that have been determined to this point in time are of those people who own the island of Mer in the Torres Strait. That is the only case that has been determined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we know about native rights, or what can we assume from the judgment of the High Court may well be the case, particularly in northern Australia? Native title rights may well be found by a court not to actually involve proprietorial rights over land. It may well be&mdash;and it is for a court to determine at some future time&mdash;that the coexistence argument which is mounted, that the caveats that exist in Western Australian and Northern Territory legislation on leases that provide for the use but not the ownership of land, may well be found to be valid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is Senator Chamarette suggesting&mdash;not that the opposition would care, so I address the concern to her&mdash;that an Aboriginal person or group who actually successfully manage to assert their native title rights should then be disbarred or discriminated against in terms of a bias written into the act; that because they have native title rights they should not then have the opportunity to actually own some land? I would not like to think that, but that is what a great many Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory whom I know think&mdash;and they are the only Aboriginal people that I have ever presumed to advance an opinion on behalf of.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is certainly the view they will have of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I am suggesting is that it is not as simple as Senator Chamarette might think.

What an impossible task Senator Chamarette and the opposition have set for that organisation. People would spend the rest of their lives in court with arguments every inch of the way. Even in the Northern Territory&mdash;in the Top End of Australia where certainly among traditional Aboriginal people the question of land ownership generally is more clearly defined than anywhere else in Australia&mdash;debates, discussions, brawls, arguments and fights have been going on for years inside the land councils about traditional ownership, about who is on the list and who is not on the list. In the Northern Territory&mdash;a part of Australia where many Aboriginal people in fact maintain a significantly traditional lifestyle and where living Aboriginal people have encyclopaedic knowledge about relationships with other Aboriginal people and the ownership of land&mdash;we still have those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know what will happen in practice. It might be an esoteric academic exercise for some of the people who have participated in this debate, but over the years I have sat through land council hearings and heard separate groups of Aboriginal people represented by separate fleets of lawyers argue about who is telling the truth about dispossession or not. To set up such a proposal for the whole of Australia would a very difficult proposition indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could the government ever support that? There are thousands of Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, like Tracker Tilmouth, who know that this is designed by the lobbyists who have Senator Chamarette's ear&mdash;and I know who they are&mdash;to discriminate in favour of them and against Aboriginal people elsewhere. Does Senator Chamarette think that they will ever agree at the end of this process at the end of January to this amendment, if we accept it&mdash;and it is one that Senator Chamarette and the opposition have asserted is central to their concerns, and one the government has asserted is central to its concerns&mdash;and say, `That's fine now; we'll just abandon the positions that we held on this up to this point in time.

While he was heckling and making jibes at me, there was no intent on my part to answer him. The only answer I gave was simply to point out that the reason for the request was a very clear one: I supported the request for $3 million more to quarantine the administrative costs away from the acquisition and management aspects of the fund in order to test the government's credibility and to put on the public record its political will as to how much it cared about the Aboriginal people who were supposed to be the avowed beneficiaries of the funds.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my speech earlier today I indicated that I believed there were farm families who would not benefit from the health care card amendment but who would benefit from a 100 per cent discount of farm assets under the Austudy assets test. This is the information that Senator Boswell and others were seeking and I think this will enable him to vote now for our amendment. I am now in a position to give the committee some more detailed information as to just who these families are. Contrary to concerns raised before, they are by no means high income earning families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the income test on the health care card is such that a family with one child can earn up to about $19,400 a year and still qualify for the card, while a family with two children can earn up to about $21,200. These limits are sudden death thresholds, meaning that if a family earns $1 over these amounts, it receives no health care benefit at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test on Austudy, however, is more generous. The threshold for full rate Austudy is $21,300, but the claimant has a gradual withdrawal rate of $1 for every $4 of income over this threshold. Further, the Austudy income test is based on what is known as adjusted family income, which allows additional concessions for any other dependent children. This means that any farming family who, if not for the assets test, would qualify for part rate Austudy payment, will benefit from my 100 per cent discount amendment but will gain nothing from the health care card amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me give an example. A family with two children on an income of, say, $25,000 would not qualify for a health care card and, as such, would have its assets included in the Austudy assets test. Therefore, that family would probably be excluded from Austudy. If our 100 per cent discount amendment were accepted, however, this same family would qualify for a part payment of Austudy of around $100 per fortnight if the child was living at home or $190 per fortnight if the child was living away from home. So all of those farm families with incomes between $21,000 and $45,000 would benefit from my amendment by receiving a part rate payment of Austudy. These families would gain nothing, however, from the health care card amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us not forget that the only reason these people are not currently getting Austudy is their farm assets. Most city folk with incomes between $21,000 and $45,000 are already receiving part Austudy payments. In other words, there is a differential again between city and farm families. To provide true equity for our farm families, both the health care card amendment and my amendment providing a 100 per cent discount for farm assets under the Austudy assets test should be supported. </PARA>

The government clearly opposes the opposition's amendment, which has the support of the Democrats and I think probably the independents as I am getting the nod that we are going down. We are getting that sinking feeling. We strongly oppose the amendment that has been moved by the opposition as outlined in detail by Senator Hill. I do not intend to speak for long because in my concluding remarks at the second reading debate stage I dealt with some of the claims relating to this matter.

It is important, because the student is left with the onus of determining when full-time education has ceased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want a definition of the cessation of full-time education. Is it consistent with the definitions in Austudy, Australian tax, and the other definitions that students have to subject themselves to? I would have thought that, if a definition had been handy, my question would have been easily answered. It seems to me that fundamental to the whole notion which underpins this piece of legislation is the definition of the cessation of full-time education. Is there such a definition in this legislation? If not, which definition will be accepted? Is it a definition which is consistent with the definition of the Australian Taxation Office or with the definition which is provided under Austudy?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter is very important, because the onus is upon the students concerned to fill out a form to say when they ceased full-time education. Some of these people may be seeking to enter full-time employment without having made a permanent decision to cease full-time education. We know that, in general, university students finish their study, for all practical purposes, in November. Many of them attempt to gain work in December, but they may change their minds and resume full-time education the next year. Nobody can be absolutely certain that they have passed their exams and fulfilled all the requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other definitions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That presents the students with some degree of difficulty. The student is not necessarily proving what is the tax office's definition. The student has probably been in receipt of Austudy and has been operating under the auspices of those offices. It is quite silly of the government to expect a student to be able to fill out a form and answer the question, `When did you cease full-time education?'. The student is entitled to say, `What do you mean?' If no advice is forthcoming from the parliamentary secretary at this moment, that leaves some degree of uncertainty about the whole bill.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would argue that it is pretty self-evident when a person ceases full-time study: when they are no longer enrolled in full-time study. It is easily checked, it is easy to verify. People are either enrolled in full-time study or they are not.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a very good start. If you are not enrolled, you are not enrolled in full-time education. The student then has to consider the following: `I may not be enrolled in December and I may not enrol in January, expecting that my results will be all good. But I may re-enrol in February.' If the student is fortunate enough to gain employment in December and January, during what I have previously described as the carnival period in Australia&mdash;which is very good for employment of recent graduates in terms of catering and entertainment&mdash;will the tax office take the HECS pro rata payments out of those earnings at that time on the assumption that the student is going to pass? How many assumptions can it make and get right? In the past, how many people have assumed that they will pass and been wrong?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has again illustrated how far away from reality it has progressed. The answer from the parliamentary secretary about enrolment is a part answer, it is a good start. But, again, it ignores what really happens out there.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have before us today the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994. I would like to briefly summarise some key aspects of this bill and comment on them as I go through. Essentially, the main bill is designed to establish the income support component of the youth training initiative. This provides for the payment of the youth training allowance to young unemployed people under the age of 18 and replaces the jobsearch allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that this 267-page bill was introduced into the House with very little time for analysis. I do not think it reflects very well on this government that such an important bill should have been thrown into the parliament with limited time for consideration in the other place. However, it is somewhat of a compliment that the government should have picked up the coalition's concept of a training wage on which we campaigned very strongly at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the coalition, we believe it is very important that young people get on-the-job training and opportunities for experience and skill acquisition. It is also appropriate that people without experience or training should not be paid at the same level as someone with many more years in a career. However, where we are critical of this government is that it provides for training programs but has done little or nothing to ensure that there are jobs at the end of all these training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate the questions asked by Dr David Kemp in the other place regarding training. What kind of training will these young people be receiving? Will this training be appropriate to their needs? Will there be a connection between these training programs and the real life job market? Furthermore, what is the use of young people receiving training without the labour market reforms that are necessary to give business the incentive to employ more people? Young people in Australia today are cynical enough about the political process without needing to receive more platitudes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Youth organisations were extremely critical of the government's white paper. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 16 May 1994 reported that a summit of youth organisations in Canberra which met to discuss the white paper concluded that the `policy statement is not going to deliver the jobs that the government had promised'. They said the training program was meaningless without job creation. I would have to agree with that. The Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition was critical of a lack of job creation initiatives and the government's concept of case management, among other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These training programs will act as a smokescreen for the real numbers of unemployed youth in the community. The government will claim that it has reduced the unemployment figures when all it has done is fiddle the figures to make it appear that there are fewer people on dole queues. If the government does not want to hear these criticisms from the coalition, let me reiterate my earlier comments by quoting the National Union of Students welfare officer, Edwina Hanlon, who said that graduate unemployment was a growing concern because the biggest group of unemployed people was the 22- to 24-year-olds. Ms Hanlon said that these people were being trained and educated but were not getting jobs at the end of the line. So that does not hold out much hope for 16- and 17-year-olds who go into training programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 5 May 1994, headed `Teenagers' cynicism reaches danger level', stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Youth workers fear widespread youth unemployment has bred a generation of cynics and caused social and economic problems that will haunt the nation for decades . . . According to the chairman of the Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition, Mr Paul Turley, young Australians showed `an understandable but dangerous level of cynicism.'</PARA>
<PARA>Academics are also numbered among critics of the government's dismissive attitude towards our young people. The same article reports that Mr John Freeland, senior lecturer in social work and social policy at the University of Sydney, said that the country would be paying for the effects of youth unemployment for 40 years. Mr Freeland said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you leave up to 20% of your young people feeling cynical and hopeless and resentful of society you could have long term social problems and you could have long term economic costs.</PARA>
<PARA>He warned that the young unemployed were at risk of failing to make a successful transition to secure employment and of spending their lives on the margins of society. For some, this would mean homelessness, petty crime, prostitution and substance abuse. For Mr Turley, the solution was not simply to provide more training, as this bill sets out to do, but to create more work, which the government has not done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Young people have been demoralised by the high unemployment rate in this country. The lack of opportunities and the lack of vision have had devastating effects on many of our youth and contributed to a real sense of hopelessness for many. The UNICEF report of 1994 called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Progress of Nations</EMPHASIS> stated that Australia has the sixth highest youth suicide rate of the industrialised countries. Analysis published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medical Journal </EMPHASIS>and reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> newspaper on 7 February 1994 has revealed that young Victorian men living in areas of high unemployment are more likely to commit suicide than those in regions where the jobless rate is lower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, Professor John Tiller of the department of psychiatry of the University of Melbourne was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 7 February this year as saying that regional data associating the suicide rate to geographical distribution was available only for recent times, so it was not possible to track the trends over a decade. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We're saying that certain high areas of unemployment are associated with high suicide rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Other research has also found that alarming numbers of Victorian teenagers are deliberately hurting themselves in ways that could cause serious injury or death. Obviously other factors are associated with suicide and suicidal tendencies. I am cognisant of the importance of not making black and white statements when, in many instances, there are a whole host of other reasons that lead young people to be suicidal. However, giving young people job opportunities and futures to look forward to, rather than years on dole queues, would take away from some of the other stresses in young people's lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of proposals in this bill raise questions about the overlap between functions of different departments. I am concerned that they may cause some confusion to people on the scheme. There are already a multiplicity of youth support schemes that are becoming increasingly complex for people to understand. Those most in need are more likely to give up on the bureaucratic nightmare that they have to deal with. I instance some of these overlaps and complex areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Employment, Education and Training will be responsible for the policy and administration relating to the youth training initiative, including the youth training allowance. It will also conduct the activity tests for youth training allowance recipients. On the other hand, youth training allowance clients will deal directly with the Department of Social Security on payment matters and the Department of Social Security will have the power to collect relevant information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The administration and policy of the youth training allowance will reside with DEET, and DSS will continue to undertake proof of identity, residence and other eligibility checks related to the youth training allowance and the youth homeless allowance. DEET will continue to undertake all assessments relating to the Austudy and the student homeless rate of payment. It will also provide guidelines and delegational powers to the Department of Social Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will admit that there has been some streamlining of some criteria, and we would support this. For example, the eligibility criteria for qualifying for the homeless rate of the youth training allowance will be the same as that of Austudy, and greater commonality will be established between the parental and personal income and assets test for the youth training allowance and Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in relation to the other changes, it has been suggested that there is no need for this bill and that the Social Security Act should have been amended. It has been stated by some critics that this process is particularly wasteful in that it creates nothing new but merely shuffles over a scheme to another department at some cost and some procedure. I refer to comments by the Welfare Rights Centre:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The enactment of the current Bill would lead to even more complexity and accessibility problems. This is particularly the case given the client group who because of their age&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, 16 to 17 years of age&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">already have great problems of access. Their advisers are more likely to have the social security act and guidelines. Now they will have to refer to another piece of legislation, which in most respects repeats the Social Security Act. However, they will never be sure where the differences exist&mdash;and, with the passage of time (and legislation), inconsistencies will invariably emerge.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer also to the discussion paper issued by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DEET's infrastructure would appear to require substantial improvement in order to be able to offer a comparable service to that undertaken by the Department of Social Security in this area. This leads to the question as to why a duplicate income security administrative structure should exist in the Department of Employment, Education and Training when this already operated in the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA>Given the experience with Austudy, this criticism may have some validity. This bill puts great pressure on ensuring that relations are at a very efficient level between the Department of Social Security and the Department of Employment, Education and Training. I endorse Dr Kemp's comments that we would not want to see loopholes and gaps developing through which people can fall that have occurred in the past when more than one department was involved in the administration of such schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's amendment to this bill proposed, as the result of an inquiry by the House of Representatives standing committee that I have just mentioned, to amalgamate the Student Assistance Review Tribunal with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The committee was strongly critical of the Student Assistance Review Tribunal, which is for students who believe the Department of Employment, Education and Training has made a wrong decision in relation to their Austudy payments, as compared to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, which is for people who believe that the DSS has made a wrong decision in relation to their social security payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Student Assistance Review Tribunal is not widely known by clients. It is relatively inaccessible from rural areas and it takes much longer to hear appeals, but I suggest to the government that serious consideration should be given to the appropriateness of this appeals mechanism in terms of its resources, its responsiveness and its administrative expertise. The House of Representatives committee added:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are aware that the appeals process should be integrally related to the legislative basis of payment. The confusion about the legislation and policy residing in one department, Employment, Education and Training, yet administered and operated through delegation to another (the Department of Social Security), adds another dimension to the unsatisfactory nature of these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>There have been complaints by the National Union of Students about this proposal. I understand that the National Union of Students is not adamantly opposed to the legislation or the amalgamation but has a number of concerns about the detail of the changes. Those concerns are that the proposed change does not provide for student representation on the new tribunal, which it believes is vital, that the new tribunal will have Department of Employment, Education and Training officers as full members of the tribunal, which it believes could lead to a conflict of interest, and that overpayment decisions under the Student Assistance Act will be reviewable by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal on the same basis as Social Security Act overpayment decisions, with the exception that the provision for waiving debts which are not cost-effective to recover will only apply to debts under $50 and not to debts under $200, which is the case for debts under the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to consider the initiatives for case management contained in this legislation, which is part of the youth training initiative. Although it is not specifically covered under this bill, I would like to note a number of concerns with the scheme. It is appalling that 82,000 people are still waiting to be case managed, which is an enormous number of people in fairly dire straits who are not receiving the attention in the form of case managers that they were promised. It is completely unfair that the expectations of the unemployed would be raised in this way beyond what is being delivered. These figures indicate that there is absolutely no guarantee that everyone unemployed for 13 weeks will get a case manager. The whole case management scheme is likely to prove to be very expensive and very inefficient. There is likely to be confusion for youth training allowance recipients between having a case management activity agreement and a youth training activity agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other concerns regarding case management which I will not go into detail about here but suffice it to mention that these concerns are about the amount of time each case manager actually gets to spend with his or her client and whether or not each client will have the undivided attention of his or her case manager as well as the way clients are notified as to whether there is an interview opportunity or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for inquiry. It was decided by the majority of the committee not to undertake hearings into the bill. Senator Tierney and myself recorded a dissenting report on behalf of the coalition as we believed it would have been beneficial for the bill to have been referred to the committee for further evidence to have been taken. The Australian Youth Policy and Action Coalition supported the coalition's view on this matter and said it would have welcomed an opportunity to comment on the youth training allowance. It further commented:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the unveiling of Working Nation in May 1994, there has been no parliamentary hearing or other similar forum to solicit public comment on the numerous initiatives contained in the White Paper.</PARA>
<PARA>It is disappointing that the government has not felt it necessary to investigate public concerns with this bill. As I said at the start of my speech, not only the substantive part of this bill but also the government amendments were very late in coming to the chamber. But the coalition has no wish to delay the passing of this bill in view of the benefits offered to young people seriously seeking employment. So we will not be opposing this bill. However, I believe that the comments I have made serve to highlight the problems associated with it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The white paper changes&mdash;what is known as the Working Nation statement&mdash;have been hailed as a miracle cure for unemployment and education training needs in this country. That is all very well and good but there are a few unanswered questions and more outstanding problems with the package of bills before the Senate. We will be dealing with them in the form of the youth training allowance and employment services legislation. I mentioned in a press release recently that there has been little discussion and analysis of these changes. Senator Troeth I must agree with very strongly&mdash;I congratulate her for the way she expressed it&mdash;in that the government seems to think that it is good enough to just state that there was an extensive period of consultation leading up to the white paper. It is worse than the government starting to believe its own publicity; it is a case of the publicity being put there in place of any reality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where have the opportunities been for young people and students, for the welfare and lobby groups to air their concerns and ask questions and to modify the intentions of the government? I have not seen them and the people who represent and work with young people concerned by this legislation have not seen them either. The Democrats endeavoured to provide such an opportunity by inviting groups such as ACOSS, APEC, NUS and the Welfare Rights Centre to let us know the impacts of these changes. Last Monday we had a round table conference to which we invited those groups. It was enlightening and effective. We listened to their concerns. Our amendments and the questions that I would ask of this bill reflect their suggestions as well as our concerns on a policy basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress that the biggest concern that these organisations have with this piece of legislation is the fact that there has been little time for debate, questioning and representation of the reality to the government. It was with a great deal of disappointment that I saw the government so eager to call off the idea of a committee hearing. A Friday hearing with a few minutes for each group and very little opportunity to question was less than adequate. The attitude of the government was, `We have spoken to somebody from NUS and it is all fixed up now.' I think we will find that it is anything but all fixed up now. We have had a few government amendments and we have had some suggestions taken on the run, but we have not seen an open and thorough consideration of this very important initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training initiative, of which the youth training allowance is an integral part, is in some ways an exciting and innovative scheme. The bill in front of us does set out a noble objective; it seeks to replace the jobsearch allowance with a youth training allowance. In a recent youth options paper it was described as a means of providing work, good pay and job security for young people. The government's focus is on helping young unemployed people by providing a training strategy and education `pathways'&mdash;a wonderful new word, that; I am sure everybody understands what it means. The idea is that, if people follow a certain track and do all the right things, the golden light or great moment of enlightenment will descend upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are no guarantees. Despite talk of activity agreements and negotiation, there does not seem to be any kind of reciprocal arrangement, any assurance that, once young Australians have gone along that pathway, jumped through the requisite hoops, behaved themselves and done all that is required, they will get a job. Where is the job? Where is the obligation from the government's side? What guarantee does a young person have? This is why we see so much cynicism from young people. We have seen people who have gone through school, done what they were supposed to do, look over their shoulder and find a government which blames them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the previous legislation, which I spent so much time in the last hour or so debating, it was those people who had done all the right things who were being blamed for some sort of debt that the government had. Here again the obligation of the government, its side of the bargain, is being weaseled away from. We do not see enough equivalent responsibility being accepted by the government. In this bill the onus is on young people to comply, to do their bit, and if they fail to do so they are punished. In my party, the Democrats, we accept that there must be some strings attached to the provision of income support or financial benefits in our society, but we do not accept that there is one rule for young people and another rule or set of obligations for the government. That is our reaction to that sort of approach and the mentality behind it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that aside for the moment, there are some outstanding questions. We ask sincerely: what happens to those young people who cannot find a job at the end of the education and training pathways that are provided? Where do they turn to then? How are they defined or described? I think a big part of the problem is that we are so derogatory of the people who do the right thing but find at the end of the day that society has not done its side of the bargain for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question we are left to ask&mdash;and I again agree with Senator Troeth&mdash;is why there is such a level of duplication of the Social Security Act. What is this we are dealing with here? Is it social security, employment, education or training? If the government is so concerned to redefine these young people, to categorise them differently, to reassemble its paradigm, then it would do a lot better than to just give part of the Social Security Act another name. We acknowledge that, as the Welfare Rights Centre has pointed out, everything contained in this bill that relates to the proposed youth training allowance activity agreement process and requirements is currently available under the jobsearch allowance activity agreement process and requirements. So why cart it around and give it a different name? I think it was 260 or 270 pages&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. It was 267 pages of repetitious bureaucracy talk. Why do this to people? Is this a scheme to provide employment for the government printer or something? There does not seem to be a rationale for it at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are most concerned about the level of duplication and replication in this bill. I ask the government quite sincerely why it seeks to contain these changes within new legislation under DEET? Why does it not seek to use current legislative mechanisms already available to the government under the DSS? The answer I have heard is, `It is a different philosophical approach. We have to establish a different set of parameters.' We can accept that as a philosophical statement, but the reality&mdash;I keep talking about the reality&mdash;is that it is another pile of paper that does not do anything that the old pile of paper could not do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to have a focus on education and training, but we would like to think that there was a focus on jobs as well. The government can call it what it likes; it can put a label on it. It can relabel a section of the DSS act if it wants to. It is the government; it can tell people that it is no longer a complete DSS act, that it is all about jobs and training and incorporates those aspects of that legislation. It would not then be seen as transparently labelling something for the sake of getting a new act of parliament; it would be seen as actually making the existing act work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This difference in focus really does not necessitate a different piece of legislation. The existing provisions in the Social Security Act could accommodate the reforms. It is very important both for the coalition and for the Democrats that that point of view is expressed strongly and that the minister is challenged to provide some sort of excuse as to why this is so necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be seeking to amend two sections of this bill. They relate primarily to definitions, but not only to definitions. It is not only the definitions that concern us. We will seek to change the definition of independence for a young person by decreasing the waiting period from 26 to 18 weeks. We do not understand the government's motives in regard to this piece of legislation. In 1992 the government reduced the waiting period from 26 to 18 weeks because it was considered a more appropriate and fair time period. Why then has the government decided now to postpone the waiting period to 26 weeks? In the document <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A national employment and training plan for young Australians</EMPHASIS>&mdash;some senators may remember that document; it was launched after the PM's youth summit in 1992&mdash;the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to problems raised by a number of delegates at the National meeting, the Government is announcing today initiatives to support and simplify&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>remember that word `simplify'-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">income support arrangements for unemployed young people.</PARA>
<PARA>Included in those initiatives was the reduction from 26 to 18 weeks in the time required for income support recipients under 18 to have lived away from home before becoming eligible for the higher independent rate of payment. Now we are going back the other way. That is what the government does&mdash;it consults with young people, changes things and a couple of years later sneaks back its own set-up without consultation. So the youth summit was a worthless exercise. We have had this contradiction now. Anything to do with youth is brought before parliament. Young people are not consulted and the government welshed on the original arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No wonder young people are cynical. No wonder they laugh up their sleeves at the government. In the Democrats' youth poll we found an extremely high percentage of young people who would not even bother to vote for anybody here, because they do not trust any of us. When the government has a youth summit it agrees to give young people an amendment which will affect them slightly, but as soon as their backs are turned and as soon as it is quiet, it takes it away. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This evening I wish to relate my comments to the decision of the Channel 9 television network to screen the program <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on Request</EMPHASIS> at 8.30 p.m. last Thursday, 24 November. The program dealt with the controversial subject of euthanasia. The Dutch documentary followed from, the beginning to the end, an elderly and ill man's decision to terminate his life, with the support of his wife and doctor. Moreover, for the first time on Australian television, an intensely intimate and detailed death scene was shown. Death was brought about by the doctor administering a lethal injection to the frail patient.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Channel 9 executive, Mr Len Downs, conceded on radio that the showing of the death scene in its most complete form was a first for Australian television. Therefore, by Mr Downs's own admission, it is a powerful show that has pushed the boundaries of television censorship to their outer limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is as much against the clear breach of the commercial television industry code of practice and the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 as it is against the principle that the program sought to portray. I make this claim on three grounds. Firstly, the program was wrongly rated M. Rather, it was deserving of the higher classification of MA&mdash;for mature adults. Material classified M, for mature audiences, is recommended for viewing by persons aged 15 years and over. The M classification of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on Request</EMPHASIS> breaches the commercial television industry code of practice. In relation to suicide, that code of practice states that suicide must not be depicted favourably and methods of suicide must not be depicted in realistic detail. On any analysis, the program shows the assisted suicide in realistic detail and on any analysis it is depicted favourably. Certainly, no alternative argument to euthanasia was given television time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet even the M classification did not satisfy the Nine Network chief classification officer, Mr Richard Lyle. Responding to my correspondence on behalf of Channel 9 owner Mr Kerry Packer, Mr Lyle, in a letter dated 24 November, claimed that it could be played even earlier, in a PG time slot of 7.30 p.m. I bring to the attention of the Senate the gravity of Mr Lyle's comments. The PG classification under the voluntary code of practice clearly states in regard to suicide:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The depiction of suicide or attempted suicide must be inexplicit and discreet and must not be presented as a means of achieving a desired result or as an appropriate response to stress, depression or other problems.</PARA>
<PARA>Thankfully, Mr Lyle is bound by some law, by way of the Broadcasting Act; otherwise <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on Request</EMPHASIS> would have sunk to the lowly rating of PG, to be shown at 7.30 p.m. I believe Mr Lyle is employed to apply the law, not to make it up. I question Mr Lyle's competence to be a judge of community standards. I believe his position is no longer tenable because of his abandonment of the accepted code of practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the program was wrongly time slotted. It is only 12 months since the television industry made commitments to a very concerned Prime Minister to adhere to a new code of practice, in particular, the time slotting of adult shows after 9.30 p.m. I quote what the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on Friday, 6 November 1992:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Adult only movies, I think, should be telecast no earlier than 9.30 on an evening, so at least children have got some chance of being protected from it. I just don't think that children or young people in particular, who haven't had enough years to sort of settle their thoughts about these subjects, who have themselves probably never seen, the majority or most have never seen a violent thing happen or killing, to see it as it is now being depicted in sort of what you would call an everyday circumstance of depiction of modern television, well it's too much for a culture to keep absorbing.</PARA>
<PARA>So the television networks have clearly cast aside their glossy commitments they made to the parliament and to the Prime Minister some 12 months ago regarding the slotting of programs. The parliament can no longer trust the word of a television executive when it comes to self-rating or self time slotting of obviously controversial themes like <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on Request</EMPHASIS>. Television stations do not have a licence to subject prime-time family audiences to intrusive and highly personalised footage of the suicide of a human being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, and probably the worst breach of all, was the neglect of the promotions of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on Request</EMPHASIS>. The code of practice is clear about promotions giving adequate prior warning to viewers. Instead of warning viewers, the promotions had virtually boasted about the program's content. In particular, a WIN television press release dressed up the program in controversy and gave no warnings of the intimate death scene to follow. Based on the program's negligent promotions, a viewer, in particular, an elderly person, could be led unsuspectingly to the program's real life death scene and be subsequently traumatised. The programmers have obviously lost sight of the massive influence which the documentary would have on the elderly, the seriously ill and the emotionally unstable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The showing of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Death on Request</EMPHASIS> last Thursday is the clearest indication yet that television executives have lost touch with community opinion and standards. I refer to a poll taken by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> published on Friday, 25 November that showed 54 per cent of people believed that Channel 9 should not have televised the documentary. I am sure a greater number of people would agree, at the very least, that the program should not have been shown in the time slot of 8.30 p.m. Therefore, the television industry has soiled its own nest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A self-regulatory code of practice is no longer an option for a parliament that seeks to be the touchstone of community standards. Television rating should now be placed in the same category as movies, videos and video games and come under the jurisdiction of the Film Censorship Board and its appeal body, the Film and Literature Board of Review. After all, the classifications of M and MA are the same definitions as used by these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, I will be petitioning the responsible minister, the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, and the responsible Senate committee on community standards to consider this matter with the aim of tightening control over loose television executives and their in-house censors. As a matter of course complaints have already been forwarded to the Australian Broadcasting Authority for action. To leave the matter undisputed would be to give television censors the right to send our very fragile standards on a ride into the outer limits. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HX5">Senator WOODLEY</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address an issue that was raised today, and of course we ran out of time in taking note of questions without notice and answers given to them. I particularly want to deal with the Port Hinchinbrook development project. I obtained a large number of documents under the freedom of information legislation which cast some very interesting light on the whole debate which has been going on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues which has been raised is that of the mangrove removal, and particularly this comment by Premier Goss: `Senator Faulkner said he took his action because of his concern about the effect of mangrove removal on the seagrass beds in the World Heritage area. No such concern has been mentioned by anyone during the 10 months of detailed consultation during which the issue of mangrove clearing was specifically discussed.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question was asked today about whom one should believe. Unfortunately, the Premier of Queensland is becoming less and less believable in this debate. I will quote from a number of documents&mdash;obviously, I cannot quote from all of them&mdash;which bear specifically on the issue of mangrove removal. For instance, a letter to Mr K. J. Down, Head of the Office of the Coordinator-General, dated 9 June 1994, from the Director-General of the DPI in Queensland, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maintenance of the large mature mangroves along the foreshore should be considered as providing an environmental feature, enhancing the proposed development. Experience with other coastal developments indicates that removal of mangroves does not necessarily alleviate the problem of insect pests but often leads to a shift in the type of insect pest. Mangroves also provide foreshore stability and contribute to local and regional fisheries productivity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is highly possible that seagrass meadows could be damaged by dredging work and associated turbidity. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seagrasses are vital to the local dugong population. Ensuring their protection should be a minimum requirement.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one letter in which the Premier's own departments discussed the issue of mangroves. I have another memo obtained under freedom of information. It is again to John Down from his own department. It is headed `Port Hinchinbrook&mdash;mangrove issues'. There are a couple of pages on mangroves. The document states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a meeting on 28 February 1994, attended by representatives of DEH and DPI to discuss the report prepared by Cardno &amp; Davies, officers of both departments indicated that they will recommend retention of the mature foreshore mangroves.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely this is a highly significant comment and goes against the Premier's claim that no-one raised the issue of mangroves. Of course, we know that many people outside of the departments did raise the issue&mdash;including scientists, conservation groups and Mr Goss's own staff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have a facsimile message to Jan Bimrose of the Office of the Coordinator-General, this time under the heading `the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority', dated 5 August 1994. Across the letter is written `urgent'&mdash;I presume written by the recipient of the letter. It comes from Mike Bugler, Assistant Director, Environmental Impact Management. This particular document again refers to the mangroves. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Effects of the mangrove removal operation at the beach replenishment site.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is quite possible that (as with the dredging operation) the mangrove removal process (not described in any of the documentation I have seen) could create a substantial turbidity plume and greatly increased sedimentation rates in adjacent areas.</PARA>
<PARA>This whole letter discusses in quite a lot of detail the issue of mangroves. I am afraid that Mr Goss has been badly informed. I imagine that really is the explanation. He says that no concern had been raised by anyone. There is the concern of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, the concern of people within the Office of the Coordinator-General, and the concern of the Department of Primary Industries with the issue of mangrove removal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, among the documents which I received there were a number from Mr Williams himself. I probably will not have time to read the whole of these letters, but again I will comment from them and seek to table them at a later time when I have had time to distribute them. It is also useful, by reading from the letter, to indicate the kind of pressure that Mr Williams applied in seeking to have his proposals granted. In a letter to the Cardwell Shire Council, dated 13 September 1994, Mr Williams wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it is now only your Council that is preventing the project from proceeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If we cannot reconcile the outstanding matters on an amicable and commonsense basis then I intend to proceed in accordance with my existing and valid approvals which will increase the potential guest population of the project to a figure in excess of 2,200.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Publicly your Council will have to bear the responsibility for this and for delivering to the people of Cardwell a project which is vastly inferior to that which my company has submitted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a last attempt to bring sanity to the situation I will draft a letter to all Council members which, if not considered to be acceptable, will double as a press release.</PARA>
<PARA>A facsimile message from the Office of the Coordinator-General&mdash;again from Mr Down&mdash;to Mr Geoff Walsh, Senior Private Secretary, Office of the Prime Minister, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Walsh</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Please find attached a copy of a facsimile message received in this Office today from Mr Keith Williams. The contents of the fax are an example of the extreme pressure we are under. Earlier today I had a telephone conversation with Mr Williams in which he told me he was about to instruct his solicitors to proceed against various Ministers and Senior Executive Officers of the State.</PARA>
<PARA>That message is dated 29 September 1994. Obviously, the state government felt that it was being pressured. It is interesting that the permits were issued the next day. In a further letter to Mr Down of the Office of the Coordinator-General, Mr Williams writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Understandably I have run out of patience and I have had a gut full of waiting for phone calls that seldom eventuate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless I receive ancillary permits . . . and a definite time and date for approval I see no alternative but to take whatever action is appropriate to protecting the value of my assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My proposed "expose everything" media campaign will no doubt include an open offer to the Government to buy the site for public purposes. This amounts to an invitation to the Government to put up or shut up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have already issued instructions to my solicitor to prepare the basis of my case against the Queensland Government and specified individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This morning Robin Potter advised that my best avenue of recourse would be against the Federal Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The Senate can understand the concern I have about the kind of pressure applied particularly to the state government and the Cardwell Shire Council by Mr Williams. It illustrates the kind of way in which this man operates and underlines again the concern that I have about this development, about the whole way in which it has proceeded and certainly about the Premier's claim that there was never any mention of the mangrove removal. The whole thing has been a mess from beginning to finish. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of confessions to make to the Senate. I have had an addiction&mdash;an addiction to sweets and lollies for a number of years. This addiction started when, as a small boy in the small country town of Boonah, I used to go to the local grocery store to get the groceries for the family and always bought threepence worth of lollies. My favourites were hard jubes. I became addicted to them at that stage in life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I lost track of them during my teenage years. But in my early adulthood I discovered some sweets called Marella jubes that were like the old lollies I used to have. They had a very intense fruit flavour. They were very hard and made very good chewing. I have bought a lot of these sweets over the last few years, becoming somewhat addicted to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of years ago, I noticed that the sweets had become softer. They were hard, but not as hard they used to be. This annoyed me. I stopped buying them for a little while, but the flavours took me back to them. So I have put up with what I thought was an inferior quality sweet. I recently thought to myself, `That is not good enough. I am going to write to the company, Nestle Confectionery Ltd, and tell its representatives that they have changed their recipe and that I do not like it. I will suggest that they go back to the hard jubes.' I did accordingly write to the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, I received a response from the company. Part of it says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are correct when you noted that we did, indeed, change our formulation several years ago. The Marella Jubes that you were familiar with were made to a Rowntree (U.K.) recipe, and required several ingredients imported from the U.S. and U.K. In 1991, we developed several recipes using only Australian ingredients, and settled on one after Consumer taste tests. The result was a product which tasted the same, but which, alas, was a little softer.</PARA>
<PARA>First, I want to congratulate Nestle Confectionery Ltd for taking this action. It is good to see companies based in Australia making sure that their products are made from entirely Australian produce. As a person who has made my living out of the sugar industry all of my life and who still lives in a sugar community, I am very pleased to see that a company which uses such a lot of sugar not only uses Australian sugar, which I am sure it always did, but also now uses entirely Australian products in the making of its sweets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that on that basis, and because this is the reason for the change in the recipe, I will have to accept the Nestle Confectionery Ltd new recipes and my Marella jubes being a little softer. The letter that I quoted from went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the changeover, sales have remained healthy, and we can only assume that most of our consumers have accepted the slightly softer Marella.</PARA>
<PARA>So be it. The final paragraph of the letter is the second confession I have to make to the Senate. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am sure that you will be able to develop a taste for the new recipe, and have included several packs of Marella jubes to help you along.</PARA>
<PARA>With that, the company kindly set me this rather exciting looking parcel of Marella jubes, which I have been staring at rather enviously all day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry says, `Pass them around.' I feel a little embarrassed in these days of disclosure and the registration of senators' interests, particularly when in some other parliaments of the world people are being accused of accepting bribes to do certain things. I am a bit worried about that, so I have come to the conclusion that I will not accept the Marella jubes. Fortunately, I am probably in the financial position where I can buy my own in any case. What I will do with these Marella jubes which Nestle Confectionery Ltd has very kindly sent to me is donate them to a charity which benefits children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a good think about which charity I might select. Many deserving charities around Australia support children, particularly disadvantaged children. I have decided that I will make a donation of the Nestle company gift to the Lower Burdekin branch of the Endeavour Foundation. Madam Acting Deputy President, you may be aware that the Endeavour Foundation was formerly called the Subnormal Children's Welfare Association. I think it is an association in Queensland only. However, there are similar associations in other parts of Australia. It is a voluntary organisation which does magnificent work with intellectually disabled people&mdash;not only children&mdash;of all ages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Lower Burdekin branch, which is the branch in my home town of Ayr, has a number of facilities, including a four-bedroom residence at 18 Cox Street, Ayr called `Carinya'. It has another residential place called the Arthur Coburn Residential situated at Groper Creek Road, Home Hill. Eight residents are provided with accommodation in a secure environment there. The Activity Therapy Centre of the Endeavour Foundation in Ayr teaches 17 people social, recreational and life skills. The Clive William Taylor Farm at Home Hill provides employment for 12 intellectually disabled people. I well remember that farm. I am very pleased to say that my legal firm in Ayr was instrumental in getting a cane assignment for that farm many years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also very proud and honoured that the Lower Burdekin branch of the Endeavour Foundation invited me to be patron of its branch. I am very happy and honoured to have accepted that invitation. I will make these Marella jubes available to the foundation the next time that I am in Ayr. Having purged my soul with those two confessions, I think we can now finish the Senate for tonight. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) There is no means of determining exactly how much sawmill waste will be produced prior to milling. However, the Environmental Impact Statement recently completed and publicly released by Sawmillers Exports Pty Ltd, an exporter of woodchips sourced from sawmill waste in northern New South Wales, provides an indication of the utilisation of a typical sawlog from the region. Based on this assessment we could expect one cubic metre of sawlog to yield 0.40 tonnes of sawn timber, 0.45 tonnes of woodchips, 0.25 tonnes of sawdust and 0.10 tonnes of other waste. On this basis it is likely that about 311 000 cubic metres of sawlog timber would produce 140 000 tonnes of woodchips and about 124 000 tonnes of sawn timber.</PARA>

After 2000 the export of woodchips that are surplus to domestic requirements would be considered on a case by case basis.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The fundamentals of Australia's policy in relation to Myanmar have not changed. We maintain the suspension of official bilateral development assistance, the ban on defence exports and the suspension of defence visits from Australia, and our policy to neither encourage nor discourage trade. We also continue to use our best endeavours, in dialogue with the SLORC, in multilateral forums, and in discussion with other countries, notably those in the region, to encourage political reform and respect for human rights in Myanmar. At the ASEAN Post Ministerial Conference in Bangkok in July, three themes which underpin our approach to Myanmar attracted general support:  any progress in Myanmar would be more likely to be achieved through dialogue and engagement by the international community, rather than through confrontation and isolation; "benchmarks" were a useful means of gauging movement; and there should be a relationship between concessions to the SLORC and progress in Myanmar.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The `constructive engagement' policy of the ASEAN countries seeks to integrate Myanmar into regional and broader international processes as a way of exerting a positive influence on human rights and political reform. Australia has strongly encouraged ASEAN countries to use their contacts with Myanmar to send clear signals about respect for human rights and early movement towards a more participative political system in Myanmar and not to grant further `rewards' to Myanmar until significant further progress has been made on the benchmarks. There is evidence that ASEAN governments are aware of their potential influence and that they have been exercising it, a process that we have encouraged.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I would not wish to comment on the content or effectiveness of the Myanmar policy of our ASEAN neighbours, which have the sovereign right to conduct their own external affairs as they see fit. It seems, however, that international opinion does have some influence on the SLORC's approach, and that ASEAN countries have a particular significance in this regard. Recent events in Myanmar give some cause for hope for further positive steps in Myanmar's political evolution. In particular, the meetings between the SLORC and Aung San Suu Kyi on 20 September and 28 October could lead to the commencement of a dialogue of substance on political reform and national reconciliation, which the Australian Government has been advocating for some time.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I meant that pursuing a dialogue with the SLORC, and applying the `benchmarks' approach, could be more effective than isolating and ostracising Myanmar in encouraging political reform and improving the human rights situation in that country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The ASEAN countries characterise their policy as `constructive engagement' with Myanmar. I am not aware of any other countries which describe their policy in these specific terms.</PARA>

The EU actively participates in international efforts to press the Myanmar authorities to improve their human rights performance and to institute democratic and economic reforms. My understanding of current EU policy is that any fundamental change in its relations with Myanmar is unlikely in the absence of significant progress in a number of areas, including in such areas as respect for human rights and political reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) I am not aware of any EU initiative for talks with the SLORC in Myanmar, although EU member countries with  Embassies in Myanmar no doubt maintain contact with the SLORC. Moreover, the EU, represented by Germany, France and Greece, met with Myanmar Foreign Minister U Ohn Gyaw recently in New York to commence a process of `critical dialogue' with the SLORC. I understand that the purpose of the dialogue is to ensure that the SLORC appreciates that the resumption of normal relations between the EU and Myanmar is dependent on improvements in their human rights performance, and progress towards political liberalisation and national reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Our Embassy in Yangon maintains a continuing dialogue with the SLORC, including on human rights and the need to expedite political reform. I have had meetings with Foreign Minister U Ohn  Gyaw, including in Bangkok in July and again at the UN General Assembly in New York in October to sustain the dialogue. However, there has been no specific new Australian Government initiative to begin talks in Myanmar with the SLORC. Senator Hill visited Myanmar in July in a private capacity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) There is a high demand for SBS services from communities across Australia. As limited resources are available to extend SBS television to all areas which have expressed an interest in receiving it, SBS television extensions must be considered on a phased basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">SBS television in Tasmania is provided to communities within the coverage area of the main transmitting stations at Mount Wellington in the South and Mount Barrow in Northern Tasmania which pick up the SBS signal from the Optus satellite.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Translators or retransmitting devices are installed within the main transmitting station coverage area to ensure good reception in places where the topography hinders an incoming signal. Binalong Bay is well outside the Mount Barrow SBS television coverage area. Additional transmission facilities would be required to provide SBS television in the Binalong Bay area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am unaware of any technical obstacle to providing transmission of SBS television to Binalong Bay.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) RAN surface and submarine vessels operating out of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, and all other Australian ports, are required to comply with the regulations outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Maritime Command Orders</EMPHASIS>, which, with regard to ballasting, are derived from the MARPOL Convention. Further, it is a Royal Australian Navy Environmental objective `to prevent infestations by marine pest organisms through the inappropriate disposal of ballast waters.' Additionally, foreign naval vessels arriving from overseas are required to declare if the ship has exchanged ballast water during the voyage, and if it has logbook certification of time and coordinates when reballasting took place; or, if the vessel is part of a compliance arrangement for ballast water control accepted by Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although naval ships are able to ballast water into segregated ballast tanks, they will only do so when either bunkerage or cargo tanks are low. The only occasion for this is in open ocean operations when it may be done as fuel stocks are depleted. There is no reason to embark or discharge salt water ballast in harbour. Ballast water embarked by naval vessels outside Australian waters is discharged prior to entering Australian waters. It needs to be emphasised that naval vessels do not ballast as a matter of course; in fact, ballasting is a relatively rare occurrence.</PARA>
