<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Medicare is working. The funding in Medicare is working.</PARA>
<PARA>How is it that one year out from this reassuring comment by Mr Keating the minister is seeking an increase in the Medicare levy? Will the minister categorically rule out an increase in the Medicare levy in the term of this parliament?</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1465" SPEAKER="Richardson Sen The Hon G.F." NAMEID="4E4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="HEALTH; ENVIRONMENT, SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not within my power to rule in or out any increase in the Medicare levy. I am but a humble health minister so I could not possibly rule it in or out. But that having been said, I take the view that it is not appropriate for me to either confirm or deny any speculation on the budget, and I will not be doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in response to Senator Newman's question, `Is Medicare working?', overwhelmingly and resoundingly I would say, `yes'. Five times in a row Australians have said it was working, and they were right each time. The numbers of them who believe it to be true grow every year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the waiting lists?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us get to the waiting lists. That is a very good question. If we believe that 112,000 were on the waiting lists&mdash;as the AIHW said the other day&mdash;that means that 97 per cent of those who walk in the door of a public hospital in Australia get treated quickly and get treated well; 97 per cent get treated straight away.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, if we look at that figure, we see that only a third of those wait longer than six months; a third of them wait only a couple of weeks. A third of them wait six months or more. The fact therefore is that we are down to one per cent. I would have thought that any system that could deliver for 99 per cent of those who go through its doors is doing phenomenally well. However, I take the view that if there is even one per cent who ought to be treated better we have an obligation to improve the system further and get to them as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, yes, I will be making suggestions to do more in public health so that it is not 99 per cent who get treated well under Medicare but it is 100 per cent. No nation in the world could make the boast about the 99 per cent that we can&mdash;not one. This is the best health system going, but this government, which created it, will now make it better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That stands in stark contrast to the opposition's health policy; we still do not know what it is. Senator Woods, who was the former opposition health spokesman when a member of the House of Representatives, has just been appointed to the Senate. His health policy was ditched last year. The opposition still does not have one. I notice, however, that Senator Bishop is trying to help the opposition out, but we might have more to say about that later today. I am only warming up on this; there is a long way to go.</PARA>

The minister has responded about the promises that he has been making, and the need to do more and spend more in areas like medical research, Aboriginal health and the hospital queues. In order to do that he needs to spend more. Is it not the minister's proposal to spend more and the need for an increase in the Medicare levy the cause of his admission that he would be happy to stand aside to make way for Carmen Lawrence, because he knows he is going to lose the portfolio, and he is only going to put as good a spin on the job as he can possibly put?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="IF4">Senator CHILDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. A recent report has indicated that levels of Australian investment in South-East Asia have been relatively low. Does this mean that Australian companies have not taken full advantage of trade opportunities which exist in the region?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1466" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE; ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been such reports recently, not least because I recently had the opportunity publicly to release a study by the East Asia analytical unit of my department, entitled `Changing tack: Australian investment in South-East Asia'. The report showed, as Senator Childs correctly stated, that, while Australian trade with South-East Asian countries has been growing very strongly over the past decade&mdash;it has made a very significant contribution to Australian economic growth&mdash;the reverse has happened to investment. Australian investors' relative interest in ASEAN countries has fallen throughout the 1980s. There has been a focus instead on Europe and the United States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some very understandable reasons for that, particularly in relation to the 1992 situation in Europe. It is, nevertheless, contrary to one's expectation and an indication that opportunities in the region are being lost. Obviously it is not for the government to decide where to invest. Those are decisions for companies and enterprises, based on their judgments of the commercial factors of any decisions they are making. But the report does highlight that there are opportunities in South-East Asia which may be appropriately considered by Australian business. The reason for initiating the report and for now promoting it is that we want business to consider taking up those opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most important things is that the report, hopefully and I think finally, puts to rest the view that in some way investment overseas&mdash;in this instance, investment in South-East Asia&mdash;costs jobs in Australia. In fact, it makes it quite clear that most Australian investors in South-East Asia source at least some of the inputs for their offshore operations from Australia. So, rather than diverting productive activity from Australia, much of this investment is driving exports, boosting production and creating more jobs in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not in any way a blanket endorsement that every Australian firm should invest in the region. Each one has to make its own judgment on its own circumstances and on the opportunities in front of it. But the clear message is that investment in South-East Asia will be a very important part of Australia's trade and economic strategy collectively and for many of the companies which go to make up the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of recommendations in the report and it is particularly important that they be considered at the Commonwealth-state trade and investment forum scheduled for July. The recommendations are designed to improve information, to assist in the development of networks and to build on Australia's advantages in the region. So I think it is a very important report. It does not provide all the answers, but it raises some issues which are fundamental and central to the development of Australia's trade and economic strategy, particularly in relation to South-East Asia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories explain how almost 20 per cent of the $2.5 million in grants that went to three marginal seats in New South Wales in 1989-90 went to only the seats of Eden-Monaro, Calare and Hunter, representing only six per cent of New South Wales electorates? Is it not true that political bias was the major factor which determined the grants which were awarded under the minister's administration at that time?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think this sounds remarkably similar to the seven questions I was asked on the last day I was in this place. I have a feeling the answer will be very similar to the seven answers I gave the last time I was in this place, which was that we had a number of criteria by which we judged the grants. The marginality of electorates was not among them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had cause to look already, although it requires some more examination, at some of the claims made on that last day. Senator Campbell extended the definition of marginal seats out to 8 1/2 per cent&mdash;I do not know of any political party that ever considered that. I then worked out, knowing how bad those opposite are going, that 8 1/2 per cent is something they have to consider. They have to look at every one of them because they are all in strife. From our point of view, when it came to grants, we looked at a number of criteria. Foremost among them was need.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot remember what Senator Kemp's question was. There is so little worth remembering in Senator Kemp's questions that I cannot recall it. All I can say is that we looked at $13 million worth of grants out of $200 million worth of requests. Senator Tierney could have drawn up a worthy list completely different from mine, as anyone could have. He could have drawn up 10 lists different from mine and still come up with projects that were needed, projects that would have served communities and projects that would have been welcomed by them all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder about what I should say to the people of Hunter, Calare or even Eden-Monaro. Should I say to them that they are not worthy?

I will be especially interested to hear what he says about the grants to the Hunter region. Senator Tierney proclaims a love for that region.

Will the minister not agree that this reaffirms the questions from last time and that, in relation to Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria, he rorted the system back in 1989-90?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment, Education and Training.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1467" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is very pleasing to be able to report that the February employment figures released last week are very good news for the economy but, of course, not very good news for the opposition. The labour force figures released confirm that economic recovery is generating sustained employment growth. During February, the number of full-time jobs rose by 39,800 and total employment increased by 14,400. Employment is now 217,500 higher than a year ago. Unemployment is down by 34,600 over the past year. Employment growth is flowing to both full-time and part-time jobs. It is pleasing that, over the last six months, a clear growth trend has emerged for full-time jobs. In the last six months, full-time employment has grown by 96,900 and part-time employment has grown by 54,500. These are all excellent signs of growth in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further very significant feature of the latest data is that employment for women is at its highest level ever. Job opportunities for women are very good indeed. For the year to February 1994, female employment grew by 104,000, which represents a growth of 3.2 per cent. Female employment is 46,500, or 1.4 per cent, higher than at the peak of the business cycle in July 1990. Female full-time employment has grown by 50,800, or 2.7 per cent, during the past year. Male employment, by contrast, has grown by 3.6 per cent, or 113,000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main factors which explain the improvement in employment for women include an increase in the participation rate and changes in industry structure. The labour force female participation rate has increased by 15 per cent over the decade to 1993-94; that is, it has increased from 44.9 per cent to 51.7 per cent. Industries that have shown this growth, that predominantly employ women and that have grown the fastest are, namely, the community services, recreation, finance, property and business services and retail trade industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant step forward in female employment last weekend was the fact that Carmen Lawrence will now become the federal member for Fremantle. She will do an excellent job. It was a great pleasure to be involved in that campaign. I was able to see how the people of Fremantle put down the smear campaign that some members opposite ran against Carmen Lawrence&mdash;particularly Senator Campbell, who accused her of murdering somebody in Western Australia in the recent past. It was an outrageous smear campaign, which is typical of the opposition's negative policies and negative comments. It ignored the very good news on the economic front, particularly on employment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I advise Senator Kernot to leap upon more contemporary leaks. She is a little out of date with that one. If the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> wishes to publish in March leaks of views which it thinks might have been made last June, it at least needs to get a little more up to date about things that have been said publicly by the Minister for Transport this month.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 4 March this year the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Finance jointly announced a due diligence process for ANL. I am not going to confirm what cabinet decisions may or may not have been made last year, but if there had been one, as reported, that was made in June of 1993, it has been quite clearly superseded by the decision of February this year and announced in March by the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the course of the due diligence process which has been announced, the government will be conducting extensive consultations with the unions, the ACTU and the industry. Once the findings of the due diligence are known, any decision about the ownership structure will once again be undertaken only after consultation with those same parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously the party has a policy on the ANL sale. We will not in any way be pre-empting the processes of party policy in the lead-up to this year's national conference.

It is the government's preference that ANL should continue to play its part in Australian shipping and that it should continue to operate as Australian owned, Australian crewed and Australian flagged with its employees working under Australian award conditions. The outcome of the process will be the product of consultation after the due diligence process and after consideration, as is always the case, of the policy of the party as determined at our national conference.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to answer this question and, in particular, to take another opportunity to debunk some of the continuing myths about sole parents, one of  which is that sole parents somehow arrive as teenage mothers. The facts are the opposite. The majority of parents become sole parents as a result of divorce or breakdown of de facto relationships.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The average age of a sole parent&mdash;this might entertain the Senate&mdash;is about 33 for women and 38 for men. The average number of children of a sole parent pensioner is about 1.8, near enough to two children. The average duration on the sole parent pension is about 3.4 years for women. Many sole parents use the sole parent pension merely as crisis management and a large number give up the pension within three months&mdash;that is, they are on the pension for only three months. Very importantly, teenage sole parents make up only three per cent of sole parent pensioners. That figure is actually down from nine per cent in 1980. That is in line with the trend of declining numbers of teenagers giving birth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been very concerned to see that all social security recipients are assisted. It has three main aims&mdash;adequacy of payments, targeting those most in need, and encouraging people on the pension to move off the pension and to become self-sufficient as soon as possible. The JET program has done that with very great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JET program, as people would know, covers three portfolios: the Department of Social Security, the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the child-care section of the Department of Human Services and Health. It assists sole parent pensioners and their families by providing information and counselling, directing those people to the appropriate training, study or even employment, and arranging child care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program quite clearly has put paid to any notion that sole parents are unmotivated or do not want to get off the pension. In fact, the evidence shows quite the opposite. In the six months from July to December last year, some 7,600 JET clients gained jobs, an increase of around 50 per cent over the same period in 1992-93 and nearly 180 per cent higher than in the same period in 1991-92. It is clear that sole parents participating in JET are getting a good share of the expanding job market to which my colleague Senator Schacht just referred. In addition, nearly 4,200 sole parent pensioners have taken up education and over 12,000 have taken up opportunities to train through a labour market program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The JET program is making a difference in education, training and employment. In fact, the government should feel very pleased with these results because they show, as those figures indicate, that sole parents are motivated and are very happy to take up those opportunities and that government assistance is helping them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best kind of flattery is imitation. New Zealand has just announced that it will trial a new program called Compass, which is based on the Australian JET model. I believe that is something from which we should take great heart.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. It is interesting that when parliament resumed the minister told us that this was last year's issue, yet it seems to have made some ground since then. Is the minister saying to us that, without any consultation with senior ministers&mdash;or in particular the Prime Minister&mdash;it was cabinet practice for a minister to be able to vary a direction to expend money over two years to just three months immediately prior to an election? Is the minister really suggesting to the Senate that we accept that the former minister did this off her own bat without any consultation with or direction from cabinet colleagues? Can the minister indicate whether, if a minister takes that course of action, it is necessary to get the approval of the Department of Finance for the committal of such a sum of money in such a short period?</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no intention to move away from the 20-year phase-in period for moving women to a pensionable age of 65.

The 40- to 50-year age group has shown the most significant increase of women into the work force. Between 1982 and 1993, the participation rates have gone from 47 per cent to 65 per cent for married women aged 45 to 54, and from 60 per cent to 69 per cent for single women in the same age group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not just introduced this change willy-nilly; it has introduced this change because it is very aware of the dramatically increasing labour force participation rate of women and their increasing access to superannuation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last four or five weeks I have had the opportunity to visit and speak to staff of the Customs Service at broad meetings in each of the capital cities of Australia, including Canberra. My staff estimate that I have spoken to and heard comments from around 2,000 Customs staff during those meetings. I have also had meetings for lengthy periods with the PSU delegates in each of the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My office has received more than 50 submissions directly from Customs Service staff. Within the Customs Service more than 400 submissions have been received from either individual members of staff or groups of staff at the workplace commenting about the recommendations. The PSU will make a major submission to the government about the recommendations, and the management will also prepare a report&mdash;as will my own department, DITARD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found the consultation process to be extremely worth while. An overwhelming majority of staff members accept the need for change in various aspects of customs administration. They feel rather aggrieved and believe that some of the criticisms in the report should have been directed more at management than at them as the ordinary staff. Many of them are concerned about the recommendations dealing with redundancies, and the suggestion in the report that there may be 1,000 to 1,400 redundancies. They are responding in detail to that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that a good atmosphere for change is developing amongst Customs Service staff members. They realised that the Midford-Paramount case last year was not a good episode for the Customs Service and that they have to get on with the job of change. I am very encouraged by that. I am very pleased to be able to take part in those discussions. I am told by customs staff that I may be the first minister for customs in its long history to have actually gone through such a process of meeting so many staff members. Overall, I think we have the basis to get a good outcome on the report, because it is leading to the acceptance by customs staff that the reform process has to be driven as much from the bottom up as from the top down.</PARA>

Is this an example of the partnerships for development program working, and is NorTel committing its own funds to expanding R&amp;D in Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1477" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, TECHNOLOGY AND REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are three questions here, and the short answers to all three of them are: yes, yes and yes. In order that justice be done to this important question, I should say that this is a good example of the partnerships for development program working. This is a strategic alliance that is being formed between an international company and a domestic Australian company that enhances the capacity of both&mdash;and particularly enhances the capacity of the domestic Australian company, Exicom, which is by any test a best practice company, a world standard company, a company that Australia should be proud of, but a company that by forming this strategic alliance has increased its reach into the export market, particularly in Asia and the Persian Gulf. This is exactly what this partnership program sets about to do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last week we sat I mentioned that ERG and the  Nokia telecommunications company are doing exactly the same as Exicom and NorTel, and of course NCR, Datacraft and Stallion Technology are other examples of some companies in Australia forming a strategic alliance with an international company, this time in the field of computing. The partnerships program is about expanding Australian-based research and development and manufacturing, it is about boosting information technology in Australia and creating exports in that very important field, and it is about integrating Australian-based information technology into the telecommunications global network.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my answer by giving some fairly salutary figures about what all this means in real dollars for an Australian company, and thus in jobs for Australian workers. In 1992-93 Exicom's turnover and exports grew on the previous year. Turnover grew from $133 million to $156 million while exports increased from $19 million to $26 million. Nearly 70 per cent of Exicom's Villawood exports increase went to Asian markets: China, Pakistan and Taiwan. New markets for Exicom include an order from NorTel for P-phone handsets worth $US30 million in the first year, and they will be distributed in Canada and the United States. It has cracked, from Australia, what is a high technology market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exicom's Villawood plant now employs nearly 650 Australians. During next year 50 new jobs will be created because of this new contract. NorTel has established a significant research and development facility at Wollongong University. By 1997, under this program, NorTel expects to spend $20 million on local research and development for high technology in telecommunications in Australia. Its exports are up as a consequence. It is a good example of a government program working and bringing good quality, high technology jobs to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Faulkner undertook at that time to provide a more detailed response following the gazettal of the areas on 8 March 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Heritage Commission has advised me as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The Draft report of the CALM/AHC regional assessment identified 44 places of significance and 40 rare and endemic plant sites in the Southern Forest region. As a result of the reassessment process since the draft report was released some changes occurred to the number and shape of places. The Final CALM/AHC report has identified 40 places of significance and 35 rare and endemic plant sites in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additions and deletions to areas and subareas was mainly due to a reassessment of the re-examination of landform and soil diversity values and a reassessment of disturbance. Five areas (Darling, Yeticup, Gully, Parryvale, Thornton), two subareas (Barker and Rivett) and large parts of three subareas (Springs, Mitchell and Nordagup) were removed due to the reassessment of the landform and soils diversity criteria. These areas, subareas or parts of subareas were withdrawn from consideration on the basis that the landform and soils diversity methodology was not yet sufficiently well developed to gain clear acceptance by the scientific community; and that the main thrust of the Southern Forest project was the identification of forest values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minor additions and deletions were made to many other areas and subareas as a result of new information on disturbance becoming available. As a result of these changes to areas and subarea some name changes have also occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Almost all values are sensitive to logging operations in some way, and therefore all the interim listed areas are sensitive to logging. The Commission is unable to provide information on which areas are subject to logging operations. This information may be sought from CALM, as CALM is the agency responsible for land management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Approximately 138 000 hectares of the total 527 640 hectares of interim listed places is managed by CALM for purposes that include timber production on a sustained yield basis. This is approximately 25 percent of the area of interim listed places.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been advised that the answer to the honourable Senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I presume that the advertisement to which Senator Calvert refers is contained in the feature article on `Training for a Better Future' in the Hobart Mercury on 20 January 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DAS Staff Development in Tasmania was invited to contribute to this feature as one of the significant public sector training providers in the State. The feature was designed to explain the career paths available to young people, the opportunities available for re-training and the advantages of continuous training programs. It was entirely appropriate for DAS Staff Development to contribute to the feature as public sector career development and training are the rationale for the organisation's existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advertisement was not designed to seek work in the private sector market, nor was it a `new foray' into that market. It served to advertise the availability to the public sector market in Tasmania of courses run by DAS Staff Development, which, as part of DAS Support Services is operating on a market-priced, competitive basis in the public sector marketplace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Tasmania in the financial year to date, three private sector employees have been trained, all as top-up participants in scheduled courses conducted by DAS Staff Development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) DAS Staff Development is in direct competition with private sector providers for work in the public sector Australia wide and indeed, within DAS itself. However, DAS Staff Development is a major user of private sector consultants' services. In the financial year to date, over $650 000 has been expended on consultants' services and by the end of the financial year, this figure will be close to $1m. DAS Staff Development both competes against the private sector providers for work in the public sector and also employs them extensively for assignments which demand skills and expertise which are not present in the organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is not DAS Staff Development's intention to sell services to the private sector, it is necessary in a competitive market-place to advertise in a modest way to attract a larger share of the public sector market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I have not received any complaints about this issue although I am aware that one of my colleagues has dealt with one complaint about the matter in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have stated above, DAS Staff Development does operate in a competitive environment where private sector trainers seek and obtain large amounts of work in the public sector domain. This Government recognises that such competition is healthy for both the public sector providers and recipients of these services. However, it means that public sector providers such as DAS Staff Development have to operate in a competitive way to maintain their market share and this will continue to be the case in the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) I do not accept that the current marketing practices of DAS Staff Development will adversely affect private sector training providers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I stated in my preliminary comments on this matter, the principle which applies for all DAS businesses in competing with private sector providers for private sector work is the principle of competitive neutrality. This entails the application of all statutory charges, and equivalent taxes to DAS businesses in order to put them on an even footing with their private sector competitors and it is a principle endorsed in the Hilmer Report. The commercialisation of DAS has given the private sector access to potential income in excess of $800m annually, which was not available before commercialisation and for which DAS businesses now compete in open competition.</PARA>

Senator Robert Ray asked that I look at questions which referred to individuals in pejorative terms, such as `discredited', `notorious' and so forth. Such terms in referring to members of this parliament or those of a state or territory parliament or to other protected office holders may be out of order under standing order 193 and the chair may rule accordingly. That standing order, however, does not protect persons other than the office holders listed in the standing order. The question which gave rise to Senator Ray's intervention referred to a person not protected by the standing order. I again refer honourable senators, as I did on 10 February 1994, to the Senate's privilege resolution No. 9, which enjoins honourable senators to exercise their privilege of freedom of speech responsibly and with regard to the rights of others.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator McKiernan's remarks were not out of order as he did not threaten to do anything other than exercise his right of speech in a certain way. Senators Panizza and McKiernan and all senators would do well, however, to have regard to the Senate's privilege resolution No. 9, to which I have previously referred.</PARA>

Accordingly, a motion to take note of an answer is a debate that does take place as part of the 30 minutes allocated each day for debates of this kind. In that sense, Senator Baume is right in concluding, as he did, that this is cutting into that time. I suggest for that reason it is in everybody's interest that debate on this matter be attenuated if people do want to spend time on ministers' answers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tambling this day, relating to informal voting in an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission election.</PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps I should indicate that it was a non-answer, as the minister has had to take the question on notice and seek the information that is required. I remind the Senate and Senator Collins that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission elections were held on Saturday, 4 December 1993. We are now addressing this issue some 3 1/2 months later. The election to which I referred, the ward of Nhulunbuy South, was declared on 14 January 1994. I would have anticipated that ATSIC would have precipitated some action in this regard. This issue was raised with me at Nhulunbuy on 25 January this year. I discussed it with officers of ATSIC at Nhulunbuy and was informed at that time that it was likely that a new election would be called. Therefore, I was appalled today when Senator Collins was not able to acknowledge any information on this issue. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question I put to Senator Collins today was very much his portfolio. It related to what ATSIC initiatives were now being taken on this issue. Last week the Australian Electoral Commission issued an electoral news file, No. 39, dated February 1994. That news file summarised the various ATSIC elections all around Australia. In it were the Northern Territory results, which included the three wards of Nhulunbuy&mdash;Nhulunbuy East, Nhulunbuy South and Nhulunbuy West.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the ward that I raised during question time today&mdash;Nhulunbuy South&mdash;four people were named as the successful candidates: Timothy Lalara, Nancy (Burgoyne) Lalara, Samuel Numamurdirdi and Lindsay Joshua. Let me indicate that I take no particular offence at any of those people being named. But what I do take offence at is the way in which this matter has been allowed to drag on, given that it was well known to the Electoral Commission and ATSIC well before the declaration of the poll. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been able to ascertain that the problems arose because the ballot papers were not put in the required declaration envelopes but inserted straight into the ballot box. Despite the fact that the Electoral Commission team that visited Nhulunbuy had been trained, for some time it chose not to carry out this important procedure. At some date before 14 January it was known to the Electoral Commission that this procedure was to be adopted. In fact, it was incorrectly not adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that at the end of the day the successful candidates were determined by pulling names out of a hat&mdash;and that is not alluded to in any way in the AEC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Electoral </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newsfile</EMPHASIS>&mdash;is a very important omission of an important fundamental electoral principle. It is staggering that this matter has been allowed to drag on. As I said earlier, this matter was known to ATSIC. It was certainly conveyed to me on 25 January by staff at Nhulunbuy. I am, therefore, alarmed that the minister was not able to react today during question time. I would have thought Mr Tickner would have provided Senator Collins with an appropriate brief and response on this issue. It is not good enough for the government to now camouflage very important points of principle with regard to an election&mdash;the fact that there are over 800 people eligible to vote in this particular ward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the detailed news file that the turnout in that electorate was 57.87 per cent and that the actual number of voters was 489. However, 477 votes were rejected. That meant that 10 formal votes and two informal votes were recorded. There was, therefore, a quota of three for the election. But, of course, the quota was not used&mdash;the names were picked out of a hat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the form shows that, whilst there were four vacancies in this ward, there were 10 nominations. This makes a mockery of Australia's election procedures. I would have thought a Labor government, with its high principles in this area, would have determined this matter well in advance of this time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No-one is trying to camouflage anything. I suspect that the question should have been directed to Senator McMullan, the minister who is responsible for the Australian Electoral Commission&mdash;the body which conducted and was responsible for the conduct of the elections. The Electoral Commission conducts elections on behalf of a number of organisations. While listening to Senator Tambling's question, I recalled, if my memory is correct, that it had actually conducted the election on behalf of ATSIC. I sought information and discovered that that is the case, and that the electoral difficulties that did occur at Nhulunbuy, which are acknowledged, were officially the responsibility of the AEC. The AEC is answerable to this chamber through Senator McMullan, not me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I sought this advice. I have been advised that the Australian Electoral Commission has acknowledged that there were serious difficulties with the ATSIC elections at Nhulunbuy. The AEC has reported to ATSIC that its staff at the polling stations&mdash;mainly locally engaged people&mdash;had misunderstood the voting procedures and had, on the face of it, consequently misdirected voters, leading to a large number of informal votes. I am also advised that the 97 per cent informal vote figure has not yet been confirmed by the AEC, although the informal vote is known to be very high. </PARA>

For instance, the board may decide whether a particular salary level is inequitable, determine arrangements for the proportions of premiums to be paid by the member and the employer, and defer decisions on invalidity retirement until the board deems it appropriate to refer the matter back to a panel. The committee is concerned about whether there is independent review of these discretions, the exercise of which could have important effects upon individuals.</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, to increase the Medicare levy, thereby breaking yet another of the Government's election promises, and causing even greater damage to private health insurance and the health care of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Deputy President, all honourable senators have to remember that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, owes his leadership to a commitment to the ALP Left and to some members of the Centre Left not to increase the health tax take for Australians in the form of a co-payment. I am interested to see that the minister in the chamber, who is presumably going to defend the real health minister, is Senator Crowley. She would be proud, I think, to take credit for having swung the numbers behind the Prime Minister in delivering the Prime Ministership to him. The numbers apparently seem to depend upon the co-payment which has been introduced being overturned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable senators to a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Telegraph</EMPHASIS> of 15 December 1991 in which Senator Crowley is reported as saying that she had contacted Mr Keating and asked whether this meant that, if in the future he became leader of the party, the decision would be reversed. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Mr Keating confirmed that this would be the case, that a Government led by him would reverse the decision as a matter of priority."</PARA>
<PARA>The article quotes Senator Crowley as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I want it changed as soon as possible and Mr Keating has said he will do it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although sources close to Mr Keating confirmed he made the pledge to abolish the co-payment "from Day One" the former treasurer is maintaining his tactic of public silence and refused to comment.</PARA>
<PARA>We all know that the facts of that statement were borne out because as soon as Mr Keating became Prime Minister, he abolished the co-payments. So it is true to say that the price of the leadership, getting the votes to overturn Bob Hawke, was that the co-payment decision be overturned. Now Mr Keating is refusing to rule out an increase in the health tax through the Medicare levy. They are all taxes by one name or the other. Yet on 13 January 1992, in an article quoting the former health minister, Mr Howe, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> reported:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe said the Government did not "really need to contemplate another rise" in the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"What the Commonwealth is doing is saying for the next five years we will guarantee a significant increase in terms of funding . . . so I think that means there probably wouldn't be a need for a rise in the Medicare levy because effectively we would have covered the major area.</PARA>
<PARA>It was clearly spelt out prior to the election that Medicare is working. On 5 March, the Prime of Australia Mr Keating, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The funding in Medicare is working.</PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could be clearer than that. There was no suggestion then that Medicare was not working, so they needed more money to honour the promises of the new health minister and the need, which was already self-evident at the time of the election, to deal with Medicare and improve it. No, at that time it was concealed from the voters, just as it has been concealed from those who will vote in by-elections in the weeks ahead and those who voted in a by-election last Saturday. They were not told that there was going to be an increase in the Medicare levy. Once again, this Prime Minister was dancing around like a cat on a hot tin roof concealing the truth from the people who would pass judgement on him. I remind the Senate that Mr Hawke, when asked questions about increasing the Medicare levy in August 1991, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would hit the low-income people more than would our (co-payments) arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the mob that got rid of the co-payments arrangements as part of the price for giving the Prime Minister the Prime Ministership. What are they going to do now? They are going to hit the low income people even more than they would have been hit with the previous arrangement for co-payments. That was confirmed by the previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposed reforms will increase the cost of private health insurance premiums by increasing the costs both to the funds and the hospitals. By that I am talking about the proposals that Senator Richardson put on the table a couple of months ago. He said that the changes will improve our health system by helping private health insurance. But they will not. They will simply add to the exodus from private health insurance. Last year 300,000 people got out of private health insurance, 80,000 in the last three months of the year. The proposals that Senator Richardson has put up will make that exodus a rush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only today a man rang my office and told me that he lives in Baulkham Hills, has three children and is just a battler. He has been onto the Prime Minister's office and he has been onto Senator Richardson's office, telling them that if this increase in the Medicare levy goes ahead he will be forced, despite his wishes, to get out of private health insurance because it will be the last straw that breaks the camel's back&mdash;he will have to rely totally on the public health system. It is essentially simply another tax. People like the battler from Baulkham Hills, the elderly, the self-funded retirees who are in such desperate difficulty at present as a result of this government's policies, against their wishes, will end up finding that they cannot afford to pay any kind of an increased levy and private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy is symptomatic of the government's cowardice and total failure to realistically attack the problems of private health insurance and that is because it has no other solutions. The logical step would be to boost the numbers going into private health insurance by using financial support measures, but the opposition within the ALP to making private health insurance more attractive will not allow Senator Richardson to even consider such an option. The Medicare levy hike is even more desperate. Those who are hanging onto private insurance will decide that they can no longer afford insurance, a higher Medicare levy, their contribution through their general taxes and the gap payments. They will have to say enough is enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the Prime Minister and Senator Richardson going around the country last week spouting contradictory messages about this possible increase. It is certain, as day follows night, that it will be increased in the May budget in some form or other. The last time Senator Richardson increased the levy, which was only July last year&mdash;he increased it to 1.4 per cent&mdash;he said that it would reduce waiting times at hospitals. That has not happened. There are now about 112,000 people waiting for elective surgery, with more than 30 per cent of these people waiting on those lists for six months. Yet over and over again we have heard the minister dismiss these people waiting in pain as being `only three per cent'. Let me tell the government this: three per cent in pain is three per cent too many. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy rose from one per cent in February 1984 to 1.2 per cent in December 1986 to 1.4 per cent in July last year. The last time the minister said that he had no plans to increase the levy. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program in May last year he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's fairly high. People are paying 1.4 per cent of their income and that's a pretty hefty slug. I think there are other ways to contain the costs and pay for them than simply jacking up the levy.</PARA>
<PARA>Why has he changed his tune? It is because he cannot get the support from the Prime Minister for the measures that need taking, that we all understand need taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister to me is very much like a rat in a trap&mdash;he is going round and round trying to find solutions to the insoluble. His government will not wear a co-payment. He has been increasingly rationing health care. We have had the queues, I have mentioned, for so-called elective surgery. We have had delays in getting MRI scans; delays in getting the reports on the MRIs; delays in X-rays; delays in CAT scans; and refusal to allow certain important drugs onto the pharmaceutical benefits scheme in an attempt to contain costs. We have seen the attempt to cut out the opticians' tests and the refusal to allow the testing for osteoporosis for women as a diagnostic tool. These are all rationing measures, although the government will not admit them as such. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the only other way for this rat in the trap is to break the election promises, do a U-turn on his own May 1993 statement and jack up the Medicare tax. He has spent his year promising more money for Aboriginal health, medical research, mental health and breast cancer&mdash;all extremely important issues&mdash;but now his day of reckoning is upon him. Where is the money coming from? There is no other solution to get more money into Australia's health system than to take some of the burden off the public sector. By giving financial support to low to middle income earners, only then can these queues be reduced, the rationing of services be reduced and some of the minister's promises at least be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is to be pitied, although I guess he would reject the pity. He reminds me of a rat in a trap. He has had to admit that he has lost the support of his Prime Minister. He has been rejected by the Prime Minister publicly on two occasions in recent months for his so-called reform. The so-called power broker of the Labor Party is moving aside for a new entrant to his portfolio. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Certainly, after 10 years, I am not saying that everything is perfect. If there are something like 30,000 Australians waiting for longer than six months, I think that is inappropriate and it is something that we should work on. It is worth acknowledging that that is something the whole of government in Australia&mdash;the federal government, the state governments, which run the hospitals, and the Commonwealth government&mdash;should address.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Basically, this motion deals with an issue that is not terribly popular&mdash;that is, to have a good health care system, we have to spend money. We have to acknowledge that there will be a greater demand from the public for us to meet community needs&mdash;particularly needs that are forever expanding in the health area as more technology and more diagnostic methods and tests become available&mdash;and we have to meet a lot of that demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is basically arguing that the private health system is the way to go. The Australian Democrats argue, `Yes, we have a private system and it has a place'. Many of the needs that have now been identified will not be met by private health insurance, but some of them need the cooperation of the private health insurance industry. In particular, some of the recommendations in the Burdekin report see a role for both the private and the public system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote some of the recommendations of the Burdekin report and ask Senator Newman where the money will come from for many of them. One of the recommendations in chapter 5 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal, State and Territory governments should provide increased funding and resources to integrate mental health services as a matter of urgency. In the first instance Governments must give priority to redirecting funding from high cost institutions to such services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments should accord a high priority to improving inter-agency and inter-sectoral co-operation and coordination.</PARA>
<PARA>All of that will cost money. One of the recommendations in chapter six states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government, in consultation with State and Territory Governments, service providers, mental health professionals and allied staff, and people with mental awareness should develop and implement national standards concerning the regulation and maintenance of psychiatric care and treatment.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government, in consultation with State and Territory Governments and service providers should examine and clarify the treatment roles of mental health professionals and allied staff working both in institutions and in the community. In particular, the roles of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists should be carefully assessed to ensure the most effective utilisation of professional services.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of mental health professionals and allied staff in the delivery of community-based services must be adequately recognised by the Federal government in Medicare funding.</PARA>
<PARA>I turn from the many recommendations in the Burdekin report to look at Aboriginal health, which the AMA, the minister, and the opposition, along with the Democrats, have all acknowledged to be an area of high priority&mdash;an area that has to be addressed in this year's budget. In the most recent copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Medicine</EMPHASIS>, 21 February 1994, the President of the AMA said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The unmet need for health care in Aboriginal Australia is staggering. Everywhere I looked I found services desperately under-resourced in both a human and financial way. The low morale of many Aboriginal health workers was disturbing.</PARA>
<PARA>Page 186 of the most recent <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991, at the First National Rural Health Conference in Toowoomba, convened by the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, a workshop on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health called for attention to education and training for Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal professionals and the full implementation of the recommendations of the National Aboriginal Health Strategy Working Party Report.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Newman again: where will this money come from? Perhaps the opposition may say, `Cut something; redirect money from somewhere else within the health budget'. If it is going to say that, let it identify where we can make savings. What areas are we supposed to be cutting to provide the money that is needed in these two areas alone?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving on, we can see the needs, which have already been talked about today by the two previous speakers, of the public hospital system. Increasing some coverage by the private health insurance industry&mdash;and even the minister's own package&mdash;will do little but put a floor under the number of people leaving private health insurance. It will do nothing for the unmet needs that already exist, particularly in the areas of infrastructure spending, the provision of new pieces of equipment, the upgrading of existing hospitals and the provision of hospital beds to the outlying suburbs in our larger cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back again to some of Senator Newman's earlier arguments that somehow by supporting the private health insurance industry everything will be fixed. I suggest to Senator Newman that what we really should be fixing is the private health insurance industry itself. We have just had a period in this country where industry after industry has been encouraged to modernise and to reform. Micro-economic reform was one of catchcries and one of the common terms we heard. The private health insurance industry somehow seems to have missed out. If we look at its profit performance we see a steadily increasing level of profit and virtually no effort whatsoever at more efficient, effective practices; no effort to be more accountable; and, if we listen to some of the private hospitals, no real effort to meet their changing needs to ensure different procedures are carried out in different ways to ensure shorter periods of stay in hospital. This applies right across the board in a variety of private hospitals. I refer particularly to the need to change insurance practices for mental health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman's urgency motion today referred to `causing even greater damage to private health insurance'. I want to stress that I believe it is the private health insurance industry itself that is damaging private health insurance. People and families are actually voting with their feet now. They have done their sums. They see that if they put that money in the bank then they have a chance each year to afford quite a number of days in a private hospital&mdash;and indeed if their condition were any more serious they would end up in a public hospital anyway. So they are actually making a quite rational decision to leave private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that the private health insurance industry, instead of sitting around and believing in the cargo cult that somehow the government is going to come to its rescue and maybe give tax deductibility, which would ensure its profits for several years before people started complaining again about increased premiums, should be looking at getting its own house in order. It should become more competitive. It should be offering a far wider variety of insurance options. It should be listening not just to members of the public who are voting with their feet but to doctors and particularly the private hospitals which are asking for different types of cover and different types of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to get back to the basic question of where the money is coming from. As I said when I began, talking about an increase in taxation is not terribly popular. But we have to acknowledge that this Medicare levy is already far short of the mark. It does not cover anything like the full amount drawn out of the tax purse to fund Medicare. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps as we look at the small percentage&mdash;only 17 per cent, thank you, Senator Herron&mdash;we should be asking government to be more open and a little more honest. Perhaps we should transfer from that general tax paid column of our income tax return the full and correct amount to the Medicare column. Perhaps in that way pressure would come from members of the public for the government to be a little more accountable in terms of where their money is going. I think, if the community realised how much it is already paying for Medicare through the tax system, we would have a number of areas that the government would need to check again, to be a little more open and a little more public about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot finish today in the two minutes I have remaining without asking the minister how he thinks his package of reforms is going to do anything whatsoever to help the public system. I note the minister today claimed that he does have Labor Party support, perhaps that suggests that the committee which is just about to report, I understand, is wasting its time. Perhaps all those people who sent submissions and took a lot of time and effort to make comments on his package have indeed wasted their time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the minister was still with us, I would ask him to explain where the government's priorities are. He seems to have made a 180-degree shift to start calling for an increase in the Medicare levy while on the one hand having this package very much alive, with some $9 1/2 million already spent on it. What exactly is the minister doing? Is he preparing the way for somebody else to take over the portfolio? If he is, we may be beginning all over again with a totally new package, perhaps with no increase in the Medicare levy and perhaps with something that we have absolutely no notion of as we debate this today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in conclusion I would just like to ask again: is this motion today referring to all Australians when it refers to `causing even greater damage to the health care of all Australians'? If we mean all Australians, surely we include those with mental illness and Aboriginal Australians. We really do need to look quite honestly and openly at where the money is coming from if it is not going to come out of the Medicare levy. </PARA>

No more money as a percentage of gross domestic product has been spent on health care in the last 13 years&mdash;no more at all. We have rationing in the community, and he talks about the small percentage on waiting lists.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I left work in a public hospital in Queensland three years ago.

He got his  photograph on the front page of the paper. I saw him on a major program talking about how he was going to cure the Aboriginal health problem. The life expectancy of Aboriginal females is 15 years less than the non-Aboriginal average. The life expectancy of Aboriginal males is 22 years less than the non-Aboriginal average. What is Senator Richardson going to do about it? I will call him to account each year I am here and ask him what he has done. He is grandstanding; he is always grandstanding. He takes whatever photo opportunity he can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was going to do a lot about breast cancer. Honourable senators will remember that breast cancer was the big thing on his agenda. What has he done in the past 12 months? He has put out press releases. That is just marvellous. Now he has taken up the issue of Aboriginal health. What is he going to do about the life expectancy of Aboriginals in his time? The infant mortality rate of Aboriginals is two and a half to three and a half times that of non-Aboriginals. Let him talk about how he has improved that situation in 12 months time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as I mentioned in the summary before, he is going to get an agreement to increase the number of surgeons&mdash;something along those lines. It takes 15 years to train a surgeon, taking into account the undergraduate period of time, the hospital standing and nine years of post-hospital employment. So a great thing that will be. There is already an oversupply of general surgeons in the community and there is an oversupply of general practitioners. Maldistribution is the problem, as honourable senators know. Here Senator Richardson goes again&mdash;off around the world. He did not answer a question. He did not answer the substantive argument; he did not even try to because it is indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's answer is more tax. Senator Richardson calls it a levy. It is a tax by any other name. The jobs levy and the Medicare levy are just taxes. The Labor Party's answer is to increase tax and throw more money at the problem. Look at what has happened in relation to the Aboriginal community in that regard: 257,000 people in the country have gone backwards because more money has been thrown at them&mdash;over $1,000 million a year. There needs to be fundamental reform, which is our policy. Senator Richardson said that we do not have a policy. Our policy has gone through the shadow ministry and the Policy Review Committee, and it is supported. It is fairly straightforward. We have done away with some aspects, but our policy stands. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will argue that at another stage; I do not want to waste time doing so now. This motion refers to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention of the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, to increase the Medicare levy, thereby breaking yet another of the Government's election promises, and causing even greater damage to private health insurance and the health care of all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>The motion immediately triggers the question: is it the intention of the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) to raise the levy? I think the wording of the motion betrays the lack of knowledge of the opposition&mdash;possibly including Senator Newman&mdash;about how decisions are made in the government. This decision would be part of the budget, so it must be a part of a cabinet decision&mdash;as all decisions are&mdash;based on discussion with cabinet subcommittees and with caucus, and informed by discussions and consultations with and feedback from the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The feedback that I am getting in my office and as I travel around Victoria, which I am passing on, is that most people have no argument with raising the levy, as long as it is applied progressively to income; in other words, it is not necessarily hitting the poor, as Senator Herron and others have suggested it would. Such a rise, indeed, might lessen the need for private health insurance. But would that necessarily be a negative? People do not have to have private insurance. I, like many Australians, choose not to have private health cover, although I do have cover for services not covered by Medicare, such as dental care. I would hope that some of the health services which are at present outside Medicare might be able to be included if funding were increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was accepted by a review of Medicare benefits undertaken in the mid-1980s that services covered should be expanded if the funding were available. I will mention one such service&mdash;and Senator Lees has already referred to it&mdash;and that is clinical psychology. As a counselling psychologist before I entered parliament, I often unwillingly had to refer patients for psychiatric treatment when their needs would have been better met by a clinical psychologist&mdash;but then they would have had to pay the full charge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want to cut hospital waiting lists and improve service provision, particularly in states like Victoria, where the present state government is cutting services, there is a need to give greater support to service provision for all Australians, not just those who can afford to take out private insurance. So I am much more concerned about possible damage to the health care of Australians than I am about possible damage to private health insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of our government is to improve the health care of all Australians. In my view, this is more likely to be enhanced by the maintenance of the services available to all Australians, whether or not they can afford it and/or whether or not they choose to have private health cover. If that maintenance necessitates an increase in the Medicare levy, that is surely preferable to the alternative which seems to be implied in this motion; that is, that people should pay for private insurance rather than pay more for Medicare. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that private funds do not charge according to income, as the Medicare levy does, and they do not scale their contributions according to a member's ability to pay. I personally would have no problems with an increased levy on higher income earners, such as all of us in this chamber, should a decision be made to raise the income ceiling so that the percentage of income going to the levy becomes more equitable by increasing it as income increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is precisely because we are keeping our election promises that there may be a need for some increase in the levy for some of us. Some of those promises now being implemented are the inclusion in Medicare of bone densitometry for people at risk of osteoporosis, a dental program for health card holders and an additional $57.7 million over the next four years for palliative care, to cite just a few examples. This is in stark contrast to opposition policies at the time of the election, exactly one year ago, as Senator Richardson has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was my experience during that campaign, particularly in opposition held country electorates, that it was the opposition health policies, including its Medicare policies, which together with the GST were turning voters away from it in droves. These were often voters from its own traditional base. I speak of country Victoria. This was particularly so in relatively isolated rural areas without access to community health centres, an initiative of a previous Labor government in the 1970s, or public hospital facilities. These facilities, of course, are shrinking rapidly in Victoria under the Kennett government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From talking to people when I have been overseas, to overseas visitors in this country and particularly to migrants coming from overseas, it is continually emphasised to me that we are the envy of most other countries for the security of health cover available to us through Medicare. The standards of health care provision are also impressive, particularly in the public hospital system, but the big difference between the Australian system and the systems in most other countries is that it is available universally and available on the basis of need. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues Senator Newman and Senator Herron in this urgency motion. I would have thought the Minister for Health, Senator Richardson, besides needing to be in the chamber for this important debate, would have been far more measured in his boast at question time that we have the best health system going, considering his most public embarrassment about and condemnation of the health system with regard to Aboriginal health. His parading on the national media hardly led the public of Australia to believe that the minister at least thought we have the best health system. Clearly, the minister was trying to get the message across that we do not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a nation we may be able to do better, but it is startling to say the least that this government has just woken up to the fact that we have a problem with Aboriginal health services. Senator Richardson is trying to tell us that, after 11 years with the portfolio, the government has just woken up to this problem, as properly outlined by Senator Herron. Amongst Aborigines, infant mortality is 3 1/2 times higher than the average, female life expectancy is some 15 years fewer than the average, there are problems with sanitary living conditions and with the personnel needed to support this particular community. Moreover, there is concern about maladministration and about the resources being directed to and arriving for Aboriginal people's needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it would have been far more helpful, if not worthy, for the minister to address this urgency motion directly during his contribution instead of, as Senator Herron properly outlined, merely delving into political irrelevancies, mentioning the Fremantle by-election and Mrs Bishop and attacking Senator Newman and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters are political irrelevancies. It was very easy for Senator Richardson to do that, but he failed to address in his responsible position one of the most basic and serious needs of Australian families. To that end, Australian families have every reason to be concerned about the upcoming May budget and what tax increases lie ahead for them, considering it has only been some nine months since the last budget was brought down with its new array of taxes visited upon Australian households. Not content with those tax increases which directly influence those households, the minister is now suggesting that in the May budget the Medicare levy should be increased from 1.4 per cent to two per cent&mdash;a 40 per cent increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson has set this issue running. If it were not for the string of by-elections we are now facing, it would be all but policy in the May budget. However, with the array of by-elections before us, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has felt somewhat obliged to deny such an increase. As unconvincing as it is, it has set the stage for an increase in the Medicare levy. That is nothing short of another slug for the Australian people. It is a regressive tax upon the lower and middle income families of Australia. Simply notching up the Medicare levy to meet the country's health crisis is no solution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with a true sense of pride and honour that I rise this afternoon to deliver my first speech. I say pride and honour because to be chosen by one's state and party to serve in this chamber is truly an honour. It is especially so when one has been chosen to represent the best and most beautiful of the states by the most dynamic political party this country has produced in the most important house of this parliament. It is a bit like winning the trifecta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My presence here today was activated by the decision of Senator Brian Archer to retire. On behalf of the people of Tasmania, I pay tribute to him for his work, and I wish him and his wife Dorothy well in retirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also take this opportunity to thank the Clerk of the Senate and his staff, and senators of all persuasions, for their kind assistance and guidance in acquainting me with this house, its procedures and, above all, its maze of corridors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to pay special tribute to my partner, friend and wife, Michelle, who has been so supportive. In doing so, I acknowledge her presence in the gallery today, and also her birthday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have referred to the winning trio of Tasmania, the Liberal Party and the Senate, and I seek briefly to deal with each before moving on to some personal and philosophical matters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To represent Tasmania, Australia's island state, is a pleasure. The only disadvantage is having to spend so much time out of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania's natural beauty, its non-polluting power generation, its decentralised nature, its industries, its lifestyle and its friendly people make it truly unique. Its still relatively unpolluted condition needs to be maintained and improved upon to fully exploit our very real and burgeoning agrifood export and tourism potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our export trade is relatively modest in total figures, but on a per head of population basis we hold our heads very high with a total export trade of $1.5 billion in 1992-93. That was a six per cent increase over the previous year. That was despite the depressed commodity prices in the areas of zinc, wool and copper and the so-called Keating engineered depression that `we had to have'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our exports to the Association of South East Asian Nations we have seen rapid growth in the last 12 months. Indeed, 65 per cent of our trade went to Asia compared with the national average, which is below 60 per cent. Good relations with Asia are vitally important to the future economic wellbeing of my state and, I venture to add, our country as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen strong growth in the agrifood sectors of meat, dairy, seafood, wine and fresh vegetables. Our economic focus needs to adjust to include and fully utilise these new opportunities. I am sure that under the sound guidance of the state Liberal government our position will continue to improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania has a proud record, yet successive Labor governments have cut Commonwealth funding to Tasmania on a per capita basis by over 30 per cent in the past decade compared with the Australian average of a 16.4 per cent reduction. That slashing of funds is unfair, inappropriate and has caused great budgetary difficulties to successive Tasmanian governments. The honourable member for Blaxland, the now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), said in his maiden speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the standard of living that people enjoy varies in accordance with what government services are available to them.</PARA>
<PARA>His government's record in slashing funds to Tasmania has led to a decreased standard of living for my fellow Tasmanians, who have the lowest income per head of population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding to Tasmania ought to be on the basis that Tasmania is entitled to all the rights and entitlements of a fully-fledged state. Funding simply on a per head basis denies us, as a state, from enjoying all the infrastructure requirements we need to effectively run our state in such areas as policing, health and education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have just referred to is often passed over as dull economics, and I agree to a certain extent that it is. Whilst the figures are important for the welfare of our state and our nation, we as parliamentarians need to focus beyond the figures. We need to focus on the impact of changing trends. My state's zinc workers have declined in number. Woolgrowers have been devastated. And within each of these industries there are families, mothers, fathers and children with hopes and aspirations of their own that are thwarted, if not completely shattered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, with our growth industries each opportunity should be seen not only in export dollars and balance of payment terms, which are of course vital, but also as lifting each individual's self-esteem, allowing people to make a positive, useful and fulfilling contribution to the state and their fellow Tasmanians and letting them realise their own dreams&mdash;be it a new car, a house, an engagement or wedding ring or the opportunity of starting a family. A truly great Tasmanian, Dame Enid Lyons, said in her maiden speech:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the problems of government are not the problems of statistics but the problems of human values, human hearts and human feelings.</PARA>
<PARA>In all these economic matters, the impact of decisions on individual family units, with their own dreams and aspirations, should never be forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Liberal, I can confidently say that the Liberal Party is clearly the party of success and reform in Australian history. Of late, federally, we have not performed so well, but that does not deny us as Liberals, on this side of the house, the right to proclaim in our 50th year that all amendments to our great constitution have been ones that we have supported and initiated, that the vast majority of social reforms have been introduced by us, that the golden era of Australia's history was under the guidance of the Liberal Party and that we hold state and territory government in all but two places&mdash;Queensland and the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ours is a history of success and reform. Ours is a philosophy of dealing with individuals and assisting them to develop their personal skills for the nation's good, as opposed to the dogma that all individuals need to conform, be brought to the lowest common denominator and succumb to the requirements of what the powerbrokers perceive to be the national good. Ours is a philosophy of standing positively for the free person, their initiative, individuality and acceptance of responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike some who bleat `social justice' and point the finger at everyone other than themselves I, like so many other Liberals, have made a real and personal contribution in this area. The reason for that is a belief in personal responsibility. My involvement with the Jireh House Women's Shelter, Youth Accommodation Services of Tasmania and a host of other community welfare organisations is, I believe, a prouder and more sincere record than that of those who simply utter the words `social justice' and then ask government to somehow magically fix it. Personal, individual action speaks so much louder than words. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a senator, I am proud to be a member of this most important house of our parliament. This house is the brake on excesses of government and bureaucracy and a protection for the states. Our Senate was given special powers by our founding fathers and we should never seek to diminish those powers, as was recently mooted. The attempts by our Prime Minister to denigrate our chamber with his trademark characteristic is of great concern. I found in the front of Odgers' <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Senate Practice</EMPHASIS> the following quote about the Senate from the Rt Hon. Sir Edmund Barton, our first Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We cannot fail to remember that the Constitution designed the Senate to be a House of greater power than any ordinary second chamber. Not only by its expressed powers, but by the equality of its representation of the States, the Senate was intended to be able to protect the States from aggression.</PARA>
<PARA>I also found in Odgers this quote from Senator the Rt Hon. Sir George Pearce, who has the distinction of being the longest serving member ever of this chamber:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate was constituted as it is, after long fighting, prolonged discussions, many compromises, and many concessions on the part of the various shades of political thought throughout the Commonwealth, and it stands there in the Constitution in a position that has no equal in any Legislature throughout the world.</PARA>
<PARA>That position ought to be protected and employed for our masters&mdash;the people of our various states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each one of us in this chamber is unique. We have been moulded and fashioned by a variety of factors. I, of course, am no exception. As the youngest of six children of an immigrant family that came to Australia in 1961 on an assisted passage, I say on behalf of my whole family a wholehearted thank-you for that assisted passage and the wonderful opportunities provided in this great country. The fact that the then state Labor government arranged the migration also makes it responsible, to a certain extent, for my presence here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My parents sought to instil in me a value system of service above self and dedication to tasks at hand and provided me with a stable, loving, nurturing family home and a deep Christian faith. It is that faith that makes me confident that my parents are watching today's proceedings from a gallery a lot loftier than this place, in all its splendour, could ever provide. Whilst not from a background of financial privilege, I am from the most privileged of backgrounds, wealthy in values and wealthy in family nurture and love. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Educated in the state school system and the University of Tasmania, I decided very early that the philosophy of the Liberal Party was the one for me. Within days of starting at university, I received my bill for compulsory student union membership. Inquiries told me that failure to pay would lead to the withholding of results. What a blot on the life of our academic institutions. The vice-chancellors and the university administrations stand condemned. The very institutions that allegedly foster individual thought force all students, like sheep, into compulsory student union membership under the threat of being denied the fruit of their labours. I found that abhorrent. I still find it abhorrent. I take this opportunity to congratulate the Court government in Western Australia for its initiative and trust that other states will soon follow by abolishing compulsory student unionism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Liberal Students Federation championed the cause of voluntary student unionism and I joined the Liberal Party at university. I am proud of the fact that I am a life member and a former president of that organisation, which has produced so many of today's leaders. The experiences gained, the lessons learned and the friends made will last a lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My first taste of representative democracy was with my fellow students of the University of Tasmania, who so kindly supported me, allowing me to top the polls on many occasions. During my university years I was able to supplement the then tertiary education assistance scheme with taxi driving, farm labouring and a brief stint as a research officer to a truly fantastic former senator, Shirley Walters. She has been a great inspiration to me and I am thankful that I can place that on record today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After university, I was employed as an apprentice and then as a lawyer for some five years. For the past eight years I have been practising in partnership as a barrister and solicitor. Through my legal practice I was fortunate to make contacts with all walks of life. That has been an enriching experience and I am thankful for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that brief thumbnail sketch, I seek in the remaining moments to discuss my personal philosophy and views on some of the controversial issues of the day. I, with Woodrow Wilson, believe that liberty has never come from the government. The history of liberty is the history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is largely a Christian nation. Eighty per cent of our population acknowledges the Christian faith. I hope and pray for Australia's sake that it clings to its Christian heritage and values. I believe in, and will defend, the fundamentals of our constitutional structures, which have served Australia so well for nearly a century. Like all documents, the constitution needs to be refined from time to time. I acknowledge that it may require attention, but not the intrusive surgery as suggested by some. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support our federalist system of government and the rights of the citizens of each state to largely determine their own social and local policies. I am concerned at the trend to internationalism in our domestic law making. Sure, let us learn from our fellow world citizens; let us discuss and debate their ideas, but we should never forgo our national sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The family unit is the fundamental and essential unit of our society. Strong families build strong nations. Strong families provide shelter and nurture for all their members from the rigours of day-to-day life. The family is a haven in which to seek solace. In this, the International Year of the Family I cannot help but feel that the celebrations are being hijacked. If we let down our families, we let down our nation. I join with King George V, who was quoted by Dame Enid Lyons as having said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The foundation of a nation's greatness is in the homes of its people.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, the rate of marriage failures, youth suicides and delinquency and a lot of other social ills can be traced back to the very real pressures being placed on the family unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To succeed, we all need dreams, goals, aspirations&mdash;a vision for the future. At the last election I believe my party lost its focus from the dream and concentrated on the detail. Our dream was real and it remains with me, as I am sure it remains with all my colleagues. To use an analogy: we tried to sell a house to our fellow Australians, a house that would have gone a long way to fulfilling their aspirations, but we got bogged down in telling the people why our mortar was stronger and better than Labor's. We were no longer selling the house, but the individual components that go to make up the house and, accordingly, the people lost sight of our dream. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs a dream, a vision and goals to work towards. But they will not be achieved unless we&mdash;Australians all&mdash;are prepared to make personal sacrifices to achieve those goals. Government, of itself, cannot deliver our dreams. At best, it can only facilitate and encourage. My ideal Australia is one where social justice and fairness are paramount&mdash;measured not by dollars spent on welfare but by support for those in real need and reward for those who work hard. As Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr put it, `I have no respect for the passion of equality which seems to me to be merely idealising envy'. I believe in equality of opportunity, not in equality of outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My ideal Australia is one where every Australian has the opportunity for employment; where family life flourishes, nurturing and supporting all; where our industries&mdash;primary, secondary and tertiary&mdash;are buoyant; and where our flag and national symbols are honoured by all. I believe in an Australia where we have a set of values which would have Mother Teresa in place of Madonna on the magazine covers; where we have a truly dynamic federalist system of government with a diffusion of power and decentralisation; and where there is a genuine support for the victims of domestic violence, youth homelessness, suicide and other social ills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My ideal Australia is one where the financial and environmental position of Australia is such that we can say to our children, `We leave you with an inheritance and not a debt, and with a clean country, not a polluted country'; where the aged and returned service people are properly cared for in recognition of their contributions; where individual responsibility for self and nation is embraced; and where there is true world peace and social harmony. I could list others, and I have not listed in any specific order the ones I have mentioned. Our dreams will be unfulfilled and our work worthless unless we acknowledge the words of Sir Robert Menzies when he said:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, since my announcement on 15 February last that Australia would recognise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM, there has been a significant increase in community tension between Australian citizens and residents of, respectively, Greek and FYROM origins. Demonstrations have been held; many provocative and inflammatory things have been said, including by some politicians; several physical clashes have occurred; and a number of vicious attacks have been made&mdash;by persons so far unidentified&mdash;on churches, parliamentary offices and other property seen to be associated with one side or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious and deeply unhappy development for a country which, rightly, prides itself as one of the world's great multicultural success stories. It is against the whole character and tradition of this country, 20 per cent of whose people were born elsewhere, with half of these coming from non-English-speaking nations. It is time for calmer and cooler heads to prevail. It is time for the words to be heeded of those community leaders on both sides who have been trying so hard in recent days to defuse the tensions. I acknowledge the presence in the gallery today of some members of one of those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for everyone, politicians included, to stop making inflammatory and provocative statements. It is time for extremists to stop distributing the kind of written propaganda that they know will outrage those with opposing views. And it is time, above all, for the acts of violence to stop. Attacks, whatever their source, on churches and other property&mdash;whether they are perpetrated by members of either community, or by others seeking for ugly reasons of their own to ignite ethnic tensions&mdash;are contemptible, cowardly and utterly un-Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unreasonable to ask, and expect, that all those who make their permanent homes in this country have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia first and foremost. The right to express one's own beliefs and to practise one's culture and religion involves a reciprocal responsibility to accept the rights and values of others, and to accept the basic structures and principles of Australian society: the constitution, the rule of law, tolerance and equality, parliamentary democracy, and freedom of speech and religion. Almost universal acceptance of these principles has for many years encouraged good sense to prevail, even during some very harrowing periods for Australians with links to particular countries overseas, and it is crucial that that commitment be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not asking anyone, from either community, to abandon long or deeply held views and convictions. But what I, the Prime Minister and Senator Bolkus have been asking each side to do, before advancing those views in ways likely to further inflame tensions, is to look at the issue from the other side's point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus we have been asking those whose origins lie in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to acknowledge frankly that their country occupies only part of the territory embraced by ancient Macedonia and that, accordingly, the use of symbols like the Star of Vergina or, more provocatively still, the White Tower of Thessaloniki, or the use of names or the circulation of maps which in effect lay claim to the whole territory and cultural heritage of ancient Macedonia are bound to be deeply offensive to any person of Greek origin who cares for the cultural and territorial heritage of his or her original homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, we have been asking those of Greek origin to recognise and acknowledge that Slav-Macedonians&mdash;those originating in the FYROM&mdash;do have legitimate claims to part of the territory and cultural heritage of ancient Macedonia, and are distressed by demands that they renounce use of the name Macedonia entirely. We have asked also that Greek Australians, and Greece itself, accept that the outstanding issues are ones that can only be resolved by peaceful negotiations, and not by confrontation and conflict. We have asked that they recognise the unfairness of FYROM being denied a recognised place in the community of nations when it does satisfy normal criteria for recognition. And we have asked that they acknowledge the unfairness of Slav-Macedonians living in Australia being denied normal consular services necessary to maintain human links with their original homeland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not always easy to look at a problem through the eyes of your traditional opponent, but it is always right to try to do so. There is invariably a measure of right and justice on both sides, and the present dispute is no exception. Responsible community leaders from both sides have been prepared to acknowledge that, even if, regrettably, sometimes only privately. I hope very much for the sake of the future of community relations and multiculturalism in this country that that approach prevails in the days and weeks ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government's position has been from the outset and remains one of acknowledging that there are two sides to this argument, and trying to balance our policy accordingly. When passions run high, of course, as they have on this issue, the only reward for attempting balance is very often to be assaulted by both sides. But we have not been, and will not be, deterred from continuing to call the balance as we think it should be called. Our responsibility, as the government of Australia, is to conduct our foreign policy in Australia's national interests, not those of any other country; just as it is our responsibility to govern for the benefit of all Australians, whatever their sex, race, or ethnic origin.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me explain the basic elements in the balance we have struck. </PARA>

Moreover, we acted only after the state had been admitted to the UN, with Greece itself one of the 63 co-sponsors, and Greece itself prepared to accept the name FYROM as appropriate for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In strict Australian foreign policy terms, that recognition had already been too long delayed. Certainly the price of further delay would have been a significant loss of foreign policy consistency and credibility. Since 1988, Australia has recognised states, not governments, and has done so on the basis not of approval or disapproval, but of four essentially objective criteria: clearly defined territorial boundaries, a permanent population, an established government, and a capacity to conduct international relations. In the case of the FYROM, these objective conditions had been satisfied more or less from the outset. Now we have formally announced recognition, delayed though that decision may have been, that recognition is irreversible as long as the state exists in its current form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia, like many other countries, delayed recognition primarily because it was thought this would encourage early resolution of the outstanding matters in dispute between the FYROM and Greece. But by 15 February this year, so many countries had recognised the state&mdash;including effectively all those with any influence on the situation&mdash;that it was impossible to pretend that Australia's withholding of recognition could amount to any form of effective leverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Minister Keating said on 3 March 1992 that Australia would not move to recognition until three further conditions&mdash;going to the issues of name, territorial aspirations and human rights&mdash;were satisfied. For all the reasons set out in detail in my statement of 15 February 1994, which I do not repeat here, I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the text of my statement at the conclusion of this statement. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of territorial aspirations, we believe that argument based on the language of the FYROM constitution should reasonably have been put fully to rest by the amendment formally adopted in 1992, which proclaimed that the country `has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states'. But to the extent that there are some continuing Greek concerns based on references in the preamble to forebears of the present state, and references in article 49 to dealings with people of FYROM-origin living outside the state, the Australian government does believe it would be helpful for the FYROM government to address these concerns. Here as elsewhere, suspicions which might otherwise have been muted have been fuelled by the continued proliferation of what can only be described as offensive irredentist propaganda, especially maps of Greater Macedonia, and the most helpful step of all would be for the spreading of that propaganda to be curbed. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Name Issue</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the criticism of the Australian government has focused on our moving to recognition in circumstances where the name issue has manifestly not been resolved to Greece's current satisfaction. But it needs to be remembered what the precise terms of the commitment made by the Prime Minister were: that Australia would not proceed to recognition without `the use of the word "Macedonia" being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece'. When Greece itself has been prepared to accept the name FYROM, at least for the purposes of admission to the United Nations, and when some 46 other countries had recognised the state using this name and without incurring more than purely formal expressions of displeasure from Athens, it was difficult to believe, in our judgment, that our act of recognition would `cause further tension' with Greece. I came away from my own ministerial consultations in Athens in January reinforced in that belief, and nothing that has happened since has given me grounds to change it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a logical consequence of recognising the state under the temporary name of the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia' or `FYROM' that Australian government departments and agencies should&mdash;unless and until present circumstances change&mdash;use that name for the state, and we will so direct them. A slightly more difficult and sensitive problem arises when it comes to identifying an appropriate name for people who live in, or originate from, the FYROM. When the Australian government does not accept the name `Republic of Macedonia' as an appropriate one for the country itself, it is simply not appropriate to refer to its people as `Macedonians', even though many of them would certainly much prefer this terminology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We propose, accordingly, that Australian government departments and agencies use the description `Slav-Macedonians' when referring to people who live in, or originate from, the FYROM. `Slav-Macedonians' is in quite common descriptive usage, and should not have any offensive connotations&mdash;other than for those to whom any qualification of the word `Macedonian' is unacceptable. It is the case that some FYROM people&mdash;including most obviously the Albanian minority&mdash;are of non-Slav ethnic origin, but `Slav' in the present context should be taken not so much as an ethnic reference but simply as shorthand for the country's name, the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not proposed that any legislation be enacted to compel any particular usage by government departments and agencies or anyone else. How ordinary members of the respective communities choose to describe themselves, and in particular how they choose to describe their ethnicity, in the census or anywhere else, will remain up to those individuals and communities themselves. We recognise, for example, that there are Australian citizens of Greek geographic origin, but not of Greek ethnic background, who may choose to identify themselves as Macedonians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in relation to those departments and agencies which the government has a capacity to direct, directions will be given to refer, for the time being, to the country as the `FYROM', and to people living in or originating from that country as `Slav-Macedonians'. In relation to the ABC and SBS, and other statutory authorities which the government has little or no capacity to direct, we can only express the hope that, in the interests of balanced community relations, they will choose to apply the same guidelines. I emphasise that all these questions of nomenclature will, of course, have to be revisited when the name issue is finally resolved, as we all hope it soon will be, in negotiations between the FYROM and Greece. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Opening of Consulate</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, one of the considerations troubling the government about our non-recognition of FYROM was that this made impossible the opening of a FYROM consulate in Australia, and this denial of access to consular services was causing real inconvenience, and occasionally real hardship, to those 75,000 Australians of FYROM origin who wanted to maintain direct human links with their original homeland. Recognition was necessary to clear the way for consular relations to be established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, however, made it clear&mdash;both in my 15 February statement and in subsequent communications to Skopje&mdash;that the opening of a FYROM consulate in Australia can only be contemplated if certain conditions are satisfied; namely, that it describe itself appropriately as the consulate of the `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', not as the `Republic of Macedonia', and that no contentious flag or other symbol be displayed pending the final resolution of outstanding issues. The imposition of conditions of this kind&mdash;which would enable the consulate to operate without any practical difficulty, but not in a way which generated new flashpoints for reaction&mdash;is not inconsistent with international law governing consular practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the moment, however, the FYROM side has indicated that it has real difficulties in meeting the conditions we have set. Until it overcomes those difficulties and meets the stated conditions, the matter can be taken no further. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Entering into diplomatic relations is a distinct further step that remains to be taken between Australia and the FYROM. Just as one country can recognise another without establishing any consular relations, so too can recognition and consular relations occur, but without formal diplomatic relations. Australia has no present intention to enter into diplomatic relations with the FYROM. As was made clear in my statement on 15 February, although we have indicated our willingness to enter into discussions about such relations, it would be premature to address this issue until the consular issue is resolved.</PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">International Activity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in everyone's interests that the matters which continue to be disputed between Greece and the FYROM be resolved as soon as possible, and by peaceful negotiation. Australia's capacity to influence that process is necessarily limited, but we remain ready to assist in any way we can. Some two years ago we actively promoted, between the parties and in the United Nations, the idea that recognition of the FYROM proceed on the basis of a temporary formula for the name, leaving final resolution of the substantive issue for consideration at a later date. Some elements of that proposal are evident in the acceptance by the international community of FYROM as a temporary name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remain in regular contact with the UN mediator, Cyrus Vance, and have made clear to him, and to Athens and Skopje, Australia's willingness to make any diplomatic contribution that would help their negotiation efforts. The fact that we&mdash;to my knowledge alone among the international community&mdash;have set such stringent conditions on the establishment of a consulate is certainly seen in a number of quarters as applying a useful diplomatic discipline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made it very clear in our public statements that we believe that there is more the FYROM government, for a start, can do to advance the rapid peaceful settlement of this issue. The claim to the Star of Vergina as a national symbol is untenable and should be dropped. Some compromise should be accepted on the name issue. There are many potential formulae which would retain some reference to Macedonia without appropriating that name in its entirety. Action should be taken to halt the distribution, to the extent this is within the FYROM government's power, of offensive irredentist propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those provisions of the FYROM constitution which continue to cause concern in Greece should be addressed again. While recognising all of President Gligorov's parliamentary difficulties, at the very least it would be extremely helpful if the government in Skopje were to announce, now, its intention to take steps to change the flag and to make agreed constitutional amendments on the name and related issues as soon as the necessary two-thirds parliamentary majority was obtainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greek side has its own important contribution to make to the peaceful settlement of this dispute. The blockade it is presently applying on the movement of goods into the FYROM is untenable, unsustainable and should be lifted immediately. The government of Greece should expressly indicate its willingness to negotiate a compromise outcome on the name issue&mdash;one which includes some reference, albeit qualified by one or more other words, to Macedonia. It should indicate its willingness to enter into serious and constructive negotiations on these and other outstanding issues immediately and without preconditions. We in the Australian government will continue to take every opportunity we can to urge both sides immediately down this path of reasoned, moderate discussion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have, as a government, exactly the same commitment when it comes to the domestic discussion of this issue. My colleague Senator Bolkus, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, has been giving some close consideration to how the community relations resources of this country might be further mobilised, in a systematic and focused way, to try to reduce some of the tensions which are currently evident. He is in the process of developing some community relations initiatives aimed generally at getting a better understanding on all sides of the issues and principles involved, and in particular at getting the media and the relevant communities together to discuss the portrayal of the respective cultures and the scope for better appreciation of them. The government will be discussing with community representatives&mdash;at both official and ministerial level&mdash;how these and other possible initiatives might be best progressed, and Senator Bolkus will make a further statement on these matters in due course. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">M11                                          15 February 1994 </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA (FYROM)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has decided to recognise as an independent state, and to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Australia will refer to the Republic as "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" (FYROM), the temporary name used in the UN and for membership of some international agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FYROM has been formally recognised by some 59 states (including, last week, the United States of America). Along with 62 other countries, including Greece, Australia co-sponsored the admission of the FYROM to the UN in April 1993. According to the practice of many of those co-sponsors, recognition of the FYROM flowed automatically from support for its admission to the UN; for Australia, recognition required a separate formal act, and that step has now been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I assured the Greek Government during my visit to Athens last month, in recognising the FYROM, Australia makes no presumption as to the final outcome of the "name" issue, or any other issue involved in negotiations between Greece and the Republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do believe those negotiations would be much assisted by the Government in Skopje ceasing to use the "Star of Vergina" symbol on the FYROM's flag; forebearing from using the name "Republic of Macedonia" until a mutually acceptable final resolution of the name issue is achieved; addressing the provisions of FYROM's Constitution which continue to cause concern in Greece; and taking all possible steps to curb the proliferation, at home and abroad, of offensive irredentist propaganda. We urge the Government of the FYROM to act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government also stands ready to enter into diplomatic relations with the FYROM, joining, among many others in this respect, all of Greece's major European partners. We will consider a request from the authorities in Skopje to open a Consulate in Australia which will be able to provide a full range of needed consular services to the local community (some 75,000 people) in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have instructed the Australian Embassy in Belgrade to pursue the necessary practical arrangements. Our agreement to the opening of a FYROM Consulate in Australia would be subject to the conditions that it describe itself appropriately (as the Consulate of the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", not as the "Republic of Macedonia"), and that no contentious flag or other symbol be displayed pending final resolution of relevant outstanding issues. Our early agreement to the opening of a Consulate would be much assisted by a statement on the public record by the Government of the FYROM that it is prepared to act immediately, or at least as soon as the necessary legislative majority is achievable, to change the country's flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 3 March 1992, Prime Minister Keating identified three matters about which Australia would need to be satisfied before proceeding to recognition. We believe, in the light of the course of events since then and our discussions with relevant governments, that these conditions are now met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the first of these matters&mdash;"the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in the way that does not cause further tension with Greece"&mdash;the situation is that while the name issue has still not been finally resolved, it has been satisfactorily settled for the time being by the international community (including Greece itself) accepting for various purposes the temporary name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the second matter&mdash;"Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met"&mdash;the amendment to the FYROM's Constitution in July 1992 (spelling out that the country "has no territorial pretentions towards any neighbouring states"), together with President Gligorov's restatements (most recently on 10 February 1994) of Skopje's acceptance of existing boundaries between the two countries, has reinforced the earlier conclusion of the Badinter Commission that FYROM had no territorial aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And as to the third matter&mdash;"the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied"&mdash;the recognition action now taken by so many European and other countries has signified acceptance of the Badinter Commission's findings that FYROM's constitutional guarantees on human rights are comparable with the rest of Europe and satisfy recognition standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is pleased to note the calmer and more constructive atmosphere that has been apparent, in recent times, in discussion of the issues which remain outstanding between Greece and the FYROM. The fact that the two states are geographical neighbours makes it necessary that they be able to deal with each other on a daily basis with mutual respect and confidence. We hope and expect that it will be possible for the outstanding issues to be amicably resolved in the not too distant future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), I put it on the record in case there is any doubt that this side of the chamber deplores violence and communal violence, any violence in fact, and is firmly of the view that, no matter what the stress or provocation, such violence is un-Australian and totally unacceptable within our community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I turn to the minister's statement. There is no doubt that the government has made an awful mess of this issue, complex though it is. On reading the last few sentences of the minister's statement, which states in part, `governments can only do so much', one could only reflect on the errors that this government&mdash;particularly the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Foreign Minister&mdash;has made that required a ministerial statement today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government made the decision a few weeks ago to recognise the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia it did not bring down a ministerial statement in this place; it simply did it by press release. The government just announced to the press what would happen; apparently without any understanding&mdash;one would hope this is giving the government the benefit of the doubt&mdash;of the degree of sensitivity to the issue within the Greek community and within the former Yugoslav community. One would have expected that if the government had understood the very deep and passionate concern that so many have, there would have been a full process of consultation with both sides of the now Australian community involved, to minimise any misunderstandings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have expected many of the things we heard in this statement today to come out as a result of that process of consultation&mdash;before the government took any action of recognition. But, in a way that is so typical of this government, that did not occur. It simply dictated an outcome to the Australian community&mdash;whether it be to the Greek community or to the community of former Yugoslavia&mdash;and they had to cop it and the consequences. I think it is that lack of consultation and understanding of the sensitivity of the issue that has led to so much distress regarding this matter in the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make no mistake: Greek Australians feel that they have been betrayed. Their trust has been betrayed by this government, and in particular by Mr Keating and Senator Evans. They feel betrayed because of the specific undertakings given to them by Mr Keating and reiterated by Senator Evans in this chamber, which were conveniently forgotten at the time the government made the decision to recognise the FYROM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, the government has sought to rationalise its decision with an argument that those preconditions had been met. I will detail a little later the reasons they have not been met. That sense of betrayal is felt very deeply. It is quite legitimate for Greek Australians to go out onto the streets and, in a peaceful way, demonstrate their distress at being treated in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now compounded its error by, in effect, also betraying the trust of the former Yugoslavs. To designate them now for political purposes with this convenient tag of Slav-Macedonian whether or not they are racially or ethnically Slav people is highly offensive. Was there a process of consultation with these people before the government decided to name them in such terms and before it in an unprecedented way informed government departments that this was the way in which they were to be referred in future? No, in fact, this seems to have come out of the consultation, which occurred after the event, with the Greek community last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever there was a demonstration as to how to offend two major communities within our Australian society it has been demonstrated by the way in which the foreign minister and the Prime Minister have handled this matter. So now we have two deeply distressed communities within the Australian society instead of one deeply distressed community within our society, as we had a week or so ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of course has now been forced in a damage control and damage minimisation way after the event to come in here and put down a ministerial statement to, in effect, reassure both communities of its good faith. I do not mind the government doing that because when we see the level of distress within the community it has a responsibility to do something, but what is so regrettable is that this was in many ways so unnecessary. It could, to a large extent, have been avoided by sound government practice, which was not demonstrated by the Keating government in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sensitivity and consultation in difficult circumstances were the least that these communities had the right to expect from the Australian government, particularly from Mr Keating, and from his foreign minister, Senator Evans. That sensitivity was not shown. That consultation was not entered into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber acknowledge that there are difficult sets of issues that arise out of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia. They have been there now for some years. What is the appropriate time to recognise new states? I remember when Salvinia seemed to fulfil the four termed preconditions to recognition, which Senator Gareth Evans referred to, as required in international law. But the Australian government paused for a little while because it had to also consider whether recognition at that time enhanced a process of building stability within a very difficult region or whether in fact it could be detrimental. The Australian government presumably addressed the issue of recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an independent state in the same light&mdash;not simply considering whether it met the four international law criteria but whether a decision to that effect would enhance the stability or whether it could provide further problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why I am giving Mr Keating the benefit of the doubt. He said back in 1992 that the government would not recognise the new state until basically issues with Greece over the question of the name had been settled because he, presumably, did not want to inflame further tension. He said on 3 March 1992 that the first of the preconditions was `the use of the word "Macedonia" being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So giving him the benefit of the doubt, that is what he had in mind when he put down that precondition. If I was not to give him the benefit of that doubt, I would have said that it was a precondition and that the three preconditions were simply put on at that time to suit the political needs of the moment. If I can recall correctly that was in the period in the lead up to the Victorian state election when there was community debate on this issue of recognition and Mr Keating wanted to put down a position that reassured Greek Australians that the Australian government would not act unless certain preconditions, three in particular, were met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, as I said, giving him that benefit of the doubt, if that was the reason then it is equally true today. It is probably why Canada has not yet acted to recognise. Some states have, some states have not. I think only about a third of the states of the United Nations have so acted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is not really what this debate today is all about, because there are the international relations aspects and there are also the domestic aspects. That latter issue is really the subject of this debate: how to move to a particular position in international relations that does not cause communal disharmony within our society. Probably one of the principal responsibilities of the Australian government is that it must have concern as to how its actions will be interpreted and acted upon in turn within the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no secret that that is one of the reasons why the Australian forces are not contributing to certain UN involvements in the former Yugoslavia. It is very difficult for Australia to do that when it has such large communities of Croats, of Serbs, of those from the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and so on. The government quite rightly has to ask itself not only whether it will be constructively contributing to the resolution of a conflict in that area of the world&mdash;the Balkans&mdash;but also how it will affect communal relations in Australia. That latter consideration, which we suggest is absolutely vital to this chamber, was overlooked by the Australian government when it decided to move on this issue without any adequate consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation where the Australian government today tries to rescue itself politically. That is really what this statement is all about. The government is simply trying to rescue itself from a difficult political mess that is of its own making; a mess that I would suggest has been worsened by the decisions that have come out of the meetings of last week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us take one other example. A further reason that the minister gave for acting last month on the recognition was that there were some 75,000 Australians formerly of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia who deserved consular representation. Yet the minister now tells us that, because of the conditions to be imposed, consular representation is not likely to be afforded. Conditions have been imposed that will not be accepted by the government of the state that Australia now recognises. I would have thought that that is inconsistent; we cannot have it both ways. I understand the argument for the restraints that the minister has included. I do not mind his putting that argument on the usage of names and symbols and so forth, because their use also inflames the communities within Australia. But he cannot at the same time say that he is doing it in order that a consulate might be open to afford these people facilities that they do not currently have. That would seem to be simply an argument of convenience&mdash;and when one examines it, it is found to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this situation where the government has acted for domestic political purposes. It has sought to rescue a situation that is unnecessary and of its making. It has, rather sadly, simply further inflamed communal tensions within our society as a result of this statement. Therefore, there is very little positive that we can say about what is before us today. We issued today through our foreign affairs spokesman a statement deploring this reference to those who are of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia simply as Slav-Macedonians, and rejecting the explanation that was given by Senator Evans in his statement that `Slav' in this context should simply be taken as shorthand for the country's name, not so much as an ethnic reference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of how Senator Evans says they should interpret it; it is a question of how they interpret it themselves. Normally when one changes one's name in this country, it is with consent. But the people concerned were given no opportunity for consent. In typical fashion, Senator Evans simply said, `This will be how you are to be described, but don't take offence because we are not intending that you should take offence'. That is simply not good enough. It demonstrates how little the government has learnt throughout this whole sad sequence of events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will go down as one of the saddest chapters in history in terms of a contribution by an Australian government towards communal harmony. We boast about this country's multicultural society. But we say to Senator Evans that if we encourage a multicultural society&mdash;in other words, if we encourage and facilitate the people who come to this country in maintaining their traditional cultures and beliefs; I support that&mdash;we have to recognise the dangers in doing so. The old tensions and rivalries and passions will come with it. When we as governments deal with people in those circumstances and make decisions that affect and inflame those passions, we should be sensitive to the likely consequences. We should ensure that the decisions we make minimise the potential damage and the potential communal stress rather than build upon them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am pleased that the government has finally come into this chamber with a statement explaining its actions, I regret very much the way in which it has handled this matter. It will not go down as a success story. It will go down as one of the messiest applications of international relations policy when applied to domestic society that we have ever experienced in my time in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support very strongly the words of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill. The statement delivered today by Senator Gareth Evans was a rather crude and disingenuous attempt on the part of the government to get itself off a very dangerous hook which I remind the Senate, as did Senator Hill, is entirely of the government's own making. In particular, it is a hook which was baited by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) two years ago on 3 March 1992 for purely cynical, opportunistic vote-buying reasons. That hook was swallowed and the government was caught on the line of its own opportunism and ineptitude with Senator Evans's statement one month ago on 15 February:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has decided to recognise as an independent state, and to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Evans went on to say, that state will be referred to as FYROM, the temporary name used in the United Nations and for membership of some international agencies. In his statement today, Senator Evans specifically acknowledged that, as a result of his statement, further elements of which I shall raise later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been a significant increase in community tension between Australian citizens and residents of, respectively, Greek and FYROM origins.</PARA>
<PARA>They are his words. That is what he says has been the result of his statement of 15 February 1994. The coalition agrees completely with the minister, to use his words:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious and deeply unhappy development for a country which, rightly, prides itself as one of the world's great multicultural success stories.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans might also have added that Australia is one of the most tolerant, law-abiding and peace loving nations on earth. The minister rightly calls for calm and cool heads to prevail. He rightly demands the cessation of attacks on churches and property by whoever are the perpetrators, including those who for their own ugly reasons may be seeking to ignite ethnic tensions&mdash;again to use the words of Senator Evans. He says that those actions and those people are contemptible, cowardly and utterly un-Australian. Senator Evans rightly asks that all of us who make our permanent homes in this country&mdash;and, I interpose, whatever our country of origin, whether we are fifth generation, first generation or overseas born Australians&mdash;to quote Senator Evans, `have an overriding and unifying commitment to Australia first and foremost'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such a fundamental principle has always been the cornerstone of the Liberal-National Party policy in this area. Within that overriding, unifying commitment, however, we also freely accept that all people in Australia have the right to preserve and disseminate their cultural heritage. But the term `cultural heritage' can surely never be interpreted to include wanton acts of violence. I know of no Australian resident or citizen who thinks otherwise. Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time for everyone, politicians included, to stop making inflammatory and provocative statements.</PARA>
<PARA>I agree. From his answers to questions in the Senate two weeks ago, it is clear that he would put coalition spokesmen, including me, in the category of persons having made such statements. I categorically refute such assertions. Senator Evans has always been a great one for blaming everyone else when something goes wrong, and this particular issue has gone badly wrong since his statement on 15 February 1994. He can never accept that his government might indeed be the prime culprit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have news for Senator Evans: on this issue, it is the government alone&mdash;and Senator Evans and the Prime Minister in particular&mdash;which has been directly, solely responsible for the damaging, dangerous, repugnant and totally unacceptable increase in community tension and acts of violence. This has been as a result of the handling by the Prime Minister and Senator Evans of the extremely sensitive and delicate subject of the use of the word `Macedonia' and the recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, FYROM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me emphasise unequivocally that the root of this problem is not the taking of sides between Greece on the one hand and FYROM on the other. It is not about supporting in Australia either Australians of Greek origin or Australians of FYROM origin. It is not about whether Australia recognises states rather than governments. It is not about whether, in the case of FYROM, the four internationally accepted objective criteria for recognition of states&mdash;namely, clearly defined territorial boundaries; a permanent population; an established government; and a capacity to conduct international relations&mdash;have been satisfied as I believe they have. The central issue is not about those things. The central issue is the fact that the Keating government, through the statement of Senator Evans on 15 February, broke a solemn promise that it made two years ago to the Australian community as a whole but directed particularly to the Australian community of Greek background that Australia would recognise FYROM only if three additional preconditions were met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those preconditions were laid down in writing by the then relatively new Prime Minister, Mr Keating, on 3 March 1992. Those three conditions, I remind the Senate, were, firstly, the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece; secondly, Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met; and, thirdly, the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister had no compelling reason to lay down these additional preconditions for recognition other than the base political reason that he was seeking to shore up the vote of the Greek Australian community. That is what it was all about&mdash;simple, basic, base, opportunistic, cynical politics. It is all very well for Senator Gareth Evans to come in here today in his normal arrogant, pompous, pious way and proclaim to us that the government's responsibility is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to conduct our foreign policy in Australia's national interests, not those of any other country, just as it is our responsibility to govern for the benefit of all Australians, whatever their sex, race, or ethnic origin.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans is correct; that is the responsibility of the government. The only problem is that in this government's hands those fine sentiments are just so many hollow words. To the government's great shame and to Australia's great misfortune, those words are observed in the breach by this government. `Say one thing, do the opposite'. That is the hallmark, that is the stamp, of this government. `Do not worry about solemn promises; just make them, then break them whenever the politics of opportunism demands'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end, governments that act in this way get caught out. That is precisely what has happened to this government over its promised preconditions to recognition of FYROM. The government on 15 February 1994 recognised FYROM, despite the fact that the Prime Minister's three absolutely self-imposed preconditions had not been met&mdash;certainly not in their entirety and arguably not at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has been at pains today and on previous occasions to attempt to defend the indefensible by asserting that those three preconditions have actually been fulfilled. I will not insult the Senate by repeating these patent falsehoods. My colleague Senator Hill has already refuted them admirably and comprehensively. But I draw the Senate's attention to one or two aspects of Senator Evans's attempted defence of the government's actions. On page 4 of the statement, on the question of territorial aspirations, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we believe that argument based on the language of the FYROM Constitution should reasonably have been put fully to rest by the amendment formally adopted in 1992, which proclaimed that the country "has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states".</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans goes on in the next sentence of his statement to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But to the extent that there are some continuing Greek concerns based on references in the Preamble to forebears of the present state, and references in Article 49 to dealings with people of FYROM-origin living outside the state, the Australian Government does believe it would be helpful for the FYROM Government to address these concerns. Here as elsewhere, suspicions which might otherwise have been muted have been fuelled by the continued proliferation of offensive irredentist propaganda, especially maps of "Greater Macedonia", and the most helpful step of all would be for the spreading of that propaganda to be curbed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My friends Senator Teague and Senator Knowles pointed out what I was about to point out. There is a basic internal contradiction. He has contradicted himself. There is a tacit acceptance in what Senator Evans has said that this precondition on the question of territorial aspirations has not been met. Yet day in and day out the Prime Minister and Senator Evans assert baldly that all the preconditions have been met and therefore there were no broken promises on the government's part. The minister in his own statement contradicts that view. The following paragraph in his statement deals with the name issue. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the criticism of the Australian government has focused on our moving to recognition in circumstances where the name issue has manifestly not been resolved to Greece's current satisfaction.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But it needs to be remembered what the precise terms of the commitment made by the Prime Minister were: that Australia would not proceed to recognition without `the use of the word Macedonia being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece'.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, there seems to me to be a monumental internal inconsistency in what the minister is saying. He goes on to justify the argument by saying we have not heard `more than purely formal expressions of displeasure from Athens'. What weasel words are they? They are designed to deliberately mislead the Australian community as to what the actual situation is. It is quite clear that the first precondition of the Prime Minister, namely, that the name situation not cause further tensions for Greece, has not been met. He accepts here that that has not been met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go on finding similar internal inconsistencies in what the minister has said. But not only has the government broken its promises to the Australian community of Greek origin; it has also now deeply offended many Australians whose background lies in FYROM. Both the Australian community of Greek origin and the Australian community of FYROM origin are understandably dismayed and hurt&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;that this arrogant government went ahead with its recognition of FYROM on 15 February without any meaningful prior consultation at all with either community. It then took more than three weeks before the Prime Minister, Senator Evans and Senator Bolkus condescended even to meet with the representatives of the Greek-Australian community, and it took another week, until this morning, to meet with representatives of the Australian community of FYROM background. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was a purely token meeting because the government had already decided what Senator Evans was going to say in his statement this afternoon. So I say to members of the Australian community of FYROM background that it has been desperately let down on two counts: it was not consulted, and  when it eventually was consulted, what the government was going to say was a fait accompli and nothing that the community could have said to the government this morning would have had any meaningful effect on changing the government's statement of this afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of the arrogance of the government's approach in this matter, we now have a situation where this government is dictating to government agencies and departments that the word to be used in relation to Australians of FYROM background will be Slav-Macedonians. That is a very deeply offensive term to all of those people but, in particular&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Teague" NAMEID="PJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator Teague</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is offensive to the minorities, for sure.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In particular it is offensive to the  minorities who comprise up to 40 per cent of the population of the state. The Albanian community comprises well in excess of 20 per cent, and there are other minorities as well. If one adds them together, it will give one a figure in the order of 30 to 40 per cent. I find it absolutely extraordinary and offensive to call them all `Slav-Macedonians' and do it on the basis that has been done today by Senator Evans. I deeply deplore it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A spokesman from the community, Mr Jim Tomev, was quoted last week as saying&mdash;when it looked as if this was what was going to happen&mdash;the government was creating an act of `cultural genocide'. It is a very strong term, and I do not know whether I would necessarily use it, but it is one which shows just how deeply offended the community in Australia is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other comments in the minister's statement which I will refer to briefly. Senator Evans is either quite off the rails or he is telling less than the full truth. For example, on page 3 under the sub-heading, `The Act of Recognition' he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia moved to recognise the FYROM only after 58 other countries had done so, including every member of the European Union and the United States. Moreover, we acted only after the state had been admitted to the UN, with Greece itself one of the 63 co-sponsors, and Greece itself prepared to accept the name "FYROM" as appropriate for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA>At best, that is a half truth. For a start, as Senator Hill rightly said, it ignores something like two-thirds of the members of the United Nations who have not accepted or recognised FYROM, including particularly Canada. It also omits to say that the present Papandreou Greek government, which was not in office at the time Greece jointly co-sponsored admission to the UN, is violently opposed to the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, Senator Evans should do this chamber the courtesy of making that clear. To pick up another statement, Senator Evans also went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia, like many other countries, delayed recognition primarily because it was thought this would encourage early resolution of the outstanding matters in dispute between the FYROM and Greece. But by 15 February this year, so many countries had recognised the state&mdash;including effectively all those with any influence on the situation&mdash;that it was impossible to pretend that Australia's withholding recognition could amount to any form of effective leverage.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether that is right or not&mdash;it may be&mdash;but whether it is is quite irrelevant because the Prime Minister and the government should have thought of that point before it laid down its three self-imposed preconditions two years ago. If that was going to be one of the key factors in the government's thinking, then either it was very foolish when it laid down those preconditions in March 1992, or it should have had the honesty to spell out its motivations at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not take up the time of the Senate much longer, but I want to stress two other points from the document. On page 6, under the heading of `Diplomatic Relations', the minister says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has no present intention to enter into diplomatic relations with FYROM: although (as made clear in my statement on 15 February) we have indicated our willingness to enter into discussions about such relations, it would be premature to address this issue until the consular question is resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>That is not what the 15 February statement said. The first sentence said, `We have decided today, No. 1, to recognise FYROM, and No. 2, to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with FYROM'. I repeat: to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with FYROM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a world of difference between that and what the minister said today. Today he was saying that we have no present intention of entering into diplomatic relations with FYROM. That is the same as saying that we have no present intention to enter into discussions. Surely that is the only reasonable interpretation that one could make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I do not know whether the minister had a mental block about what he said on 15 February, two months ago, when he started this whole dreadful situation, but it is totally misleading to make such a statement today. I am absolutely amazed, and I deplore the fact that he has made such a gross misrepresentation&mdash;for whatever reason he may have done it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other comment about his statement that I would pick up is his remark on page 7, under the sub-heading of `Community Relations Activity'. In the course of his words there he says that Senator Bolkus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is in the process of developing some community relations initiatives aimed generally at getting a better understanding on all sides of the issues and principles involved . . .</PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. For that we should read that Senator Bolkus is developing some initiatives that are basically designed to be straight Labor propaganda to win back the Greek Australian vote and the vote of Australians of FYROM background that its deplorable handling of this situation over the last month and more must surely have lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in summary, as a result of the government's opportunistic, totally politically driven approach to this issue of the recognition of FYROM, going back to the Prime Minister's statement of 3 March 1992, the government has effectively let down the Australian community of Greek background; it has let down in an equally offensive way&mdash;indeed in some ways more offensively&mdash;the Australian community whose background is in the region of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It has let down the whole Australian community, because the whole Australian community is vitally interested in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a matter that just affects certain sections of the Australian community; it is a matter that affects the whole of the Australian community. It goes to the core of our unity as a nation, and it goes to the whole core of Australia as a truly multicultural society. The government's handling of this matter has put a very grave dent in community perceptions and the reality of our multicultural society&mdash;a society for which the government continually seeks to claim the credit, despite the fact, I might point out, that it was the former Liberal-National Party governments, and particularly the Fraser government, to which much of that credit is due. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first point I want to make is that the Australian Democrats remain acutely disappointed with the way in which this issue has been handled in certain quarters in this country. The debate on what is a very complicated subject has certainly not been assisted by the inflammatory and ill-considered remarks by some who have chosen to involve themselves in the issue. Some comments have clearly exacerbated tensions in the community, and we regret that fact. This could well have been avoided.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the Democrats today welcome the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) on the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the detail he has presented on the current status of the issue as far as the government is concerned. In particular we welcome the minister's endorsement of the principles underlying Australia's longstanding policy of multiculturalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the last few decades multiculturalism has been a central philosophy in Australia. Since 1977, when the Australian Democrats were formed, we have been strong supporters of multicultural policies, and we reiterate that support today. As the minister said in his statement, we should pride ourselves that multiculturalism has been a success story in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against this background it is most unfortunate that in recent weeks we have witnessed the various acts of vandalism and other forms of attack against both communities and their properties, particularly in Melbourne and Canberra. Such attacks are totally unacceptable, and the Democrats sincerely hope that the legal and judicial processes in this country will be able to run their full course in relation to these deplorable events. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats join with others on both sides of this chamber, including Senator Short, who has just spoken, in pleading with leaders of both communities and, in fact, all of us to calm down to help attempts to reduce the tensions which now exist over this issue. We should remember that we are Australians first. The sorts of violent actions we have witnessed in recent weeks are, if anything, absolutely not Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever an issue involved shades of grey, the current dispute over the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is it. In recent months all Democrat senators, and I am sure most of us in here, have been bombarded with reams of correspondence over this issue. Much of it has been written in a style and language that has been far from helpful or constructive. I believe that in this issue, like in many other disputes of similar dimensions, the correspondents could have assisted themselves and their case if they had been prepared to recognise at least that no one issue is as black or as white as they like to believe or as they want others to believe. It would be helpful if, as the minister suggests, members of both communities attempted to look at this contentious issue from each other's perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats join with the government in stating our belief that there is certainly a measure of right and justice on both sides of this dispute. We would all do well to remember that no-one has a total monopoly on truth. I for one was intrigued to learn from the minister that responsible community leaders from both sides have privately been prepared to acknowledge that fact. That is very encouraging. It is interesting to know that this is the case, and perhaps it helps to explain the motivation behind some statements in recent days, although we again urge community leaders to exercise such a view more forcefully in public statements which they are making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We welcome the content and the general thrust of the minister's statement. We believe it is appropriately well-balanced and the government is to be commended for that approach. We are hopeful that the statement will clarify issues for all Australians in a positive and helpful way. In the meantime the Democrats keenly await the outcome of the considerations currently being given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, on how community relations resources might be better utilised in reducing current community tensions in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the end there can be no better recommendation for displays of tolerance and understanding than to look closely at what is currently happening in all the former republics of Yugoslavia. We certainly do not need to import to Australia the sorts of intolerance and prejudiced attitudes that have plagued the Yugoslav conflict and have prevented an easy peace settlement. In fact, many people from the former republics of Yugoslavia have, when contacting my office in recent months, expressed their horror at the events in their former homelands and expressed gratitude for the fact that they now live in a country where there is peace and tolerance. </PARA>

I hope I have not misrepresented him in saying that. To the best of my knowledge, no other leader or opposition spokesperson who has spoken on this matter has indicated that the opposition will overturn the decision to recognise FYROM. I waited in vain for somebody to say that. Yet we heard the Australian government being criticised for an hour for being pro-active in this situation. In my ignorance, I still cannot understand what Australia has done wrong in recognising FYROM, as Greece itself had already done so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to add to this debate on the ministerial statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) which deals with the recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I take up some of Senator McKiernan's points in terms of the language that has been used by some in this debate, but more importantly, the way that has been reported. I was disgusted last week at the total and utter irresponsibility of the media saying&mdash;in their effort to protect the Labor government from by-election damage&mdash;that using the words `betrayal of the Greek community' is inflaming violence. As I say, that is totally and utterly disgusting of any media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Robert Hill, has said here tonight, it is not now just the Greek community who have been betrayed by this government; it is also the community of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. The commitments given by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) back on 3 March 1992 were not fulfilled. If it is somehow disgraceful to say in today's political language that communities have been betrayed, if a hysterical media with another agenda says that that is inciting violence, then we have to seriously question the role of the media in this country and the way the media is inflaming a situation that is not inflammatory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has always urged restraint by all players. It has never encouraged any violence and would never seek to do so. We, as the founders of multiculturalism in this country, firmly believe that there is a responsibility on every person who comes to the country not only to be a law-abiding citizen, but also to benefit from the wealth this country has to offer. Therefore, it is wrong and untruthful for the media, or anybody else for that matter, to suggest or imply that the coalition is trying to incite violence of any type. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a shame that this ministerial statement today  still does not answer many of the questions that are uppermost in the minds of the Greek and the FYROM communities. It is a shame that those of the FYROM community were not consulted until this morning. Let us face it: a statement was put out by Senator Evans as a consequence of the Greek community's consultations on 10 March which is identical in every way, shape and form to the statement that has been made here today. Therefore, what input has the FYROM community had, and what input prior to 10 March has the Greek community had? As I said, not just one community has been betrayed by this government; both have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite clearly, on 3 March 1992, the Prime Minister&mdash;as has already been said by Senators Hill and Short&mdash;made the conditions for purely political reasons. Yet he knew that he had no desire whatsoever to fulfil those conditions in the long term. I will quote again the exact words that he used in describing these conditions. He said that the first condition was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece</PARA>
<PARA>The second was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met</PARA>
<PARA>The third was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied</PARA>
<PARA>It is a shame that those conditions were laid down for purely political reasons and that the Prime Minister had no intention whatsoever of fulfilling them. Until 15 February both communities felt that there was going to be a full and comprehensive debate on these conditions prior to any recognition, and they had a complete and utter right to think that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, as has been said by me and others before me, their hopes and aspirations were betrayed. It is quite improper to state, as both the minister and other people have, that the Greek government has been part of the agreement. The Prime Minister has made factual errors in his interpretation of what has happened and what has been agreed to by other governments. Senator Gareth Evans's statement of 15 February made no reference to the core criteria&mdash;on the contrary, his statement clearly alleged that Australia had recognised the FYROM because the Prime Minister's own conditions had then been met. In 1992 the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the intention of that state to recognise itself as the Republic of Macedonia. It now recognises itself as the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is simply wrong. On 9 February, President Gligorov used the name Republic of Macedonia, without any modification, three times in the opening paragraph of his statement on the US recognition of the FYROM. The Prime Minister was telling only part of the story when he said that Greece had co-sponsored the entry of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, under that name, to the United Nations. He failed to say that Greece did so as a temporary measure on the understanding that it would be of limited duration and, also, he failed to say that it now vehemently rejects it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the FYROM was admitted to the UN in April 1993 there was an expectation that it and Greece would be able to report by September 1993 to the UN Secretary-General that they had resolved their differences over the name issue. No such resolution has been forthcoming. The Greek government continues to refer, including in the United Nations context, to the FYROM of Skopje. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need to look at is who is telling the truth. There is a constant blind of both communities and the government hoping that no-one will see through what they are doing. Quite frankly, with Senator Evans further confusing the situation today, it is clear that the government does not know where it is going. I find it absolutely fascinating that Senator Evans, in his statement today said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of territorial aspirations, we believe that argument based on the language of the FYROM Constitution should reasonably have been put fully to rest by the amendment formally adopted in 1992, which proclaimed that the country "has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states".</PARA>
<PARA>But then he contradicts himself. As Senator Short said earlier, the contradiction is just stunning because in this statement Senator Evans went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But to the extent that there are some continuing Greek concerns based on references in the Preamble to forebears of the present state, and references in Article 49 to dealings with the people of FYROM-origin living outside the state, the Australian Government does believe it would be helpful for the FYROM Government to address these concerns.  </PARA>
<PARA>Is that not a contradiction of what Senator Evans is trying to tell these communities; that the situation has been resolved? I will repeat condition No. 1. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece". </PARA>
<PARA>On page 4 he made a statement in this context. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When Greece itself has been prepared to accept the name `FYROM', at least for the purposes of admission to the United Nations&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it goes on. What he is still neglecting to say is that that is a former government, not the current government; and the situation is not as he is portraying it here&mdash;and there has been no such acceptance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further confusion is then caused by calling those of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, `Slav-Macedonians'. The minister recognises that there is a difficulty with that and yet he is saying that this should be so. How can the minister quite responsibly say that this is what people must be called, when he recognises that there are difficulties? How objectionable is it to the minorities in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to be called Slav-Macedonians? That is not what they want. So why is this government yet again forcing its opinion&mdash;without agreement&mdash;on a community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to recognise the fact that there has been no agreement on symbols, for example. The Star of Vergina is a very sacred symbol to the Greek community and it has requested, for as long as I have been part of this debate and longer, that that star not be used. Therefore, the Greek community, along with the FYROM community, is entitled to think that there would be some resolution to that question before a decision is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans in his typical bombastic way is simply saying that the claim to the Star of Vergina as a national symbol is untenable and should be dropped; that some compromise should be accepted on the name issue; and that there are many potential formulae which would retain some reference to Macedonia without appropriating that name in its entirety. Once again, there is a further degree of uncertainty between these two communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with one other thing that Senator McKiernan said, that there are leaders of both communities who have shown extreme responsibility and restraint over this entire issue. I too, like Senator McKiernan, am from Western Australia and I have to say that the leaders in Western Australia have just been outstanding in ensuring that there is no violence and that sanity prevails, because those leaders in the communities not only in Western Australia but right throughout Australia recognise the importance of being Australians first. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those people recognise that they are Australians first, that is a very significant factor to the rest of Australians from wherever they come because they too do not want to see any violence that originates in another land. I want to ensure that those leaders of both communities who have acted in such a responsible way to ensure that this situation is resolved properly are not disappointed. They are fully entitled to feel disappointed to the extreme at the moment. I hope that they will not be ignored in the future, that they will not be betrayed again by a government which makes commitments that it simply has no intention of keeping. Those leaders need to be congratulated, and I hope that they can now pull in the reins on a few of their dissidents who are causing some terror in certain parts of Australia. Australians will not tolerate that and I know those from these two communities who are part of Australia will also not tolerate that and that they also seek to have those people brought to justice. </PARA>

The government has been in discussions quite recently with leaders of various communities in this country. I believe when the government sought to have this statement made and then announced that it had been made that it thought it was going to be announcing a great success.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement seeks to blame everybody else but the government for the woes which have been visited upon this country. The one thing this statement lacks which should have been included in it is an apology by the government for the statement originally made in 1992 by the Prime Minister, which led the Greek-Australian community to believe that certain preconditions would be imposed upon the recognition of the government in Skopje.

When I was at school and the Fraser government announced multiculturalism, it was presented in a completely different fashion&mdash;a fashion which sought to embrace rather than to divide.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Peacock said he does not accept the Government's claim that all three of the conditions for recognition laid down by Prime Minister Keating on 3 March 1992 have been met. He said that Government has effectively broken the Prime Minister's undertaking not to proceed to recognition until basic outstanding questions are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's first condition was that "the use of the word "Macedonia" be settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the use of the word "Macedonia" is by no means settled. Mr Peacock noted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, had reiterated on 18 January that Greece would not accept the inclusion of "Macedonia" or any derivative in the "neighbouring state's name".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Formal diplomatic use of this name by Australia could cause further tension with Greece, Mr Peacock said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the issue of quality assurance in universities. Last week the Wilson committee reported on quality assurances across Australia's 37 universities. Tonight I want to discuss the inadequacies of this process. Quality assurance was set up by this government, I believe, as a cover to the measures that it has undertaken since the 1987 Dawkinisation of universities and the very rapid expansion of universities without the adequate provision of resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Year after year we hear about the number of students that were turned away; we hear about universities bursting at the seams; we hear about overcrowded lectures; we hear about inadequate or insufficient tutorials; and we hear about libraries that have insufficient resources. The government's answer was to set up a quality assurance mechanism where it would distribute $76 million to the winners of the universities with the best quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government set out in this process to assess the teaching, research, community service, quality management processes, planning and international links of the universities. That sounds fine on the surface, but this whole process is conceptually flawed basically for two reasons. One is that the measures of management that the government set up would not stand up to the test of any competent piece of academic research because they were not reliable or valid. In the end, each university was asked to submit its own portfolio&mdash;to prove its excellence. Teams of people went around universities for one-day visits. Imagine trying to assess the ANU on one day! But that is what the government did&mdash;and it had different teams doing it. How can one set of criteria developed by one university be compared with that developed by another? The whole process was flawed from the start in the way it was devised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the process being devised was also flawed, because the government is giving money to universities that show excellence. One would have thought that if out of our 37 universities one group demonstrates excellence and another group is not quite up to scratch, the money should be given to those universities so they can come up to scratch, particularly the newer universities in this country. But the government has set up a process which is biased towards the older, larger and better endowed universities&mdash;and which very seriously damages the newer universities. The rich universities get richer and the poorer universities get poorer. What an amazing thing for a Labor government to be doing. But it has done it. Let us hear some comments from some of the senior academics on this process. Professor Brian Smith, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Money had gone to those who least needed it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . process flawed because it had looked at outcomes without comparing them to the base from which each university was starting.</PARA>
<PARA>So, again, the whole research process of quality assurance is completely flawed. It also seems that the distribution of money has been influenced by geographic factors. The universities that got into the top bracket are the Australian National University, which is in the ACT; the University of New South Wales, which is in New South Wales; the University of Melbourne, which is in Victoria; Adelaide University, which is in South Australia; the University of Western Australia, which is in Western Australia; and the University of Queensland, which is in Queensland. Do honourable senators note anything about that?

They stated that universities are already the most accountable and publicly scrutinised organisations in Australia; the current approach should be evaluated and reformulated before the next round begins; they need safeguards like full publication of rationale for decisions and training of assessors; the terms of reference need to be clear and consistent from beginning to end, unlike this year's; and there was too much changing of the rules with focus moving from excellence of outcomes to quality assurance processes. </PARA>

That example shows the absurd nature of this process. I call on the Department of Employment, Education and Training to scrap this stupid system and to let universities get on with what they do best&mdash;which is not paper work, but teaching and research. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Senate that Mr Evans has been nothing other than entirely opportunistic in this situation. Just three months ago he was elected to a four-year term in the state parliament and at that time he gave a commitment that he would see out that term. In fact, at a public meeting that was held at a school in the Elizabeth electorate during the last state election campaign Mr Evans was asked that very question by a constituent. He made a definite commitment to stay as the member for Elizabeth until the next state election four years hence. In particular, he replied to that question that was asked of him, `I will stay until the next election'; a firm commitment that Mr Evans would serve out his four-year term as a member of the state parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet when the opportunity has come for him to transfer to the federal parliament&mdash;because the Labor Party has been decimated at the state level and he does not see a future for himself at the state level&mdash;he has jumped ship, notwithstanding that commitment, and is now seeking election to the federal parliament as the Labor candidate for Bonython. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did he make a commitment to the people of Elizabeth that he would serve out a four-year term for them but he also made a commitment to another member of the Labor Party that he would support that person for the seat of Bonython when it became available. He was again heard to say to this person in relation to the candidacy for Bonython, `Don't worry about it; I will hand it to you on a plate in six months'. Not only has he broken a commitment to the people of Elizabeth by jumping ship and seeking to enter the federal parliament; he has broken a commitment he made to one of his own Labor Party people that he would support that person as the candidate for Bonython. Where else have we seen greater opportunism?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal seat of Bonython has long been regarded as a safe Labor seat&mdash;as has Elizabeth&mdash;and indeed the voting figures show this. But the people of Bonython are simply being taken for granted, simply being treated as playthings, for the convenience of the Labor Party, and in particular for the convenience of Mr Martyn Evans, who is seeking to use the people of Bonython&mdash;the people that live in the suburbs of Elizabeth and Salisbury and those other areas that make up the seat of Bonython&mdash;to further his own career. He has no real consideration for those people. He has no consideration for the commitment that he made to them only three months ago that he would serve out his term in state parliament. Those people are simply being used now as cannon fodder to promote his career in federal parliament, where he obviously believes he has some personal future which he does not see available to him in the state parliament now that Labor has no chance of being in government there for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people of Bonython ought to be aware of this intention. It is the sort of thing they ought to take into account when they very carefully consider their vote at the by-election this coming Saturday. They have for too long been taken for granted in what has been a safe Labor seat. The only way that this Labor government&mdash;the Labor Party and people like Martyn Evans&mdash;will take notice of them is if they stand up and vote for the Liberal candidate, Andy Markwell, on Saturday and reduce this seat to a marginal seat. Then they might get some attention&mdash;the sort of attention that seats like Adelaide and Hindmarsh got before the last federal election in the sports rorts affair, when hundreds of thousands of dollars were allocated to those seats and virtually nothing was given to Bonython. I simply ask the people of Bonython to consider the way in which they are being used in this by-election, to not succumb to that, and to vote Liberal on Saturday. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to address tonight the serious issue of superannuation, a matter which I have monitored for some time, and in particular certain superannuation funds in Queensland. The new Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 provides the legislative framework for prudential supervision of the superannuation industry. It is designed to increase the prudential control and protection of superannuation funds and strengthen the security of superannuation savings. An important aspect of these prudential controls is disclosure of information about individual funds. It is information disclosure, or more precisely the lack of information disclosure, under existing and proposed regulation that is the issue I wish to address.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding super</EMPHASIS>, the committee acknowledges the importance of information disclosure in prudential supervision. It suggests that, while the information disclosure requirements under OSSA have improved, information disclosure could be further improved by increasing the amount of information publicly available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the current OSSA regulations, trustees are required to disclose financial and other information to their members and beneficiaries but have no obligation to disclose any information to third parties, with the exception of regulatory bodies. While the ISC is permitted to publish statistical information relating to superannuation funds, it is expressly prohibited from identifying individual funds and disclosing information about those funds. Thus under OSSA, information about individual funds is not publicly available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its first report, the Senate committee suggests that greater investor protection and public awareness of superannuation will be facilitated by requiring disclosure of funds' investment strategies and financial statements to the public at large. Such disclosure would enable analyses by industry experts, the financial community and the media. The committee therefore recommended that the ISC create and maintain a database so that financial press and industry experts could report independently on superannuation funds with arms-length members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's response to recommendation 4.13 is to accept it with modification. The response indicates that access to information could be achieved by extending accessibility to the public access database already being developed by the ISC in the context of the superannuation guarantee arrangements. Such accessibility is, however, qualified by the statement that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the provision of detailed information as recommended by the Committee may need to be restricted to large funds on the basis of efficiency and cost.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very serious problem. The intention to restrict public access to information relating to large funds would work directly against the very reason for the committee recommending public disclosure, which was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">evidence presented to the Committee indicates that problems are more likely to arise in small funds.</PARA>
<PARA>It may be expected that the reason for the tendency of small funds to have more problems is that they have a lower public profile and that their members have limited expertise and resources to assess the performance of their fund. Large funds are more likely to already be under public scrutiny and their members and members' representatives are more likely to have more resources and greater access to expert superannuation advice. It is therefore important that the information be available without restriction, provided that information about individual fund members is not disclosed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The puzzling question is: how does the government propose to give effect to this recommendation, with or without modification, when the SIS act specifically precludes the ISC from disclosing any information which will individually identify a superannuation fund? That is, section 348 of the SIS act is basically the same as section 19 of OSSA in that the ISC is prohibited from publishing any statistical information which would identify an individual superannuation fund and disclose information about it. The SIS act is clearly restrictive and inadequate by excluding third parties from accessing information about individual superannuation funds via the ISC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government acknowledges that increased scrutiny of funds is an important safeguard for members. During the public information seminars on the proposed SIS bills held last year, the former Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Mr Gary Johns, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Greater member participation means wider scrutiny of a fund's operations, consistent with the notion that the greater the number of watchful eyes, the smaller the risk of undetected fraud or negligence.</PARA>
<PARA>While Mr Johns was referring to the SIS bills' requirements for equal representation on the funds' board of trustees, the idea that wider scrutiny equates with greater member protection means that, with public disclosure of information, even more eyes are watching, including expert eyes, thus significantly strengthening the safeguards of members' assets against negligent loss or fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Disclosure to the public at large will go a long way towards enhancing prudential control of superannuation funds which will, in turn, benefit members in at least three ways. Firstly, although industry, financial experts and the media cannot possibly scrutinise the operation of every fund, analyses of the performance of samples of funds by various industry groupings will provide members of all funds with some benchmarks against which to evaluate the performance of their own fund and assess how successful or otherwise their fund has been in comparison with industry standards. In the absence of publication of funds' financial information, no such comparisons are possible. Secondly, if fund trustees know that the financial statements and other information about the operation of their funds are open to public scrutiny, they have an added incentive to ensure that the fund is operating efficiently and effectively. Improved efficiency flows on as a cost saving to members. Thirdly, the knowledge that they are under public scrutiny will also provide trustees with a disincentive to neglect their fiduciary duties or act dishonestly to the detriment of fund members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An argument against additional disclosure is the associated cost. However, the evidence presented to the Senate committee clearly indicates that there is a need for wider disclosure, and the benefits that members will derive from such disclosure will outweigh the costs. The requirement for public disclosure of information may also help to overcome the reluctance of some fund trustees to disclose information to members under existing rules; that is, both under OSSA regulations and the forthcoming SIS regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A case in point is the current situation with former members of the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund. The Senate select committee held an inquiry into the QPOASF and presented its findings in the committee's 8th annual report in August 1993. The inquiry centred around the extraordinary payments made in early 1987 to Messrs Martindale&mdash;who was also a trustee at that time&mdash;Daly, Rutherford and Buchanan and Ms Kinder. Given that these extraordinary payments were contrary to the terms of the fund's trust deed, the committee found that the trustees had possibly breached trust laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towers Perrin, who were engaged by the QPOA to investigate the extraordinary withdrawals, reported that the fund had suffered a detriment of $34,304 due to the extraordinary withdrawals. To overcome this detriment, one of the sponsoring employers, the QPOA, has made a payment to a special fund to make good the shortfall. Although the committee's inquiry was hindered by the inability of the QPOASF, National Mutual, the funds' administrator or relevant Queensland authorities to produce the original documents which authorised the extraordinary payments, it is clear that the payments were outside the terms of the trust deed and the funds suffered a detriment as a result. The committee also found that fund members had insufficient notice or knowledge of the funds, accounts and trustees' decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of the inquiry has no doubt raised questions in the minds of past and present members of the fund about their entitlements and benefits, including such questions as: were my superannuation benefits affected by the detriment, and, if so, how; am I entitled to my portion of the additional funds contributed by the QPOA? These are important questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Difficulties experienced by some former QPOASF members in their attempts to get answers to questions demonstrates the inadequacy of the disclosure rules governing superannuation funds in the past and present under OSSA regulations and possibly in the future under the new SIS regime. One individual who was a member of this fund from 1985 to 1990 was concerned whether the benefits paid to him were correct and whether he had any further entitlement. Under the provisions of OSSA regulation 17(1)(i), he requested the present trustees and National Mutual&mdash;the fund administrator&mdash;to provide him with copies of any actuary reports, auditor reports, financial statements and ISC documents relating to the fund for the relevant years and details of any surpluses that were distributed to him during his period of fund membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The individual first wrote to the QPOASF trustees and then National Mutual in June 1993. National Mutual responded by stating that it could not release the information without the authorisation of the trustees. The QPOASF trustees' response was that they were seeking guidance from the ISC. So it went round in circles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In September 1993, having had no further response, the individual again wrote to the fund trustees advising that he would lodge a complaint with the ISC if the requested information were not received within a few weeks. The trustees' response was that they were still waiting for advice from the ISC. The member lodged a complaint with the ISC in November 1993. Two weeks later, the ISC wrote to the member advising that it had written to the fund seeking its help in obtaining copies of the member's yearly statements&mdash;no reference to the information which he had requested. Honourable senators would probably not be surprised if I told them that the member is still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This continued stonewalling by the fund's trustees leaves the individual in an invidious position with nowhere to go. The ISC seems powerless to help. Can we be confident that the sanctions against trustees encompassed in the new legislation will prevent recurrence of such blatant disregard of members' rights?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another former member wrote to the same fund requesting that, in light of the detriment suffered by the fund in 1987 and the additional contributions by the QPOA to make up the shortfall, the benefits of all former members be re-examined to ensure that the distribution be made fairly and equitably to all past and present members. The QPOA passed the request to National Mutual and its response stated that, in accordance with the Towers Perrin findings, the detriment arising from the 1987 extraordinary payments was suffered by members who had participated in the 1991 surplus distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As that individual ceased to be a member in 1989, supposedly he was not affected. However, National Mutual does not attempt to explain why it is the members who participated in the 1991 surplus distribution who suffered the detriment and not the members who participated in the 1988 distribution. It seems logical that, if a detriment has occurred because of extraordinary payments out of the fund in 1987, this detriment would affect the very next distribution made by the fund, which was in 1988. In a letter of 27 May 1993 from National Mutual to the committee, Mr Peter Grace states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Reserve Accumulation was distributed in accordance with the trust deed following the annual review of the Fund in 1988 and under the terms of the Deed was to be reviewed again within three years i.e. following the 1991 annual review.</PARA>
<PARA>So if there was a detriment at the time of the 1991 distribution, did that detriment also not exist at the time of the 1988 distribution? Or has the detriment skipped one distribution to appear in the next by some actuarial sleight of hand? Perhaps the information from National Mutual is incorrect and there was no distribution in 1988. It is quite a puzzle indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that these two individuals are experiencing raise a number of questions which need answers. Unfortunately, the QPOASF trustees and their advisers appear unwilling to provide answers or the information that the members need to help them answer the questions for themselves. The only way that these former members have any hope of satisfying themselves that they have not been financially disadvantaged is to obtain copies of the fund's financial statements, actuarial reports and other relevant documentation and seek professional assistance in unravelling what has transpired in the administration of the fund between 1987 and 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time that they were members of the fund they were entitled to have access to that information under the disclosure rules of the OSSA regulations. When they were members, however, they had no inkling of what had occurred in 1987 and thus had no cause to seek out the information. Several years later they now suspect that they have been financially disadvantaged but are unable to gain access to information to which they clearly have a legal and moral right. So we can see the problem which is faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These circumstances give rise to a fundamental question that the government needs to address. Are the information disclosure rules under the forthcoming SIS regulations adequate to ensure that individuals who have a legitimate interest in the operation of a superannuation fund have access to such information? It is suggested that the easiest and most cost-effective way of preventing a repeat of the saga I  have  described  is  to  accept  the</PARA>
<PARA>Senate select committee's recommendations without modification and publish information about all arms-length superannuation funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I indicate that I will be sending a copy of this speech to Mr Pooley, the ISC Commissioner, requesting that he instruct his officers preparing the SIS regulations to take account of the points that I have made, especially the need for former fund members to have access to fund documents prepared during the currency of their membership. I will be closely scrutinising the regulations, which I understand will be tabled in the Senate during the next few months. If they do not come up to scratch, I will not rule out moving that they be referred to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice provided by the Civil Aviation Authority:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It is assumed that the honourable senator's question is directed at the application for the extension of the Permissible Unserviceability for the inoperative autopilot of VH-NDU. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has advised that Permissible Unserviceabilities are approved under Civil Aviation Regulation 37 and do not require a concession application. The CAA is not aware of any other concession application around this time. The request was made on Monarch Aviation Group letterhead dated 14 May 1993 and was signed by Mr R W McLean. A copy of the request is attached.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Assuming the honourable senator is referring to the application for the extension of the Permissible Unserviceability, a further Permissible Unserviceability for the inoperative autopilot on aircraft VH-NDU was issued on 14 May 1993. That approval merely gave approval to continuing to operate that aircraft with an `Inoperative Autopilot'. That approval did not authorise or otherwise permit the deactivation of `associated equipment', nor did it authorise operation of VH-NDU with any items of equipment, including the autopilot, being removed from the aircraft. If approval to operate with deactivated `associated equipment' was required by Monarch, a separate application for a Permissible Unserviceability in those cases would have to have been made. No such application was made and no such approval was granted. If Monarch had wished to operate with equipment removed, they would have had to apply pursuant to Civil Aviation Regulation 42U for approval by the Authority and be authorised pursuant to Civil Aviation Regulation 35 to operate with that equipment removed. No such application was made to the Authority and no such approval was granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (a) Investigation by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) revealed that the main standby inverter had been removed from the incident aircraft for fitment to another aircraft. This occurred at the end of a shift and the maintenance crew did not document the action nor give a formal handover to the oncoming shift to ensure that a replacement standby inverter was fitted. The lack of the inverter was not detected during flight crew pre-flight checks in Sydney, but was detected  during those checks prior to departure from Los Angeles. Safety deficiencies concerning both the shift handover procedures and flight deck checklist procedures have been identified and safety recommendations made to rectify them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) (b) An Eastern Airlines Dash 8 aircraft (VH-TQO) departed Tamworth for Sydney on 10 November 1993. Engineering at Tamworth had performed maintenance on the landing gear overnight. Immediately after take-off, the `weight on wheels' caution light illuminated in the aircraft, and later, during the flight, the ground spoilers (or lift dumpers) deployed when the throttles were retarded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Investigation in Sydney found that the `weight on wheels' switches were out of adjustment. It appears that the switches had not been adjusted after landing gear torque links were changed the previous night.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ground spoiler incident involved the failure of a Licensed Aircraft Maintenance Engineer (LAME) to follow the Dash 8 Maintenance Procedures. Hence, the `weight on wheels' sensors were not adjusted after the links were changed. This in turn caused the aircraft to sense ground mode when in the air, so that when the throttles were retarded the ground spoilers extended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The CAA has advised that some officers within the Directorate of Aviation Safety Regulation (DASR) have expressed the view that it would be more appropriate for the safety regulatory function to be separated out from the Authority. The CAA has made it clear that the primary function of the Directorate is the regulation of aviation safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) There have been no changes to the training requirements for Aircraft Maintenance Engineers (AMEs) in the past five years. However, prior to 1988, AMEs were required to complete a Schedule of Experience (SOE) which was specified by the then Department. In 1988, the Civil Aviation Orders were amended to permit operators of high capacity Regular Public Transport (RPT) aircraft to produce their own SOEs for their LAMEs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These SOEs were subject to approval by the CAA. Early in 1993, the CAA reviewed this system and, as a result of that review, it was decided to re-introduce the requirement for AMEs employed by high capacity RPT operators to complete SOEs published by the CAA. The new CAA SOE was made available to the industry in early November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those AMEs employed in general aviation have always been required to complete a CAA published SOE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Around 10,000 accidents and incidents were reported in the three year period from 1991 to November 1993. Therefore, it was not considered practical to provide a description of each occurrence, even for those considered as serious. However, BASI's data on accidents and incidents are presented in a manner that provides information on the relative seriousness of occurrences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the BASI's process of selective investigation, all occurrences are classified into one of five categories. Each category indicates the level of effort which is put into the investigation and </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">thereby inadvertently indicates the seriousness of each occurrence. For example, a Category 1 occurrence would be an accident involving a major passenger aircraft killing all onboard (this type of occurrence would be a full International Civil Aviation Organisation team investigation given the highest priority). An accident involving a regional airline with multiple fatalities would be a Category 2 investigation. A Category 5 occurrence is one that has such little safety value that all BASI does is register the fact that it was reported.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this basis BASI would consider Category 1, 2 and 3 occurrences as being serious and Category 4 and 5 occurrences as being not very serious.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The furniture catalogue was produced by Purchasing Australia to assist Commonwealth agencies and other users to select items available under the Commonwealth's common use contract arrangements. It promotes these items and complements the Buyers' Guides which provide detailed information to customers about the individual arrangements. Many recipients of the catalogue have said that it has been an asset.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The furniture advertised in the catalogue is representative of the range of furniture offered to Purchasing Australia's customers through twenty five common use contract arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The catalogues with a reference price list were sent free of charge to those Commonwealth customers who are the major purchasers of furniture. Suppliers whose products are displayed in the catalogue also received a copy of the catalogue without the reference price list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As I advised the honourable Senator in answer to part 1 of his question, the furniture catalogue is a promotional tool which assists buyers in selecting furniture items to meet their requirements. When buyers select the furniture item(s) that are required from the catalogue, they then refer to the Buyers' Guide mentioned in the catalogue for details about placing orders with that particular supplier. Orders are placed under the relevant common use arrangement and not against the catalogue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The furniture catalogue covers twenty five (25) Buyers' Guides. The items are predominantly made in Australia. In the Audit Report No 7, 1992-93, Efficiency Audit, "Saving Time and Money with Common Use Contracts" the Australian National Audit Office estimated that, by value, 80% of goods and services provided through the common use arrangements were sourced in Australia and New Zealand. The report indicated that the furniture common use arrangements have a high local content.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) No revenue is raised from the catalogues themselves. The Furniture Catalogue was issued during May and June 1993. Turnover from furniture common use arrangements in 1992-93 exceeded $45m. For 1993-94, turnover to the start of February 1994 has exceeded $25m which is on target to meet or exceed the 1992-93 turnover. The Furniture Catalogue is one of the factors contributing to this good result.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) 2002 furniture catalogues were printed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been advised that the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) AUSLIG is establishing a GPS base station in Hobart as part of a national network of Global Positioning System (GPS) stations. This network serves two primary functions&mdash;geodetic and integrity monitoring and will be used by Commonwealth agencies such as the Civil Aviation Authority, Defence and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority. These primary functions are part of AUSLIG's national and international public interest activities. They provide significant benefits to the Australian community including more efficient and accurate surveying and mapping, and information for crustal motion and greenhouse monitoring. As a secondary function, AUSLIG can provide positioning data for GPS users. The AUSLIG station will provide a more accurate service and a broader capability to state government, local government and industry users in Tasmania than is available from other base station operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Because the geodetic and integrity monitoring services are being undertaken as part of AUSLIG's public interest obligations, there was no need for a market survey with regard to these services and none was undertaken. While a market survey for the positioning services has not been conducted yet, AUSLIG generally prefers to operate with private sector partners for the provision of such services. Accordingly, AUSLIG and the Tasmanian Department of Environment Land and Planning have held preliminary discussions with a private base station operator in northern Tasmania with a view to establishing an agreement for joint distribution of GPS positioning information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Existing local base stations could not support AUSLIG's geodetic and integrity monitoring requirements. Local base stations operate on single frequency whereas dual frequency operation is essential for the level of accuracy required for those functions. The location of existing base stations and the inability to allow dedicated access to equipment were other reasons for their unsuitability. As mentioned above, AUSLIG would prefer to work with other base station operators for the provision of positioning data.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) AUSLIG's commercial operations are subject to the same costs as private industry when servicing the private sector.</PARA>

These services are not being provided by private base station operators.</PARA>
