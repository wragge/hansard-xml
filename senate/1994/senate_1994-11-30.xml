<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1994 is to update the Qantas Sale Act 1992 in the light of recent developments. The bill also will amend the Air Navigation Act for reasons I will come to later. Four divisions in the first part of the bill affect the Qantas Sale Act. The second part of the bill deals with the amendments to the Air Navigation Act. The amendments relevant to the Qantas Sale Act include, firstly, those necessary to Qantas being able to participate in the new stock exchange clearing house electronic subregister system, which is known by the acronym CHESS; secondly, technical amendments regarding name changes in certain employee rehabilitation and compensations acts; thirdly, an amendment to clear up an inconsistency with the definition of long service leave to make it consistent with other asset sales; and, fourthly, an extension of the sunset clause provisions of the act regarding the sale from 30 June 1995 to 31 August 1995.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the bill relates to amendments to the Air Navigation Act. These are intended to clarify the Qantas position regarding foreign shareholdings in Australian airlines. The Air Navigation Act 1920 imposes controls over foreign shareholdings in Australian international airlines but, because Qantas is subject to its own controls under the Qantas Sale Act, it was never intended that the Air Navigation Act measures should also apply to Qantas. However, as the wording of the Air Navigation Act is ambiguous it will be amended by this bill to confirm that these measures do not apply to Qantas. The Qantas Sale Act includes specific provisions for Qantas&mdash;namely, a limit of 35 per cent on the level of foreign ownership. These amendments ensure that the Air Navigation Act does not apply to Qantas in this regard. According to the government there are no financial implications from this bill, but I will comment on that in more detail a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very fact that the government has introduced another amendment bill in relation to the Qantas Sale Act indicates just how incompetent the government has been in its handling of its asset sales, in particular its handling of the sale of Qantas. We reasonably expected that the government would no longer control Qantas by the end of this year, yet the government still has a 75 per cent stake. According to the amendments in this bill which extend the sunset provision, the government could still have that 75 per cent interest by July or August of next year. Given the way this whole issue has been bungled to date, who knows that the government will not come back to us between now and August next year with another amendment proposal to blow out the sunset clause still further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government first announced the intention to sell part or all of the public ownership in Australia's then two publicly owned airlines, Qantas and Australian Airlines, way back in November 1990&mdash;more than four years ago. Responses by potential buyers were sought and lodged by July 1991, after the issuing of an expensive sales brochure and after a great deal of work had been done by the asset sales task force within the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the February 1992 so-called One Nation statement, the government announced further changes to its aviation policy, including the proposed trans-Tasman single aviation market reneged on by transport minister Brereton earlier this month, just days before it was scheduled to commence operation. This is another example of sheer blind incompetence on the part of this government and, in particular, the Minister for Transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1992 the government announced the sale of Australian Airlines to Qantas and, at the same time, announced its intention to sell the full 100 per cent of the newly emerged Qantas Airlines. At that stage, the government was claiming it would complete the 49 per cent trade sale by the end of 1992 and float off the remaining 51 per cent in the first half of 1993. But, in March 1993, British Airways bought 25 per cent of Qantas for $667 million. In July 1993 the then Minister for Finance announced the postponement of the sale of the remaining 75 per cent until a future date&mdash;supposedly, at that stage, within the next 12 months, when the government had hoped to get a better deal on the float and therefore more money into its coffers to help it balance its books, which are, of course, lamentably and dangerously out of balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent pronouncements from the current Minister for Finance (Mr Beazley) have been for a public float of the remaining 75 per cent by March 1995. But this bill now indicates that even that timing may be too early and it may not be until after the middle of next year, which very significantly means that it is possible it will not be finalised until after the close of the 1994-95 financial year. If Qantas is sold in, say, July of next year, then this process will have taken 4 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only assets sale that comes close to matching that disgraceful record of incompetence up to date is the sale of the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation, which has been going on since the 1989-90 budget&mdash;for over five years. Even the debacle of the sale of ANL&mdash;the minister has described this as worthless anyway and his comments and actions have greatly damaged the sale value of ANL&mdash;which has been a long, ongoing, tortuous affair, still has not, as yet, matched the record of the Qantas sale in terms of time taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of the sale of the float of the remaining 75 per cent is potentially very significant. There are some important aspects which the government needs to explain when we are perhaps in committee on the bill or perhaps when the minister is summing up on the second reading, because the figures are very interesting to contemplate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already we have seen 25 per cent of the airline sold into foreign ownership&mdash;British Airways. That leaves the 75 per cent float still to come. However, under the Qantas Sale Act only 35 per cent of the total shares can be held by foreigners. So that means there is only 10 per cent to go of the remaining float that could be sold to foreign shareholders. A total of 75 per cent is to be sold; therefore, 65 per cent of it&mdash;about six-sevenths of what is still to be floated&mdash;has to go to Australian shareholders otherwise the foreign ownership provisions in the Qantas Sale Act will be breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The float is said to be worth around $2.2 billion, $2.3 billion or perhaps $2.4 billion&mdash;nobody really knows. But on the basis of the sale of the first 25 per cent for $667 million, a figure of the order of $2 billion to $2.4 billion or thereabouts probably is in the government's mind. Because of the ownership provisions of that amount only $300 million or thereabouts can go to overseas shareholders. That is, of the float of the remaining 75 per cent almost $2 billion has to go to local ownership. That will impose not insignificant strains on the capital markets here in Australia&mdash;the share market, the capital raising market in Australia&mdash;in the next year. It will be very interesting indeed to see whether the government can handle it and, more particularly, whether the markets can handle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pass no judgment on that, of course, but I do draw it to the attention of the Senate because it is a point that has not really had much attention up to date. It does raise the question in the 35 per cent foreign ownership of why we are making such a special arrangement in relation to Qantas. Most other sales of assets in Australia to foreigners are subject to the normal policy provisions of the Foreign Investment Review Board. Qantas is being treated separately from that. The government has not really explained why that is the case. Perhaps the government may have some comments on that in its summing up in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I draw to the attention of the Senate is the impact on the government's 1994-95 budget if the sale is not consummated by the end of June 1995 as seems to be contemplated now by the statements of the Treasurer (Mr Willis) and the Minister for Finance and indeed by the fact that the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill is extending the existing sunset clause out from 30 June 1995 by two months into the 1995-96 financial year through to 31 August 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is already in all sorts of trouble with its existing 1994-95 budget. To meet even the huge budget deficit contemplated in this year's budget the government is relying very heavily on proceeds from asset sales and of those the overwhelming sale that it is looking for is the Qantas sale. The government is looking to bring in more than $2 billion to help its revenue situation this financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this bill the government is sending a none too subtle signal to the markets that that $2 billion plus may not be forthcoming this financial year. The implications of that for the government's already extraordinarily lax fiscal policy are significant indeed. Let me just say in relation to that&mdash;and I pick up the notice of motion given this morning by my colleague Senator Watson&mdash;that the call by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last night for the government to increase taxes&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kernot" NAMEID="XW4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government may have to find revenue somehow, but it went to the last election on the fraudulent promise that it was going to cut taxes. Do honourable senators remember the l-a-w law tax cuts? That is what the government went to the last election on. It lied its way into government on a program and a policy of reducing taxation. If the government were to respond to the call by the Governor of the Reserve Bank last night to increase taxes, it would perpetuate the fraud in relation to economic management and the lies of this government in the area of economic policy. Given that Senator Kernot has interjected so vigorously during my speech, I will be interested to hear her comments on the need for tax increases when she makes her contribution to this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get back to the specifics of the bill and the wider considerations of it in relation to micro-economic reform, because the privatisation program is a very important part of micro-economic reform. Over the last 10 years the handling of the micro-economic reform agenda by the Keating and Hawke governments has been an absolute disaster. Privatisation and increased competition in key markets have been ineptly handled or virtually ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and its officials in the estimates committee last night were talking about the underpinning of the government's policy being competition policy. What an absolute nonsense that is when we try to match the reality of the government's actions with its rhetoric. The government has gone cold on micro-economic reform in a way that will be very damaging and very dangerous for the economy as we struggle to become an internationally competitive economy. International competitiveness is going to be the thing that will make or break the living standards of this country in the years ahead. The government has gone absolutely cold on most of the changes that are necessary in the structure of our nation and our economy, including in particular privatisation, if we are going to be in a position to capitalise on the enormous opportunities that we have from being in this part of the region, the fastest growing region of the world. The opportunities are there for us if we grab them, but we will not grab them if we do not take the necessary micro-economic reform measures that the government is backing away from at a great rate of knots. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be placing a high priority on reducing its ownership of trading corporations and using the major proceeds from those sales to reduce its bloated public debt. As this government has had asset sales, it has not tried to reduce the public debt&mdash;indeed, the public debt has blown out during the period of asset sales. In the last three or four years alone the government's public borrowings have gone from $30 billion of public debt to almost $100 billion this year&mdash;the absolute opposite of what is required if we are going to have a responsible approach to economic and, in particular, fiscal policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With near record low national savings and a Commonwealth budget deficit still over $10 billion, whilst we are well into the recovery phase, there is no excuse for allowing public debt to continue rising as it is. This is clearly a tired, incompetent government devoid of interest or ideas and, more particularly, devoid of any thought on how we are going to get the basic economic structures of this country, certainly Commonwealth government policies, into place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill would never have been necessary if the government had handled the sale of Qantas with even a modicum of administrative ability. It was not just the way it approached the actual sale, but those who were involved in the sale were frustrated at every stage by continual changes in the government's transport policy, particularly in the area of aviation. It was going to sell Australian, then it was not going to sell Australian. It was going to put Australian with Qantas, then it was not going to put Australian with Qantas. On and on it went, to the great frustration of all those concerned and, in particular, to the great frustration of the process of the sale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the coalition does support the sale of Qantas. We have for over five years and we will therefore be supporting this bill in the hope that it will be the last before Qantas is actually off the government's books. As I have said, given the difficulty that the government could have in finding sufficient local take-up of the float, the government may well have to return to the parliament to seek further change to the Qantas Sale Act in relation to foreign shareholdings. That, however, may not be politically possible for the government until after the next Labor Party national conference due for 1996. By that time, I expect that Labor's attitude to this legislation will be purely academic, because by then the electorate will have thrown this incompetent, tired, arrogant government out on its ear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the Senate this morning is the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1994 which will provide the legislative and administrative framework for the sale of the remaining 75 per cent of the Commonwealth's equity in Qantas Airways Ltd. I rise briefly on this occasion to draw to the attention of the people of Australia the complete mismanagement of this whole program of the sale of Qantas Airways.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The privatisation of Qantas, I remind the Senate, has been surrounded by bungled attempts by the government on four distinct fronts. Firstly, the initial 25 per cent of the equity sale to British Airways effectively put the control of Qantas into foreign ownership, a situation that gave British Airways a very strategic position in the long term on the great kangaroo route to London on which Qantas built its fame and fortune. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government's mishandling of the third runway has added considerably to the airline's&mdash;indeed, to all airlines'&mdash;operating costs into New South Wales. These costs fall most heavily on the government's airline, soon to be privatised, Qantas. Thirdly, the proceeds of the first sale were not used to retire debt but to finance new investment projects, an accounting disaster if ever there was one. I therefore use this opportunity to call on the government to use the sale proceeds from the remaining 75 per cent of its equity to retire debt. These proceeds are estimated to be about $2 billion, and that money must be used as part of a deficit reduction strategy and not used to finance current or recurrent expenditure. The government is breaking all the rules of prudent financial management in the handling of its privatisation program, and this Qantas sale is but another sorry saga in that chapter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth reason for my concern about these bungled attempts by this government at the sale of Qantas is that the parliament currently has before it a further bill which will have a significant impact on employee share ownerships in Australia. This is designed to take share issues by a company to its own employees out of the income tax arena and put them fairly and squarely in the fringe benefits tax collecting mechanism. For most companies of the size of Qantas this will add about $1 million to the costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This action will have a very destabilising impact on the sale of Qantas for two reasons. Firstly, it will increase the effective cost to the Commonwealth of the sale of Qantas. Or, looking at it from another perspective, it will certainly impact on the sale price of Qantas if the new employers, as a result of the agreement to sell part of the shares to the employees, have to pay a significantly high cost in terms of fringe benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, this bungled attempt by the government in relation to the employee share ownership scheme is a human relations disaster. We all know that, as a way of improving productivity, issuing shares in the organisation where an employee works is a very good human relations exercise. It improves morale, it increases productivity and it gives a sense of belonging to something worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that this is a human relations disaster for Qantas. Qantas has a great number of employees&mdash;it is one of the largest employers in Australia&mdash;and the government's action in relation to the employee share acquisition scheme, which effectively adds in the order of $1 million to its costs, was taken without realising the consequences of it on the effective sale and the proceeds arising from the sale of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to call on the government to do two things: to ensure that it uses the proceeds of the 75 per cent of the equity in Qantas to retire debt rather than to use it for current expenditure; and to amend in a significant way the employee share acquisition scheme so that non-tax avoiding, human relations improving, traditional employee share ownership schemes are not taxed under the fringe benefits tax regime but come firmly within the ambit of the ordinary income taxing provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wishes to separate those schemes that it believes are clones&mdash;schemes that are tax deferrals, schemes that are rorts&mdash;let it so legislate. But the traditional, the honest, the important things that are improving human relations and giving people a sense of purpose and well being, let them continue. I call upon the government to amendment the employee share ownership scheme to enable a better sale for Qantas to take place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating the Qantas Sale Amendment Bill 1994. I have said on previous occasions that my interest in Qantas is not just as a senator but as a previous employee of Qantas. I want to talk today about the level of ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that there is no way that any government can actually control who buys shares on the Australian stock market. We can impose limits on what is floated on the stock exchange but people can buy shares through agents and, as we know, there are many companies which have been taken over by certain interests, interests that become substantial, and by stealth people can purchase shares on the Australian stock exchange whenever they like. There is no way of knowing from the annual reports of many corporations and companies who owns individual shares and what their nationality is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also nonsense to suggest what seems to be the general feeling that overseas investment will automatically make Qantas more competitive. I think what is certain is that increasing the level of overseas investment in Qantas over time will mean that the interests of Australians in having a national airline will become less and less important to the total run of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are things about an airline that are not entirely market oriented. On the top of the list is safety. There are certain things you do not see when you get on board an airline. While we can see the fittings, how clean the aircraft is, the uniforms of the staff and so on, we cannot see the level of safety. That includes things like crewing time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who can forget what happened after Pan Am was bought? The flight crews had their hours increased in order to cut costs and Pan Am started falling out of the air. We, like lemmings, are marching towards privatisation for no real reason except that we are marching towards privatisation. We do not want one of the world's safest airlines, because of the push to increase profits on what used to be our national airline, to decrease its safety margins. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Safety also includes such things as training; not just training of the people who fly the aircraft but other staff and crew&mdash;and other training as well. It includes the level and quality of service and maintenance. Those things which are most important about an airline are the things we cannot see. They are the things shareholders do not see. They do not see them in the books as profit; but they are probably the most important things about an airline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard arguments in this chamber about the Civil Aviation Authority, even from the opposition, that when it is asked to cut costs and maintain safety at the same time, there is going to be a conflict of interest. How can that be any different for Qantas? It will be forced into the same situation if the level of ownership and control is taken away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been recognised that there is also the national interest and national security to consider in relation to an airline. It may be necessary to have people ferried out of a country or from parts of Australia. What guarantees do we have as we go along this path that if we have a huge national disaster we will have the use of this airline to perform those functions?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worry I have is that recent statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) have indicated that we have made certain changes in investment rules with regard to the Uruguay Round of GATT which will be enforced by the World Trade Organisation. There are further steps that will take place with regard to access to investment in Australia and Australian corporations via APEC. That is a few years down the track. What guarantees does the government give us? Because of this process of leaping like lemmings from GATT to APEC, in a few short years we will have absolutely no way of making sure of the level of control or ownership of Qantas that is in Australian hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am issuing these plaintive warnings that we are going down a line that nobody has really checked out. We know there is no real evidence that privatising necessarily creates a better service. I am warning that those things about an airline which are the most important are the ones that do not show up on the balance sheets. I am also asking what it will take before we realise that pushing in this direction for the sake of compensating for a decreasing tax base through government decisions to give to the rich and take from the poor means that in the end that we all may be the losers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Qantas Sale Amendment Bill contains a range of technical amendments. The one we would single out as the most significant is the extension by a further two months to 31 August 1995 for the completion of the Qantas sale. The Australian Democrats are not confident that the sale will even be finished by that date, because the Australian share market is probably getting very close to its limit in terms of big floats&mdash;and, certainly, those of the size of the $2 billion Qantas float.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already had the sale of the Commonwealth Bank, the GIO and Woolworths. There is a lot of competition around at the state and territory level: we have Jeff Kennett in Victoria selling off everything that moves and most things that do not, and John Fahey in New South Wales with his own program. And, of course, our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) intends raising $8 billion in privatisation over the life of this government's deficit reduction strategy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts has raised concern about an important policy consideration in this debate. The Democrats share this concern and have raised it in the past. What are the strategic implications in an excessive level of foreign ownership of Qantas, if that were to become a reality? The government has announced it will accept up to 35 per cent foreign ownership, with 25 per cent being in any one person's hands. As we already know with the Fairfax takeover, when we look at control&mdash;not ownership, but the issue of control&mdash;that is more than enough for the company to be effectively foreign controlled. At least in this case&mdash;and Senator Short raised the question, but I approve of it&mdash;the 35 per cent level is prescribed in legislation. As distinct from media policy, offers to Prime Ministers to provide balanced flights, as distinct from balanced coverage, are not likely to result in the percentages being raised after some private conversation behind closed doors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we debated this before, the Democrats moved to reduce the foreign owned percentage to 20 per cent, with a 10 per cent maximum for any one player. Both the Labor and Liberal parties combined to defeat this amendment because, in terms of public policy, they do not really care who owns&mdash;but, more importantly, who controls&mdash;our former publicly owned assets. I think we should care. We may have lost the privatisation debate&mdash;although I think we will be revisiting it&mdash;but at least we ought to care about the consequences of privatisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I quote from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 26 November, where Peter Ellingsen reports from London that `Britain's passion for privatisation has produced no payoff for the public'. I quote two long paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the 10th anniversary of the first privatisation, the public is starting to realise not only that the sell-offs have made millionaires of those who run former state enterprises, but have cost consumers something like $9 billion. Britain's 20 million consumers have seen $200 million of their money handed to the new privateers on a plate. Yet, in a lesson with implications for Australia, these privatised firms have failed to provide promised benefits to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the minister responsible for more privatisations than any other, the now retired Lord Parkinson, admits the auction of public businesses has not gone as well as planned. ". . . the net result is that shareholders have done rather better out of it, and customers have done rather less well," he says. In many ways, the push for privatisation has been a false horizon, with the government massively underestimating the value of assets for sale, and the public finding they had to pay the cost of lucrative windfalls for managers and shareholders.</PARA>
<PARA>Shades of that are happening in Australia now. Will we in Australia take another 10 years to learn that lesson? I think it is a legitimate debate to have: whether governments should own airlines and, if they should, to what extent. But the whole issue of privatisation and who ends up paying for it in the long term has not been adequately discussed in this country because the opposition and the government agree on embracing this aspect of economic rationalist theory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill today contains the same percentage on foreign ownership as the earlier bill. The other interesting issue raised I think by this bill is the issue of the fate of the employee share plans that Qantas offered. It will be almost impossible for the new owners of Qantas to provide any reasonable level of employee share ownership for their employees, without incurring a massive fringe benefits tax bill under the government's promised taxation of employees' shares. The government has been very quiet on the impact of the budget on employee ownership of Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have been pursuing this issue, as the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) knows. We want to see the employee ownership of Qantas maximised, but under proposed tax laws that could create a massive future tax bill for future owners of Qantas. The point is it will reduce the selling price. So when we are talking about what the public gets out of these sales, we can also raise the question: what will the employees in the long run get out of this sale?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard Senator Short raise today's economic hot spot: the comments of the Governor of the Reserve Bank. I heard Mr Costello on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> this morning. I heard the usual opposition mantra: `Cut the deficit, cut services, cut costs. We can do it. The government is being slack.' I just want to point out a couple of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, it is very hard to cut the deficit at the same time as the opposition proposes a sales tax rebate on exports worth $1 billion; doubling overseas aid from 0.34 to 0.7 per cent, worth $1.4 billion; tax deductibility of private health insurance worth $1.4 billion to $2.9 billion; tax breaks on savings worth upwards of $500 million; income splitting or increased home child-care allowances, worth $1.5 billion to $8 billion; regional infrastructure spending of $1 billion to $3 billion; and capital gains tax relief of up to $300 million. The opposition will have to find an awful lot of efficiency saving somewhere to pay for those increases and to bring about its public policy position of cutting the deficit through cutting expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, what I lament more than anything is what the opposition's hypocrisy does to public debate in this country. Every time somebody tries to have a mature discussion about the failure of economic policy in this country or anybody raises the possibility of somehow raising revenue differently, what we see is the opposition popping its little head up again saying, `Ah, the government's going to raise taxes.' There are a couple of fundamental facts of life about this country at the moment after a decade of opposition and government failure to address the way in which we are living beyond our means. Ross Gittins in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> points this out most eloquently. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Almost everyone&mdash;from business economists to radio talk-back hosts to blue-singleted workers in pubs&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and to this list I would add the opposition&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">persists in the belief that spending cuts are a Magic Pudding. The Government can cut and come again merely by eliminating "waste and extravagance" and without harming anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a mountainous alibi built on a grain of truth. It will always be true that there's inefficiency somewhere in the system which, if only you could get at it, would yield relatively painless savings. But it's equally true that eliminating inefficiency will yield only a fraction of the savings we'd need to put the Federal Budget back onto a self-funding basis.</PARA>
<PARA>To him and to me his conclusion is inescapable that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . until taxpayers are prepared to pay for the benefits and services we expect the Government to provide, we'll go on living beyond our means, racking up public and foreign debt&mdash;and leaving the bill for our children.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the unpalatable fact of the moment. While ever we have this stupid and counterproductive inability and lack of resolve to discuss what I see is a very serious problem in Australia, then we will continue to neglect our obligation to leave this country in a better state to our children. Back to Qantas, privatisation is one part of the reason that we are living beyond our means. We should revisit the privatisation debate in this country, and it is something that I intend to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And the opposition has indicated that it will support the bill. So the bill will be carried. I want to begin by thanking the speakers in this debate for their contributions. I want to deal with a couple of issues that have been raised which I think require some comment from me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Perhaps the first starting point should be the argument that the sale of Qantas should be used to reduce the deficit or to fund some other program of expenditure. I understand that this argument was put earlier in the debate today. We have estimated sale proceeds for the Qantas sale, and those estimates are reflected in the government's budget estimates. Thus they form part of the deficit and debt reduction program. Honourable senators will know that the government has a medium-term deficit reduction program. My point is that, in raising the issue of direct application to the deficit or some other public works idea, the proceeds of this sale when realised will be factored into the budget settings as they stand. Thus they are playing their part in contributing to the deficit and the debt reduction strategy program of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the arguments that have been canvassed more recently in this debate are worthy of greater comment. The first concerns the Qantas employee ownership plan, to which a number of senators have referred in their remarks. It is as a principle that the government is attracted to. Employees of enterprises ideally should be offered the opportunity to take a shareholding in those enterprises. In the case of a sale of a significant authority such as Qantas, it is our view that an employee share ownership plan is a desirable feature of that sale. We have said so, and we support the concept. The details of how such a proposal might be applied are not yet settled. They are under consideration and are in a process of development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of views have been put as to what should be the situation, but nothing at this point has been decided other than that the principle has merit and should be applied and that a scheme should be developed to enable employees to take a shareholding in the company for which they work. A number of proposals have been put ranging from, as I understand it, the ACTU on behalf of unions and employees, suggesting 10 per cent of the share offer to a range of other proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue put in this debate refers to a debate about tax on employee share ownership schemes as a measure in the last budget. I think I heard Senator Kernot refer a moment ago to the fact that we have debated that in this chamber usually in the format of question time rather than as an extended debate on economic issues. It has been a question and answer repartee-style debate rather than a more developed, considered debate. Nonetheless, it is a debate we have had in this chamber, and one on which I think it is fair to say in all honesty we do not agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of share ownership schemes operating for employees in Australia are used as tax avoidance devices, as vehicles for tax avoidance. The government's position is that there is a need for regulation in this area to make the schemes genuinely what their titles imply they are&mdash;employee share ownership schemes. While that title, as socially acceptable as it is, is used to describe tax avoidance, the tax avoiders escape public scrutiny because they seem to be doing something that is pure and of high or lofty motive. The government's concern is that employee share ownership schemes should not apply just to senior executives in companies. They should be available to all employees in companies; they should be egalitarian schemes in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some companies offer employee share ownership schemes not in their company but in other companies as a way of getting around the tax laws. We ought not be seeing this sort of tax rorting. This is an area of tax avoidance that ought to be directly addressed. The government has done that in the budget. Because of some concerns about the way in which the application of those rules might fall, we are further reviewing the application of those rules so that the avoidance issue on tax is overcome. The objective of the government's view is to deal with the avoiders and protect genuine schemes. The Qantas share employee ownership scheme is being worked up in the full knowledge of what the government's view is. It is consistent with the view that it will be a genuine scheme, that it is not a tax avoidance vehicle and that it offers employees the right to hold shares in the authority. As such, my understanding is that it would not attract any level of tax in the way in which honourable senators have suggested it might were it a scheme of the sort that we are seeking to regulate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of honourable senators have made suggestions about extra cost. However, in view of the explanation I have made and particularly in view of the point that the Qantas scheme, when it is developed and unveiled, will be revealed as a genuine scheme which is consistent with the government's objectives, it should not come under the rules that have been applied to deal with fraudulent schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area of comment in this debate has focused on the issue of foreign ownership. Qantas is a national asset. It is the flag carrier for Australia. The kangaroo on the red tail of Qantas is a symbol of national pride. One looks at this airline from the point of view of encouraging Australian ownership of it. Some senators have raised this issue in this debate, and some clarification about the government's position is perhaps necessary, given the nature of the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point is to go back to what the original legislation provides. Part 3 of the act enshrines national interest safeguards. It enshrines those safeguards because they are intended to maintain the basic Australian character of Qantas as well as to ensure that Qantas' operating rights under Australia's various bilateral air service agreements and arrangements with other countries are not threatened. Thus, the act requires that Qantas's articles of association must contain provisions which will ensure that: Qantas's main operations base and headquarters remain in Australia; the name of Qantas is preserved for the company's scheduled international passenger services; the company be incorporated in Australia; at least two-thirds of the board of the company of Qantas be Australian citizens; the chairman of the board of Qantas be an Australian citizen; and, while foreign ownership can be accepted, foreign ownership in total should not exceed 35 per cent of total ownership and no single foreign interest can hold more than 25 per cent of that foreign ownership. Qantas's articles are also required to provide directors with wide powers to act, including to deny share registration or to force disposal of shares held by foreigners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those provisions are in the act as it stands. They are not subject to this amendment bill. The purposes for them being enshrined in law in Australia now is to address this issue of foreign ownership, the national identity of the airline and the need to maintain a majority Australian ownership of the airline, consistent with the objectives of realising a good market price in the float. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by again thanking honourable senators for their contribution to this debate. I look forward to the speedy passage of this legislation. The amendments are not insignificant but are along the track we have trodden in the past and are an extension of that track in order to provide the right climate for the people of Australia to realise a best case outcome for the sale of a national asset while maintaining a majority Australian ownership of that asset. I commend the legislation to the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the summing-up comments by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) at the second reading stage. Since they were concluding comments, I was precluded from responding on that particular occasion. But he raised a number of interesting and, unfortunately, incorrect statements. I asked the minister how his government intends to exempt future share issues to employees under the employee share ownership scheme which is currently before the parliament from the proposed provisions of the fringe benefits tax regime. The Senate deserves an answer other than a statement that the government has not yet worked it out, because we have a very onerous bill before this parliament which imposes a fringe benefits tax on genuine employee share ownership schemes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says that this is a genuine share ownership scheme but, for some reason, the government intends to exclude the Qantas scheme from the onerous provisions of the fringe benefits tax regime. Does the government, for example, intend to introduce a special bill which will put aside the Qantas employee share ownership scheme from the provisions of the Fringe Benefits Tax Act? Is the minister effectively foreshadowing amendments to the Fringe Benefits Tax Act to exclude the traditional share ownership schemes&mdash;schemes that are genuine, schemes that are traditional, schemes that are not new generation clones, schemes that are designed to assist in a good public relations exercise?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the minister&mdash;and he does not seem to have realised this fact&mdash;that if we impose a fringe benefits tax regime this will effectively reduce the future sale proceeds of Qantas Airlines, because the new owners will have to pay the fringe benefits tax. I pointed out to the minister&mdash;I think he was absent when I made my presentation&mdash;that most companies of the size of Qantas will be up for something like $1 million in fringe benefits tax. This is too high a cost for most companies to pay. So, effectively, the company bosses have gone on strike against the actions of this government because of the cost of doing the right thing and issuing shares to their employees in their own company or their parent company. How many share issues have we seen since the minister's announcement of this proposal? Not one significant scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">True, in one or two instances particular shares have been given to an exclusive group of directors. However, the government's trade union mates&mdash;the very people whom the government has betrayed under this legislation&mdash;have been working towards ensuring there is an opportunity for greater employee participation through share ownership. By this very act, under the new employee share ownership scheme, the government is denying them that opportunity. I ask the government to think again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am heartened by the minister's comment that they are to be excluded but before we pass this legislation, or certainly before we pass the employee fringe benefits tax legislation which is designed to bring these genuine schemes within this new net, would the minister tell us how the government will exclude the genuine schemes&mdash;please, do not just exclude Qantas. A lot of other companies out there&mdash;BHP, Coca-Cola Amatil, Lend Lease&mdash;have genuine schemes with people wanting to issue shares but precluded from doing so because of the high cost barrier that the government has put in front of them.</PARA>

I would certainly like to see more than 10 per cent of the shares go to employees; but it will be well nigh impossible unless they pay a very high cost penalty in the form of a fringe benefits tax. The government is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It is causing tremendous pain and grief for all those genuine schemes just because there are one or two out there on the fringe who are not doing the right thing.

Firstly, Senator Watson started the questioning process: I am pleased to see Senator Watson in the chamber. I enjoyed his company until about 2 o'clock this morning when we were both working on the economics estimates committee. It is nice to see Senator Watson back so fit and well this morning and in fine fettle. Having complimented Senator Watson, let me deal with his argument, because while I do have some considerable respect and regard for Senator Watson's knowledge in these areas, on this occasion his argument does not hold up, if I may say so with the greatest of respect to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not said in the first instance that 10 per cent of the Qantas sale should be reserved for employee share ownership schemes. It is not the important point, I know. I referred to one body, the ACTU, asking for that to occur. But the amount and the manner in which an employee share ownership scheme will be applied is not resolved at this point. When it is, that is one of those issues that will be addressed. But the burden of Senator Watson's intervention appeared to me to be how this will impact on the price and whether we will be legislating to exempt Qantas from the legislation that is on its way to this chamber on employee share ownership schemes overall. I do not expect it is going to have an impact on the price of Qantas. </PARA>

If it were at odds with it, fell outside the legislation, was regulated and then required a fringe benefits tax, that would be one thing, but if it fell within the legislation as a proper employee share ownership scheme within the meaning of our intention, it would not attract the fringe benefits tax that Senator Watson referred to and have that depressant effect on the price.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, it has to be attractive to the employees. The ability of employees to buy shares is motivated by a series of factors. Certainly one of the attractions is the pride of employees of having a chunk of the company for which they work and the satisfaction of having ownership in part of their employer. Nonetheless, it also has to be attractive from other points of view, too. But this is what the minds of those who are working up the scheme is bent to doing and it would be inappropriate, I think, to have a debate on the legislation on the bill on employee share ownership schemes in the forum of this Qantas bill. Let us have that debate when that bill comes forward, rather than have the debate twice over but on a measure which is not the measure of Senator Watson's concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

That is the reason why we have the extension of the sunset clause. If that does happen, there is that hole in the budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Maybe the minister might like to answer the two questions together as he did on the previous occasion. Will the minister not concede that when the employees share ownership was first discussed by the board of Qantas, it was working on the premise of the previous legislation which did not impose a fringe benefits tax on share ownership schemes. Will the minister not concede that in all share ownership schemes the shares are effectively issued at something of a discount? Therefore, under fringe benefits tax legislation currently before the parliament such a discount would attract a fringe benefits tax type liability. Otherwise, there would be no incentive for the employees to take up the quantity of shares that the trade union movement, the board of Qantas, the management of Qantas or even the government would like.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some adjustment in the sale price or else there will be a strike not only by the employers around Australia not to issue new employees share benefit schemes but by the employees themselves in terms of their refusal to take up an entitlement if that discount is not sufficiently attractive.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason why I cannot answer Senator Watson's question in specific terms, and therefore dissipate his concern, is that the proposal itself is not finalised. When it is, then we will see how it satisfies all the conditions I have suggested it is intended to satisfy are met. But the scheme is being developed now with a clear understanding that it should fall within the meaning of the government legislation and not, as I am advised, attract a significant cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us allow the people who are doing this to do their job and come back with the final proposition and see how they meet it. There are challenges inherent in it but the art of good government is to recognise challenges and to overcome them. To Senator Short, quite a bit can be said about the sunset date. Division 4 of part 1 of the schedule to the amending bill alters the automatic sunset date, to which Senator Short has referred, prescribed by subsection 2(6) of the Qantas Sale Act. This section currently provides that any elements of the sale act which are not commenced by 30 June 1995 are repealed. The amendment bill alters the sunset date to 31 August 1995, as he has said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change to the legislative sunset date is to provide administrative flexibility in relation to the public offer of shares in Qantas, scheduled for the period April-May 1995, particularly if the government decides to hold the float following the May 1995 budget. In that event, the public offer could be launched in mid-May 1995 with the objective of completion several days prior to 30 June 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that occurred, it may not be administratively possible to arrange before 30 June for the proclamation of provisions of the sale act, which are intended to commence following the offer, in which case&mdash;and I think this is the point&mdash;the float could be completed but the legislative framework for ensuring the transition to a fully publicly owned body would not exist and would need to be re-enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An extension of the two months in the sunset date is proposed in order to cover all eventualities should there be unforeseen developments which affect the timing of the commencement of the float. This raises the possibility that, if there is a delay of a week or two in the float timetable, the sale proceeds may not be received in the year 1994-95, as provided for in the budget estimates. However, it is the government's unequivocal intention that this objective be achieved. Therefore, planning for the float is proceeding on the basis of finalisation before 30 June 1995.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited Sale Bill 1994 has as its main purpose the establishment of a legislative framework for the sale of the government owned AeroSpace Technologies of Australia, commonly known as ASTA. Another purpose of the bill is to ensure that specified ASTA employees who continue to work for the company after it is sold will retain accrued public employment entitlements and obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides that, from the date of sale, ASTA is treated as a private sector company and is not subject to Commonwealth legislation which currently applies to ASTA because of its status as a Commonwealth owned entity. Finally, the bill also has as its purpose the recognition and continuation of certain rights and obligations which arose before the sale, particularly in relation to corruption offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTA is an important organisation. It was formed in 1986 out of the old Government Aircraft Factories and has around 700 staff. It is involved in civil and defence aircraft component design and manufacture. It is also involved in aircraft maintenance and it runs the Avalon airport in Victoria, near Geelong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government took a decision in December 1993, I think it was, to sell ASTA. There has been some controversy in recent weeks as to whether the contents of the cabinet minute that reflected the cabinet decision&mdash;and the minute has become public in recent weeks&mdash;in terms of the assessment of the corporation are in line with the fairly bullish press statement that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) released after the cabinet had taken its decision. When the Minister for Defence&mdash;ASTA falls within the defence portfolio&mdash;announced that the corporation was going to be up for sale, he painted a reasonably rosy picture, whereas the cabinet minute had certainly been much more sanguine about the matter and about the prospects for the company. There was some debate on that in the other place and I do not propose to traverse it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the company is now trading profitably. I do not know what the government has as an estimated value of the company on sale. According to a recent report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, it is expected to be worth around $50 million. Press reports indicate&mdash;and I think the minister has tended to support this, but I cannot confirm it&mdash;that the government, following calls for expressions of interest in advertisements that appeared a few weeks ago, has two interested buyers in ASTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition supports the bill. We have no problems at all with the proposed privatisation of ASTA. Indeed, at the last election it was on our list for privatisation. As the pioneers of promoting privatisation in Australia, we fully endorse moves to sell government commercial trading assets. We see no need for the taxpayer to continue to own such a company. As I said, we will be supporting this bill to facilitate the sale. In doing so, I repeat that it is an important operation. I hope that privatisation and the benefits that can flow from that will lead to benefits for the company and that we will see it go from strength to strength in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited Sale Bill 1994 provides for the sale of AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Limited, which the government has been trying to orchestrate for some time to minimise its losses. That it has not been able to sell ASTA previously in profitable years says more about the current state of defence industries today than it says about ASTA in particular. The last profit and loss statement of ASTA shows a loss of $490,882. This has occurred while the company has been thoroughly propped up by government subsidies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since its inception the government has made total payments to ASTA in the order of $161.5 million. This is openly admitted in the 1993-94 budget statements. There have also been two loans on top of this: one for $8 million for a short-term working advance, which was repaid; and the other for $3 million under Loan Council borrowing arrangements. I suspect that the clauses at the end of this bill relating to an exemption for the new owners of ASTA from borrowing levies  will apply to outstanding loans such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill importantly looks after the superannuation and benefits of those 700 workers at ASTA. But what the bill does not explain is why the taxpayer had to prop up this unprofitable organisation for little return. When it comes to the sale of ASTA, what does the government expect to receive? Who has expressed an interest in buying? Are they foreign or domestic buyers? Will the money we receive from the sale cover the $161.5 million injected into ASTA throughout its lifetime?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should consider any ultimate losses Australia may receive from selling off ASTA. The government will be tempted to sell ASTA at a low price to get it off the government's hands and stop the steady flow of subsidies into the annual budgets of ASTA. The government will be unsure whether there will be any potential buyers for ASTA with its export dependence and reliance on the contracts of the small and inefficient defence industry of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation that ASTA is faced with is one experienced across the board by defence industry in Australia. This is the post-Cold War reality of the lower global demand for arms exports and equipment. In fact, since 1987, when the value of the world trade in major conventional weapons was at a height of $45 trillion, there has been a decline of about 60 per cent to a world value in 1992 of $18 trillion. The market that has sustained this trend is the Asia-Pacific, which is currently experiencing an arms build-up that every man and his dog are trying to capitalise on, including us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987 many multinational defence companies have reconstructed, severely cut back or gone under. In the current scenario, however, these multinationals are concentrating on the Asia-Pacific market, a market not renowned for its human rights, democracy, civil or political rights; we are also concentrating on that market. We combine our arms export push into Asia with the rhetoric of `building regional security'. We cannot, however, compete with global arms companies which have the advantages of economies of scale and global market. This trend is only going to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must, therefore, re-examine the destabilising effect our arms exports have on the countries around us. I note that, although we do not have a perceived large external threat, we have exported millions of dollars worth of arms to our neighbouring governments with little regard for their use against innocent civilians in internal oppressions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As leaked in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper on Monday, it seems that one of our major defence white paper initiatives will be to consider a highly expensive military spy satellite to monitor troop, arms and equipment movements in the Asia-Pacific. Are we not existing in a parody which ultimately results in a diversion of billions of dollars away from needy people and worthwhile projects to be spent on defence?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASTA has in its own way been a success. In its beginnings it started off with a $30 million loss and has worked its way up to a half a million dollar loss in 1992-93. It has minimised its losses only by moving out of defence contracts and into commercial aircraft maintenance. Many companies, like ADI, are in a similar position in having to diversify into commercial areas to stay viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note from the annual reports that both ADI and ASTA have gone into land speculation. ADI wants to develop a 4,000 strong housing development, and ASTA has 4,000 acres at Avalon on which it is hoping to make money. Any sale of ASTA would, I expect, fully value that land and the sale price. It is worrying that ADI is involved in land speculation. One would think the lessons had been learned from the $250 million loss in Western Australia due to WA Inc. Might I remind the Senate that ADI has received $366 million and so far has escaped accountability with that payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, I hope that the burden of ASTA on the taxpayer can be resolved in the near future by its sale. I hope, however, that this will entail selling ASTA for a higher price than our total investment through years of subsidies. I hope that it will mean a higher domestic ownership; that we can keep aircraft standards under our wings and the entrepreneurial threat of bogus parts out; and that ASTA will further diversify in order to survive and move away from its unprofitable reliance on defence contracts. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, on our way to that determination, we look at issues like the public interest, the existence of monopoly or community service obligations and whether the taxpayer is, in the long-term, better off holding the asset in revenue than disposing of it. We do not look simply at privatisation as a form of short-term revenue raising, as I think the government and the opposition often do. It is worth noting that, over the life of the deficit reduction program&mdash;as I said in my previous speech on the sale of Qantas&mdash;the government is planning $8 billion worth of asset sales or about two-thirds of the difference between the deficit at the beginning and that at the end of the program. </PARA>

While the buildings and hangars are nearly fully utilised, we believe that the airport itself is still underutilised. I presume that selling ASTA means selling the airport as well.

I think it is important that Australia retains a viable aerospace manufacturer, but it is not as important that the manufacturer be publicly owned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ASTA is sold, as I expect it will be, I think it would be very important for any contract of sale to include some key national interest considerations. The prospective buyer should, first, guarantee that strategically important facilities remain in Australia; second, ensure that as much as possible the research and development work is undertaken in Australia; third, commit ASTA to pursuing an export strategy; fourth, commit itself to further investment and expansion of ASTA; fifth, if the sale includes Avalon airport, the prospective buyer should undertake to develop an access regime which will better utilise the facility and complement regional development strategies in the Geelong area; and, sixth, it should ensure that as much as possible the employment of existing employees is continued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the parliamentary secretary addressed some of these issues in his second reading speech, but the word in parliament is, try standing between the Department of Finance and a prospective pot of gold as part of an important deficit reduction strategy and see how long parliamentary assurances in second reading speeches stand up. Perhaps the minister could repeat some of these reassurances today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> These conditions make this sale a little different from other sales. In the case of the sale of the Moomba gas pipeline, the Senate originally set conditions on the sale, including the satisfaction of an access regime and proper compensation for the extinguishment of contractual rights which the government had to meet. The Democrats were considering an amendment to test the Senate's resolve to do that again. We thought it was appropriate to set conditions that the sale not be effected until satisfactory assurances were received from any would-be purchaser. I have not done that, but I have certainly placed on the public record our view of the obligations that prospective purchasers should be beholden to in Australia's interests. This is an important asset that is being sold; Australia should get something out of it in the long term. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Ltd Sale Bill 1994. AeroSpace Technologies of Australia, commonly referred to as ASTA, is proposed for sale. As I understand the debate that has been put forward by three senators in this chamber representing the coalition, the Greens and the Democrats, no-one is gainsaying the proposition that ASTA ought to be sold. What we have is a congruence of view that that, in these circumstances, is acceptable. I use the word `acceptable' not to describe the government's view but the chamber's view. However, a concern was articulated by Senator Kernot on behalf of the Australian Democrats about the nature and Australian content of such a sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The first point is that I agree with the consensus that has come forth about the sale of ASTA. The question raised by Senator Kernot, and I think referred to by other speakers, is an important question. When one looks at ASTA, the first and most obvious consideration is the strategic importance of having on our shores an aviation company able to do the defence work that ASTA can do and able to keep in Australia valuable technology and expertise for the aviation industry. Thomson Radar CSF, the French conglomerate which won the contract for re-equipping Australian airports for radar from the CAA, has decided to locate in Australia a regional headquarters for the whole of the Asia-Pacific area. This is a European company choosing Australia as the base for its radar production for the whole of the Asia-Pacific region, the fastest growing aviation area in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why this major international company chose Australia was the high quality of Australian expertise, technical expertise in particular, in this field. It is important to note that we place a premium on the fact that ASTA embodies, along with a couple of other companies in Australia, expertise in the aviation area, both for defence and civil aviation, that a developed country should want to have&mdash;not at any price but on a commercial and viable basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, in terms of the sale of ASTA one of the presiding principles is finding a buyer which can add to the viability of the company, which can bring some new investment to the company, which can generate this company into a more export orientated company and a company able to capture some of the large opportunities in the Asia-Pacific market, and which can add to our base of technological understanding in this field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's preference is for majority Australian ownership of ASTA. But, as I have said, the government is seeking a buyer, or perhaps buyers, able to demonstrate a capacity to provide synergistic benefits to ASTA; that is, to support the government's commitment to the ongoing development of a strong export oriented domestic aerospace industry and to maintain employment in that industry. I think that is as far as I can go in answering the questions Senator Kernot has raised. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ANL Guarantee Bill 1994 gives the Treasurer or his delegated officer on behalf of the Commonwealth government the authority to guarantee payments under loan agreements entered into by ANL Ltd, which was formerly called the Australian National Line. Let me say at the outset that the coalition opposes this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial impact of this bill appears to be uncertain and open-ended. I will pursue the financial obligations under this bill further in the committee stage. Indeed, I will not say too much during this second reading debate because there are many specific issues I would like to take up and they would be better dealt with in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I draw the attention of honourable senators to the debate on this bill in the other house and, in particular, to the contributions by my colleagues the shadow minister for transport, Mr Sharp, and the shadow minister for privatisation, Mr Moore, which have outlined in some considerable detail the really very sad and sorry saga of this whole ANL exercise and the duplicitous way in which the government and, in particular, in more recent months, the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, have handled this whole issue. The way the government has handled this whole question of ANL is absolutely disgraceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor government's stated need for this bill is that it will `help ANL to continue to trade in an orderly fashion, especially during the restructuring process in which the company is currently involved'. That is not a justification for this bill. Rather, it is simply a quite pathetic excuse for the bill. The real reason for this bill is that it  provides a taxpayer guarantee to any loans so that the Maritime Union of Australia and its partners&mdash;and any partners it can coax together into the ANL deal in terms of shareholding&mdash;will be able to take over ANL free of any financial risk. All the risk will be left with the Australian taxpayer. That is what this bill means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a deal that is for the unions&mdash;a tremendous deal for the unions, which have been absolutely bought off in this whole exercise. What a deal it is for the Australian taxpayer, left with an open-ended commitment of potential financial liability so that the government can do a deal with its mates in the unions, particularly the Maritime Union of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is only part of the disastrous underhand deal that the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did to buy off the Maritime Union of Australia. The Maritime Union of Australia held this nation to ransom by shutting down our wharves for a week. In return&mdash;and there have been suggestions, which I have not heard refuted, that the strike was contrived and staged in the first place anyway&mdash;that union got the biggest reward imaginable from the Labor government. It got this deal that any loans to ANL would be guaranteed when the union tried to buy it. Given the way in which transport minister Brereton has handled this and the public statements he has made, he has absolutely crucified the potential value of this potentially very important asset. He got up and said that the line was not worth anything&mdash;that it was worthless. He acted in a way, either consciously or unconsciously, which had the result of greatly undermining the confidence that potential buyers could have in this line and therefore in the value of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then he dealt in the Maritime Union of Australia as an actual part-owner for when the whole thing comes together. So we might finish up with the union getting the line for a song&mdash;and bringing in its mates to share in that&mdash;because the government has, by its comments, down-valued the real value of the asset; and at the same time we have this bill which guarantees, at taxpayers' expense, the loan liabilities to the company. It is absolutely disgraceful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, but the union got an income tax exemption for its international crew members and a stop to real competition in coastal shipping. All this adds up to a federal government&mdash;I was going to say, eating out of its hands; but that would be too weak a description. The union has a federal government bowing in absolute subservience, contrary to and against the wishes and interests of the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ANL has been for sale on the market for over three years now. The government has made an absolute mess of its handling of this asset sale, as it has with many other aspects of its assets sale program. Earlier today we went through the Qantas sale debacle that has been going on now for something like four years. ANL, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and the airlines have been for sale for years. In the case of Qantas&mdash;and there is every sign that it has been happening here, although to a somewhat different degree&mdash;the government continually changes the environment in which the particular asset is operating. What the government did there in changing the policy so far as airlines were concerned was legion. We have had continual chops and changes in ANL and others as well. No wonder the asset sales process has been the debacle that it has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the ANL sale debacle has severely undermined the operations of the company. It has left a cloud over its future. According to the old board&mdash;a board that Minister Brereton summarily dismissed in August in the most outrageous, discourteous way possible&mdash;it has cost ANL dearly in business terms. As I said, the government has savaged the value of ANL, and Minister Brereton, in his recent shake-up on this matter, was on the record as saying he `could not give ANL away'. What a statement for a minister to make when his government is about to proceed to try to sell the asset as a going, viable operation. So much for the actions of this minister. He is an absolute disgrace. As a result of that, his mishandling of the ANL sale has cost taxpayers very dearly. If this bill is passed, it will continue to cost taxpayers dearly for potentially well into the future&mdash;virtually open-ended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the government has had 11 years&mdash;it is getting on for 12 years&mdash;of responsibility for transport policy and, during that period, the running of ANL. Surely that is more than enough time to provide the environment and conditions for a company to be profitable and competitive. Instead, by a deliberate process of underfunding the company, refusing to fund the company, refusing to give it the opportunity to be competitive and viable, the government has run it into the sand and left it absolutely stranded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not the way to deal with ANL. This is a nightmare of a bill so far as the implications for the Australian taxpayer are concerned.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said at the outset that the coalition will be opposing this bill. We are not opposing the bill because we oppose the sale of ANL. On the contrary, we support the sale of ANL, and we always have. It is the government that is the Johnny-come-lately relative to the coalition in terms of its preparedness to sell ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make it absolutely clear we are not opposing this bill because we are opposed to the privatisation of ANL. We support the privatisation of ANL. We are opposing this bill because it is a completely unnecessary bill. It is a bill that should never have had reason to come into this place. It has come into this place only because the government has allowed itself to be totally manipulated and dominated by the Maritime Union of Australia and other influences&mdash;one can only imagine what some of those may be&mdash;that have had a detrimental effect on the value of the asset. This bill will just compound the debacle that the government has presided over so far as the whole approach to ANL is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that we will be opposing the bill. As I foreshadowed earlier, in the committee stage of the bill I want to put several specific questions about this matter to the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of the ANL Guarantee Bill is to provide a Commonwealth guarantee of the debts of the Australian National Line. The aim is to allow the restructuring of ANL to proceed without raising the prospect of re-financing. This is obviously a measure to avoid frightening the horses&mdash;more particularly, it is a measure to avoid frightening the financiers to whom ANL is currently in debt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As everyone should know, the intended endpoint of the restructuring process is that ANL will no longer be in public ownership. The disposal options include a float, a trade sale and a de facto liquidation with a soft landing. A union led buy-out has been put on the agenda following the recent waterfront strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is well known in the chamber that the Australian Democrats challenge the theory of privatisation always. However, it is difficult to argue that the public service provided by ANL, which is hardly essential compared with those provided by such agencies as Telecom and, of course, Australia Post, is worth the drain on taxpayer funds caused by the continuing large losses. The resolution of the waterfront strike has removed any effective constituency for continued public ownership of ANL and the Democrats do not propose to prolong the debate by arguing for it here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there is room for considerable doubt as to whether ANL is salvageable to any significant degree. The Price Waterhouse/ Salomon Brothers valuation suggested that a managed trade-down&mdash;in effect, an informal liquidation backed by a Commonwealth guarantee&mdash;was the most likely outcome of the sale process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats hope that for the sake of the workers and the viability of the shipping industry ANL can continue as a going concern using Australian crews on Australian award rates. The sceptics will no doubt claim that insisting on Australian conditions increases the risk that ANL will never be viable and, indeed, cabinet last year seemed to have formed that view itself when it decided to scrap that sale requirement. It is up to the new board to set ANL on an even keel without sacrificing that important condition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand the opposition's position, it does not take issue with the government's view that it should guarantee ANL's debts. If the government did not do so, not only would the restructuring of ANL be hampered but also the credit rating of the Commonwealth would be in some considerable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the opposition departed from the government during debate in the other place was over the need for legislation. As Senator Short has confirmed today, the opposition has persuaded itself that there is no requirement for this bill, while the government begs to differ. The Democrats, for our part, are a little more persuaded by the government's arguments than by those of the coalition. The Audit Act does appear to require legislation before a guarantee can be given, so we will in fact support this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to speak long today on the ANL Guarantee Bill 1994, but I do think it is necessary to put a few comments on the record. As Senator Short has mentioned, a good deal of the problem in relation to ANL has been of the government's own making&mdash;in fact the vast majority, in my opinion. He has mentioned the capital starvation that has occurred, and there seems to be quite a lot of evidence of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been asset stripping&mdash;I suppose the kind of thing corporations did in the 1980s&mdash;which means that there is an intention to sell eventually and to make money out of what is there in the meantime, but the whole process is thereby made less viable. The context in which all of this has occurred is that of removing any real industry policy from this industry and from many other industries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that this policy of removing an industry policy or stepping back from industry policy has a lot to do with the egos of those people who have been negotiating for the new trade regime internationally. Australia is wanting to be seen to be leading the way, even though it is foolish and naive to leave our industry stranded in doing so, and not to be looking at the interests of not only the workers in those industries but also of those other industries which depend on a good standard of shipping for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have heard me on the record say why we need a decent shipping standard. If we lose our national line and our state lines we know what this might mean. We then have no standard by which to compare other shipping standards. We have already seen a higher percentage of flag of convenience carriers operating here and elsewhere. It is part of the new international deregulated trade regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know how easy it is for carriers to gain a flag of convenience registration. We know what the implications could be if we have a major oil spill, which, I certainly know from what has happened in Western Australia, we have avoided more by good luck than by good management. What will be the economic, environmental and social cost if our lack of industry policy in relation to shipping does result in a major maritime disaster? Who will pay for that? Will it be the government? Will it be the taxpayer? I suspect it will be the community and the environment, because those shipping lines which do not have a strong financial base behind them will be unable to find the money because of the way they are put together. Therefore, we are rushing blind into a situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I realise this current situation with regard to the guarantee is as a result of putting ANL between a rock and a hard place. The unions representing the shipping industry are being put into the same place. I believe it is not a satisfactory situation. Our support of this current bill is not because we think it is the best solution. It is the solution that has been worked out by bad policy and it is perhaps the best of a number of evils at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do believe it is not too late for the government to seriously look at our interests in relation to shipping; to seriously look at what we are giving away voluntarily under the service provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade; to seriously look at whether or not our negotiators in these international fora are doing the right thing by our industry, our environment and our community; and to seriously look at what the implications could be in relation to APEC of going further in some of these particular provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that some of these things were challenged by the community, once they realise that these things are not happening by accident. Industry policy which relates to environment and welfare employment is being changed by decree from on high, and our negotiators in the international fora are trying to lead the way. So the government is very culpable in just about every way we can think of in this regard. It is not good enough. We will support this legislation but feel that the government has a role to play, and ought to be doing so, as far as shipping industry policy in Australia is concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the ANL Guarantee Bill 1994. Three speakers in this chamber have contributed to the debate on the second reading. Senator Short, from the coalition, indicated that the coalition&mdash;the Liberal Party and the National Party combined&mdash;will oppose this measure. Senator Bourne from the Australian Democrats indicated that, with some reservation, the Democrats will support this measure. Senator Margetts, who has just concluded her address to the Senate, indicated that the Greens, if I might editorialise her contribution, will support this measure, although somewhat reluctantly and with considerable reservation, while calling on the government to address other aspects of trade, GATT, APEC, and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On that summary of the positions of the parties, and given that the government will support this measure, it is clear that this bill will have a second reading and may indeed pass. Senator Short has indicated that he has a number of questions to raise in the committee stage about the technical operation of the bill and issues relating to the financial guarantees. He also spoke briefly but pungently attacking this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will summarise the government's position. It is a matter of observational fact that the ANL over the years has had a rocky history. Because the maritime industry and shipping has been a difficult area, from time to time governments have had to make tough decisions about what should be done to keep the ANL service operating on an even keel. The government has injected large amounts of taxpayers' money into this shipping line in order to do just that&mdash;to keep it afloat and operating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) dismissed the board of the ANL and instituted a new board which will report on how the company can be restructured, what the options are for its future, and how it can remain viable. That new board will report at the end of February next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill arises because there is a need to guarantee the debt of the ANL in order that the board&mdash;the new board, which is looking at the restructuring and the ongoing viability of the show and at future options&mdash;has time to complete its work, free from anxiety and concern about those who are in debt for the ANL and in order to ensure a proper commercial arrangement for the ANL's creditors. This bill is a holding arrangement so that a properly constituted and capable board can bring down a report about the future of the outfit. If this bill gets knocked off, in effect it would be the vote of the Senate not to extend the opportunity to find a way out of the ANL's problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the indications of support around the chamber, this bill will not be knocked off. But the opposition, which wants to defeat this bill and which aspires to be the alternative government, obviously, as oppositions are wont to do&mdash;I make this as an observation rather than an accusation&mdash;wants to make life as difficult as possible for the government and put obstacles, confusion and argument in our way at every turn. That is democracy; that is what we expect. We bear it and get on with the job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the opposition has a wider responsibility. It has a responsibility not simply to oppose but also to say what it stands for. What would it do if it were in government? How would people judge it if it occupied the government benches and were in charge? One can only draw from its dog in the manger posture, its wanting this bill to be defeated, that it wants to `run the ANL into the sand', to quote Senator Short,  by not extending the proper commercial cover for the board, which is now bringing down a report on the ANL's future viability, for it to be able to operate and for proper consideration about the future viability of the shipping company to be made. By wanting to defeat this legislation, it wants to defeat the ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obligation is on the opposition to say what it would do. It has taken comfort in opposing and, as one would expect, making life uncomfortable for the government. But it is not saying what alternative proposals it has for the shipping line, other than some vague reference to selling it. I do not think that is a responsible position for the opposition to take. As in the past, people will continue to judge it as being incapable of governing, capable only of thinking in negative and defensive terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this stage the debate from the opposition has not extended beyond that point. I wait with interest to see the questions that will be raised by Senator Short. I acknowledge the qualifications and the reservations expressed by the other supporters of this legislation. I recognise the value of the constructive way in which they have been put forward by the other parties. The government has taken note of those. I will certainly refer them to the minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I foreshadowed in the second reading debate, I have various questions that I wish to put to the minister about the aspects of the bill. Firstly, though, I will respond to the minister's assertion that the opposition's voting against this bill was simply designed to obstruct the proper or desirable processes of the privatisation of ANL. Nothing could be further from the mark, of course.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everything we see before us today in this bill is a living example of how this government cannot properly manage a commercial enterprise. We should not have this bill today. It is simply wrong for the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) to go out and tell the world that, in his view, we could not give away ANL. It is a disgraceful thing for the minister&mdash;who is charged with the responsibility of selling an asset at the best price for the Commonwealth and, therefore, the taxpayer&mdash;to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental problem with ANL today is a problem that has accumulated for many years under this government. The problem is that this government has deliberately starved ANL of capital over nearly 12 years that the Labor government has been in office. That is why ANL has the problems that it has. It is not because of any incompetence on behalf of the board. One of the problems that the board of ANL faced right through the period of the Labor government was that every time it requested capital injections, necessary capital injections, the government was loath to provide them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that the minister ought to answer, and he put questions to me in the second reading debate, is: what would have been the case if the government had sold ANL some years ago and allowed a private sector operator to own and operate it? What would have been the saleability of ANL if the government had had half an ounce of commercial commonsense and put the necessary capital into ANL to allow it to be competitive and viable? What would have been the case if those things had happened? If they had happened, I would put a few dollars on the fact that ANL would be in a considerably better position and much more secure than it currently is today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I dare say that ANL, which has been traditionally starved by the government of capital over the last 10 or 12 years, would have found itself in a much better financial position for sale some years ago, with its private sector operator taking over a company that was much better placed for the competitive world of today. So the minister should not go on with this cant to me about the coalition being obstructive in terms of the sale of ANL. We have had the sale of ANL on our agenda for years now. We also had the proper financing and funding of ANL on our agenda, had we had the opportunity in government to have done so. I wanted to put that on the record. Many other things are on the record in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> in the other chamber on this debate, to which I refer honourable senators because there was a good debate, and very significant contributions were made by both Mr Sharp and Mr Moore. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister an initial question. It is a fact that the government owns all the shares in ANL. The government is the owner of ANL. Given that that is the case, I ask the minister: why is this bill necessary at all? Why do we need legislation in order to guarantee the debts of the company when the 100 per cent owner of that company is the Commonwealth?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short has put a question to me, which I will answer. I would like to make one or two remarks about the editorialising in which he engaged before he came to his question. Perhaps the record needs to be straightened up on some of the points that he put. The first point he made&mdash;and I took this down&mdash;was, `How can the government manage a commercial enterprise?' He asked that with respect to the ANL&mdash;that we have somehow bungled managing a commercial enterprise. ANL is not a statutory authority. We are not managing it in that sense.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator Short</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I didn't say you were managing it; I said `enable it to be managed commercially'.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, we are the sole shareholder in ANL. ANL is a company incorporated under the Corporations Act, and therefore we have had in place a commercial board. A commercial board has been able to manage the company but with considerable difficulty over a number of years, up until the point at which we felt it necessary, as the shareholder, to dismiss that board and replace it with a tougher, leaner board able to look at long-term prospects for its viability and to restructure the company. That is a responsible exercise of authority by the government. It is not a question of running the show into the ground; it is a question of looking at how the long-term commercial viability of the outfit can be guaranteed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February we will receive a report on those options from the current board. This bill is about ensuring that the company survives until then and beyond then so that those options can be properly considered and implemented. The main theme of the allegations made by Senator Short by way of interjection and during debate&mdash;I took these words down; I hope I am accurately quoting him&mdash;is that we have `starved the ANL of capital'. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Short" NAMEID="DJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short acknowledges that; I thank him for doing so. Since 1983 we have provided capital injections to ANL. We came to power in 1983. When a government provides capital injections, it takes taxpayers' money and puts it into a commercial operation. Obviously, the viability of that commercial operation is a major consideration in whether one is wasting taxpayers' money or using it constructively to keep an operation going which will be viable. We have put $160 million of taxpayers' money into ANL since 1983.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short's confirmed assertion is that we have starved ANL of capital. I do not think that $160 million of taxpayers' money is starving an operation of capital. It is in fact supporting it with capital. Since we have to husband the taxpayers' purse with responsibility, we cannot keep doing that. We ought not keep doing that if questions of commercial viability are involved. That is why we have come to the decision that we have to call a halt to that process, look at the alternatives for restructuring the company, and look at the alternatives for its longer-term viability. We need to carry this bill to guarantee that ANL can continue to exist. We need to ensure that the $160 million of taxpayers' money has not been money up against the wall, that it will not have been wasted and that there will be some advantage to the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In five of the past seven years the company has experienced operating losses before interest and before tax. Why would we inject more funds into an outfit which is in that situation without calling a halt to the process? Even if that company now had no debts whatsoever, even if it were debt free, it would still be making a significant loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Senator Short's assertion&mdash;he has confirmed this is his assertion&mdash;that we have not supported the company and have starved it of capital, $160 million does not sound like starvation to me. But, in any case, there is a responsibility on the government to ensure that it uses its taxpayers' dollars wisely and not as a bottomless pit. The commerciality of a company and its ability to trade successfully are fundamental considerations in what we do with taxpayers' dollars. Let me move, however, to Senator Short's question which related to the present state of the company and whether it is as a result of&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The legislation is necessary&mdash;I think this is set out in the second reading speech&mdash;because of the specific requirements, as I am advised, in the Audit Act 1901. This bill will guarantee all of the debts. The bill of itself does not guarantee all of the debts. The bill authorises the guarantee of repayments of principal and interest under loan agreements. But, due to the specific restrictions imposed by section 70B of the Audit Act, other debts and liabilities do not need legislation but may be guaranteed by executive action of ministers without the need for specific legislation. According to my notes, the short answer is that, because of the requirements of the Audit Act, we require this bill in this manner. I have confirmed that with the officers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, too, have read the government's second reading speech. I do not think it answers my question. My question is a very simple one. The government owns an asset 100 per cent. The Commonwealth government is normally regarded as being a pretty safe borrower, if you like, because it always guarantees its borrowings and the borrowings of its operations. Why, in those circumstances, do we need a separate bill to guarantee the liabilities of a 100 per cent owned government enterprise?</PARA></TALK.START>

The responsibility of a shareholder to a company is the value of the shares&mdash;the limit of the shareholding. There is no guarantee beyond the shareholding in the company. That is why a guarantee in this legislation is necessary. A simple reading of the Audit Act shows that the bill is needed in order to guarantee the other debts. It might suit Senator Short or others to argue this point, but that is the advice we as the government have. What are we supposed to do?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I understand it, the question is: has the Auditor-General had a look at the guarantee and expressed any views about it? The answer to that question is that there are no guarantees at the present time. This legislation is required in order to clothe the Treasurer with the ability to issue those guarantees. If this bill is passed, we meet the requirements, as we are advised, of the Audit Act. The Treasurer is then in a position to move and issue a guarantee, and that would be what applies in those circumstances. I would need to take advice on whether or not the Auditor-General has a role on that. In answer to the specific question Senator Short has raised, there is no role for the Auditor-General at this point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my turn to make fun of this question, with the greatest respect to Senator Short. The government does not ask the Auditor-General to review its legislation. The Auditor-General has a statutory responsibility to the Crown to conduct proper audits of government departments and authorities. But we do not go to the Auditor-General with our legislation and say, `Please would you run your eyes over this and give us a clearance to enact this legislation?' As I said in my answer to Senator Short's last question, the role of the Auditor-General may arise&mdash;and I would need to take advice on whether it does or not&mdash;with respect to any guarantee that is offered by the Treasurer should this bill be passed and the Treasurer be clothed with the power to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what I am saying. If Senator Short had stopped trying to find holes in the argument and actually listened to the argument, he would have heard me say twice now that the purpose of this legislation is to give the Treasurer that power, consistent with our advice on the need to do so under the Audit Act, and then the Treasurer presumably would move to exercise that power; and at some point there may be a role for the Auditor-General, I do not know. But we have not submitted&mdash;and it is not appropriate that we should&mdash;this legislation to the Auditor-General for his views about it. We have other ways of forming an opinion about the legality or otherwise of this legislation. Indeed, it may well be not entirely the province of the Auditor-General to express issues on points of law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I think is worth making in this debate is the question of market confidence, and it is really an issue for the opposition to ponder. There may well be political points made by pursuing the line that the opposition is pursuing; that is a choice for the opposition. We will, of course, deal with that. But for the government too there is a need to maintain and to bolster in a positive way, where we possibly can, the confidence of the market in ANL. If one runs a big scare campaign, a `what if' campaign or a `there are strange things happening here' campaign, which seems to be what the opposition is doing&mdash;and the opposition ought to recognise this&mdash;that does have the potential to damage the confidence in ANL as a commercial entity in the market in which it is operating and at a time when it is struggling. I guess that is for the opposition to decide; but I think it is appropriate for me to draw it to the opposition's attention and place it on the record because it is a consideration that the government has in these circumstances. </PARA>

Since the last election there has been the largest single jump in fuel taxes on record, yet this was the election in which Senator Sherry and his colleagues went around Australia with Mr Keating and promised there would be no further tax increases.

What is the impact on the owner of that car of Mr Keating's 7c a litre rise in fuel taxes? The answer is $140 per year. This is the man who said that there would be no rises in taxes. The problem is that, despite the huge rises in fuel taxes under this government, there is every prospect that motorists&mdash;and, of course, all consumers of goods and services, and so all Australians&mdash;are going to be socked with another rise in fuel excises. All this is from the man who promised not only that he would not increase taxes but that he would bring down taxes. I put it to you that this government has a major tax problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. It was interesting that in the Senate yesterday Democrat Senator Sid Spindler was concerned about fuel prices being paid by country people. I have said this to the Democrats time and time again, and every time they get up in this chamber and pretend to show some concern about the level of fuel prices I will remind them of it. Not only did they vote enthusiastically to increase fuel prices after the last election, despite the fact that it amounted to a broken promise, but their own policies constantly talk about the need for higher fuel prices. I would point out to Senator Spindler and his colleagues that over 50 per cent of the price of fuel paid by country people and by city people in Australia is taxation collected by Mr Keating at the petrol pump.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of the Senate to a second matter, which is that, despite the fact that there has been a massive explosion in fuel taxes under the Keating government, road funding, as a share, has declined. Mr Acting Deputy President, you come from the state of Queensland, where there is a great need for more roads. You will be interested to learn that, with road funding as a percentage of fuel excise in 1982-83, some 62 per cent of the taxes raised from fuel in that year was spent on road funding. After the lean Keating years we come to 1994-95. You will also be interested to learn that the current percentage of fuel excise which is spent on road funding is 8.4 per cent. Not only have fuel taxes gone through the roof, but road funding is being cut and the states, with their narrower revenue base, are being asked to take on more of this burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth mentioning that, in my own state of Victoria, Victorians contribute about 27 per cent of Australia's fuel tax revenue and they account for some 35 per cent of Australia's commercial road travel. Despite this, only 16.5 per cent of this year's federal funding will be spent in Victoria. There has been a marked run-down of road transport infrastructure in Australia&mdash;I do not think there is any argument about that&mdash;and Victoria received only some 62 per cent of the funds necessary for maintenance of the national highway infrastructure in that state. Major road funding is not the only problem; we are also looking at further rises in fuel tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by quoting comments by Mr Tony Love, President of the Australian Automobile Association, in the annual report of the Australian Automobile Association. In the president's report, Mr Love writes about the increases in fuel excise, and he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impact of these decisions is not confined to motorists, of course. Increasing the level of taxes on road users and reducing the level of expenditure on roads inevitably leads to higher transport costs, higher prices, higher inflation and less competitive exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been argued that Australia still enjoys lower fuel taxes and prices than most other countries, but that is misleading and largely irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Among the countries which have a lower percentage of fuel tax than Australia are the US, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. In regard to actual fuel prices, those which pay more than Australia are invariably much smaller countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They do not have to contend with our vast distances and the consequent high cost of transport, which particularly disadvantages Australia's export industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The increasing tendency by governments to treat the fuel pump as a convenient and lucrative source of additional income is therefore shortsighted to say the least, although the temptation is understandable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest increases in excise, for example, together with the twice-yearly indexation of excise rates, will help boost the Government's fuel tax revenue by an estimated $1100 million, or more than 13 per cent during 1994-95 alone.</PARA>
<PARA>Would that that were the end of the story but no, it is not. I predict that, regrettably, we are going to see higher and higher fuel prices in this country, which will make Australian industry less competitive and which will harm our export potential. There is a recognition, and correct recognition, in the business community and at least in certain sections of the Public Service, that one of the major aims is to cut the input costs to business and to cut taxes on inputs. Fuel excises, of course, increase the cost of inputs to business. Therefore, they make our exports, among other things, less competitive. I conclude by saying that this is going to become a big issue again. Fuel taxes and fuel increases are back on the Keating agenda, and motorists and consumers right around Australia had better brace themselves for further tax rises. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How many has he been out to? Is he like the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and been out to maybe two or three in the last four years? The question the parliamentary secretary has got to answer is: why has it taken his government four years to discover there is a drought in this country? Why is it allowing people virtually to be on the point of starvation, virtually on the point of suicide?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this were happening to tens of thousands of people in the centre of Sydney and Melbourne, there would be absolute outrage and his government would do something about it. But because it is in the bush, because it is a drought that creeps up slowly, the government does absolutely nothing. The parliamentary secretary would be well advised to sit over there and keep quiet, because he does not know what he is talking about; he has no solutions to this drought; he is doing absolutely nothing about this drought and really deserves the condemnation of this nation. Wait until we get to the ballot box next time. I can tell him where the marginal seats are in this country. They happen to be out in rural and regional Australia and people in those areas are going to bag the government like hell when it comes to the next election because it has done absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought is affecting eastern Australia. When the government is not aiding in any shape or form 96 per cent of the farmers, and is giving absolutely no attention at all to small businesses in Australia in drought affected country&mdash;one-third of whom Telecom Yellow Pages claim are going to collapse in the near future because of lack of aid&mdash;then it is on the government's head and the effects are going to come back on it. The history of Australia over the last 15 years shows that this is a temporary boom we are in and that we will be in a downslide in the not too distant future, particularly if the government keeps jacking up interest rates and doing nothing about fiscal policy. If that is the case, then this drought and the effects on rural Australia will come back on the government well and truly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I thank Senator Panizza for that interjection. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary should sit down with some of the leaders of the civic communities in rural Australia. I challenge him to go to Moree and listen to the people in the Chamber of Commerce. Is the parliamentary secretary aware that at this cotton harvest time in Moree people are going on holidays because there is nothing to harvest? Normally 300 seasonal workers come into Moree to harvest the crop, but no-one is coming as there is nothing to harvest. This has sucked $5 million out of the rural economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What effect does that have on small businesses in those areas? I invite the parliamentary secretary to interject again and outline to this parliament what his federal government is doing for the small business sector that is affected by the drought&mdash;the one-third that are likely to collapse. What is the parliamentary secretary doing about the infrastructure of the towns of rural and regional Australia that are about to collapse? Because there is no farming income, the small businesses are hit for six and so is the rest of the rural economy. The parliamentary secretary does well to keep quiet, because his government really has no policy to respond to this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the parliamentary secretary know what his colleague the member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) said should happen? Harry Woods is sitting on a margin of 100 votes. Harry Woods says that what the farmers should do is rely on the farmhand fund. Is that not terrific? Rely on charity. We have no government policy to help them but they can rely on charity. The farmhand fund is a great thing; it is doing great work but it is patchy in the way it hits rural and regional Australia. The Moree Chamber of Commerce told us that it could find only two people in Moree, which is one of the most drought devastated areas in Australia, who are receiving any money at all from that fund. Two people! I ask the parliamentary secretary: what happens to the rest of Moree? They do not get anything from his government, because basically his government does not care. It does not consider them its constituents so it just leaves them to hang in the middle of this worst drought in 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast to what the parliamentary secretary has done, we have the excellent record of the Fahey government, which has much more limited resources than those of the parliamentary secretary. In August $22 million went in sensitively directed aid, followed by another $66 million since. It is not just a handout but it is comprehensive in providing rate relief, in getting fodder and water through to these areas; in providing cloud seeding to improve rain, in offering agistment of stock on state government land and in assisting small business through interest rate subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the state government is doing. The New South Wales coalition government is responding sensitively to this matter. But the parliamentary secretary is not doing anything that is really effective. The only reason he got into it in the first place was the farmhand fund that raised money across Australia. People in urban areas woke up to how desperate things were in the bush. This happened and then the government begrudgingly came out with its mean-spirited package which offered money. With its usual trick, it quoted in one sum the money that will be made available over four years. We have to divide that $164 million by four to get to the annualised figure. Of course, 94 per cent of the drought affected farms will be missed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, my colleague Senator Troeth, Judi Moylan&mdash;our shadow minister for small business&mdash;Sandy Macdonald and I appeared at a drought forum in Casino. It is a great pity the parliamentary secretary and Paul Keating were not there. Those 80 farmers and the people associated with the farm industry told us about the problems in regional and rural Australia because of this drought that the government has totally neglected. The parliamentary secretary should have heard what they had to say, not only the farmers but people like Lifeline counsellors. It is a pity the parliamentary secretary is not listening to this, given his earlier outrageous interjections. He obviously does not care, as the rest of the ALP does not care about this particular problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he has got to realise is that his drought package has to be far more sensitive to the actual conditions in this country. It might surprise the parliamentary secretary that a drought in an area like northern New South Wales, which normally has a high rainfall, can be far more devastating over the same number of months than a drought, say, in the western division of New South Wales, which is used to low rainfall. The vegetation and the fauna and the flora and the beasts there have made adjustments to the conditions they live under but that is not so in areas of normally high rainfall. Yet the government has this blanket rule: people must have had drought for 24 out of 36 months. Is that not terrific? The government has just supplied one blanket rule which has no sensitivity to the different ways in which the drought is affecting particular areas like the north coast and the Upper Hunter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case the parliamentary secretary is not aware of the pain and suffering and the circumstances that people are going through out there in the bush, let me read him a story that was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Newcastle Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. This is the story of a Margaret Flannigan who lives on a property 45 minutes west of Scone. It is an area that does not quite make that 24 out of 36 months&mdash;it has occasionally had a good month of rain&mdash;so it does not count. However, the area is severely drought affected. Let me tell the Senate about Margaret Flannigan's situation. Margaret's husband is away for four months droving cattle in the long paddocks beside the road in order to keep them alive. She is wondering how she is going to cope. She has three children, she is pregnant and she is there managing the property. The creek has dried up and Margaret and the kids spend 17 hours a day dragging cattle and sheep from black soil bogs around depleted dams. They then have to give the sheep and cattle molasses and other feed supplements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A farmer in Casino showed me his bill for supplementary feed. He spends $22,000 a year on feed that normally comes naturally but which he now has to provide. He is receiving absolutely no income, but has to spend $22,000 just to keep his stock alive. Obviously, the government is doing nothing for him, and nothing for Margaret Flannigan out west of Scone. Even if the government's package did get to her, it would not do very much to solve the problem: it is a matter of too little, too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the situation in drought affected Australia is best summed up by the president of the New South Wales Farmers Federation, Ted Henderson.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two very serious matters which occurred yesterday and which raise the gravest concerns about the competence of the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. These matters raise very serious doubts as to whether the minister is fit to continue in the job. They also raise the further very serious issue of whether the minister has been misleading this Senate for a number of weeks now. The minister has claimed that, in relation to the Oyster Point-Port Hinchinbrook project, he was relying on advice. It is fairly clear from the evidence that the federal minister and the department were aware of the complete proposals for Port Hinchinbrook for some many months.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the documents that Senator Faulkner tabled yesterday, as a result of the Senate's motion that he be required to do so, one of the most interesting documents is a memorandum from the department to the minister dated 22 September 1994. That advice from the department to Senator Faulkner had three major recommendations. The first recommendation or comment was at paragraph 21, which said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst maintaining reservations about the overall proposal as expressed at paragraph 16, the portfolio is generally satisfied that Queensland's approach, if fully adhered to, could address the four major areas of concern in relation to World Heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>There is advice from the minister's department that the Queensland approach would address any concerns that there might be. There was another recommendation at paragraph 20, where the department advises the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deed of Agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which has been referred to in the Senate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a comprehensive document and represents an approach not unlike what might have been expected from a full environmental impact assessment (EIA) process.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst I and my staff are still going through it, that seems to fly in the face of what Senator Faulkner and other Labor senators have been saying about the non-existence of an environmental impact assessment and environmental impact report by the Queensland government over this period of time. Yet, in the minister's own departmental advice to him, that question is mentioned and the minister is told that that deed of agreement is of the same effect. Further, in the recommendation from the department to the minister of 22 September 1994 at paragraph 28, the department says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation from the portfolio is therefore not to take immediate action under the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the departmental advice. The document is tabled and the whole letter can be read by the world. On 15 November the minister then had the Governor-General make a proclamation stopping work on the Oyster Point development. We questioned the minister about this and said, `You've known about this for months now. You've known that the mangrove trees along the foreshore were to be destroyed as part of the deed of agreement which your department has had for many months. Why is it now that after so many months you have changed your mind and you've stopped work?' The minister's response was, `I've got recent scientific evidence which requires me to do it and which shows that there will be an impact on the World Heritage values, on the seagrass beds, if those mangroves are destroyed.' That was on 15 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other interesting documents that Senator Faulkner was forced to table yesterday is a letter dated 14 November&mdash;I emphasise that as being the day before Senator Faulkner stopped work on the project. On 14 November the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority wrote to David Kay, the Assistant Secretary of Senator Faulkner's department. All senators would know that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is the leading expert on the Great Barrier Reef and northern tropical waters. All senators would also know the very high esteem and regard in which the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority is held. In that letter from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to Senator Faulkner's department on the day before he stopped work, paragraph 6 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expert opinion by experienced surveyors is that the seagrasses within the potential arc of influence of the dredging can be protected by appropriate management . . . it is our belief that the effects of dredging will be much greater, in terms of sediment release, than the removal of mangroves, and that removal of regrowth mangroves presents very little threat to the seagrasses beds.</PARA>
<PARA>There we have, from this respected authority, the comment that the removal of regrowth mangroves prevents very little threat to seagrass beds. How can Senator Faulkner say that that sort of evidence, which was available to him the day before, caused him to issue that stop-work notice?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, Senator Faulkner has relied upon a report which he obtained from a Dr Valentine. When he was taking that report around he was saying how well Dr Valentine was regarded in environmental matters, although there were suggestions raised in the Senate that perhaps this was not as appropriate a person to give a report as could have been selected.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a letter dated 14 November, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We caution against basing any decisions solely on the opinions of either Dr Valentine or Mr Haigh and recommend seeking the views of seagrass, mangrove and dugong experts.</PARA>
<PARA>There is that recommendation, on the day before. I want Senator Faulkner to identify for the Senate and for the people of Australia just what it was&mdash;what recent evidence that he had before 15 November&mdash;which caused him to issue that stop-work notice. The most recent evidence, the letter from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, seems to be quite to the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> From that point, Senator Faulkner made what I suggest was a very desperate attempt to get himself out of the corner he had painted himself into. He was trying to do something about the exposition that this was, as Mr Goss said, nothing to do with the environment but all about internal Labor Party politics&mdash;the Left versus the Right, the payback for the knocking off of the Queensland left-wing member who was the Labor Party president but who was knocked off by Mr Goss and his right-wing faction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what did Senator Faulkner do? He set up a workshop of experts, convened:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to develop a consensus about the impacts of the development on the seagrass beds and other World Heritage values and ways to prevent adverse impacts. The focus will be on clearing of mangroves and related foreshore modifications.</PARA>
<PARA>What did this workshop of experts that Senator Faulkner set up come out with? This report was released very late last night. At page 4 it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research shows that seagrasses in north-eastern Australia can tolerate and recover from considerable disturbance. Seagrasses can be lost from severe short term events such as storms or through deterioration in water quality . . . However, seagrasses have the capacity to recover.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Research also indicates that in some tropical and sub-tropical areas, seagrasses have been unaffected by nearby dredging. The Working Group considered that a significant input of sediment adjacent to the development site would give a moderate risk of localised loss of seagrasses but recognised that there would be a high probability of recovery (within about 12 months) . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is the workshop of experts saying what I said yesterday, in this parliament, in a much less scientific and a much more ordinary way. Local people had told me that. They had never been consulted by Senator Faulkner&mdash;he was too lacking in intestinal fortitude to go and talk to the locals. Had he done that he might have saved himself enormous embarrassment and what I suggest should be an end to his career as a minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report of the workshop of experts goes on to point out that there are approximately 2,400 square kilometres of mangroves in tropical Queensland. In the Hinchinbrook Channel there are 164 square kilometres. There are 38 different species. The effect on fisheries habitat and coastal food chains around Oyster Point of the direct act of the removal of foreshore mangroves would be minimal compared to the total resource in the channel. So there is this report saying that for the small amount removed the effect on the fisheries habitat and coastal food chains in the total resource would be absolutely minimal. The working group's view was that the removal of the four hectares of mangroves could have an impact on the adjacent seagrasses. But the report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this gives a moderate risk of localised seagrass loss adjacent to the development. However, there would be high probability of recovery (within about 12 months) . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the short term, the potential for sediment loss on the foreshore due to removal of the 4 ha of mangrove will be minimised if no more root material is removed.</PARA>
<PARA>If the trees were entirely removed it could cause some problems, but if the root stocks stay there it is okay. The whole report puts a view absolutely contrary to what Senator Faulkner has been telling this Senate for the past four to five weeks. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If management is good, the development may have minimal effects on mangroves and seagrass.</PARA>
<PARA>But it does point out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current state of the site poses a significant erosion hazard with the imminent onset of the wet season.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I have been warning Senator Faulkner about this. He stopped the development. It is half done. It is in absolutely the worst possible condition. Any local in North Queensland will tell you that if you are disturbing soil you have got to get it fixed up before the wet season comes; otherwise you cause all sorts of erosion problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner, the so-called environment minister, has absolutely plagued the environment in that area by stopping work and making sure that it will not start again before the onset of the wet season. We are now in for real environmental problems as a result of Senator Faulkner's incompetence&mdash;as a result of him playing politics with this matter rather that worrying about the environment. The report continues, refuting time and time again the things that Senator Faulkner has been telling this parliament over the last four to five weeks. I urge all senators to look at the material that was tabled yesterday and this report of the workshop of experts, because they are very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Something needs to be done. I have asked Senator Faulkner to go and talk to the people. He has refused to do that. I want him now to apologise for the 40 jobs which he has cost that local community. I want him to apologise for the costs of $1 million that will be added to that project. More particularly, I want him to apologise for the division that he has caused in the once friendly and happy community of Cardwell. Senator Faulkner has a lot to answer for, and he really must apologise and do something about it now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a brief contribution to the matters of public interest debate this afternoon. As part of the Liberal Party's 50th birthday celebrations around Australia it conducted a national essay competition. In our true federalist style as a party, we also awarded prizes for essays that were of particular value in each state. In Tasmania the winner was Donovan Walker, who is in grade 10 at Parklands High School. The essay competition was arranged by former distinguished senator Shirley Walters and Guy Barnett on behalf of the Liberal Party. The three people who judged the competition were Michael Bennett, Professor of History at the University of Tasmania; Keith Mackriell, ABC correspondent and broadcast manager; and Julie Roberts, President of the Tasmanian State Schools Parents and Friends Association.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In their letter back to the Liberal Party they indicated some things that should be brought to the attention of the Senate. They all agreed that the quality of the many essays is very high, making their decision about the top three entries particularly difficult. I take this opportunity to congratulate Kate Griffiths of Burnie High School and Kate Willoughby of St Brendon Shaw College on receiving the second and third prizes respectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The judges of the competition thought it appropriate that the quality of these essays be given a wide audience and, as a result, the Liberal Party published the essays. They also suggested that every possible effort be made towards providing a larger forum for the essays. I intend to read to the Senate the winning contribution by Donovan Walker, which he entitled `What being an Australian means to me'. Donovan's essay is optimistic, it has a balance of pride in Australia without going overboard and it reflects a lot of values. It gives me confidence in the future generation of young Australians which is growing up in this great country. The essay is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most people from any area of the world dream of living on an island. I live on the largest island in the world. There is no other place like it and it is this isolation that has made my home an incomparable, unique country. I live in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For me, being an Australian means optimism and opportunity. We have been called the "lucky country" but we make our own luck by working with positive attitudes and taking on tasks with a special blend of enthusiasm, enterprise and courage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To be an Australian means to grow up in a society with freedom of choice. This is a luxury that we should never take for granted. I can have the confidence to publicly speak my mind without the concern of being fined or thrown into prison. I can also choose the path that I wish to follow in my career, in my choice of religion, and in the political party that, I think, will give me the best future. I can travel and explore any part of the country I wish, to explore the truth of our culture and heritage. All Australians have these freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australians are individuals like no other people in the world. With our `laid back' attitudes, we are sometimes mistaken for being lazy and apathetic. The `She'll be right, mate' cliche seems to fit us very well. Though, admittedly, we are sometimes easy going, we are a thoughtful and optimistic nation. We never feel the need to rush or hurry blindly into things before they are carefully considered. This is a real advantage. We have a relatively stable political system, a friendly rivalry between states and a united but not fanatical, national pride. Many other countries, like America, Europe and Asia have experienced the brutality of civil war where countrymen and neighbours become sworn enemies. Australia has had no real experience of this. However, we are prepared to defend the rights of others and to stand up for what we believe in. We are also tolerant of other cultures and of people with differing backgrounds and welcome their contributions to our developing sense of nationhood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is not afraid to take its place in the world in a responsible and sensitive way. We have been leaders encouraging world sanctions to protest against the injustice in South Africa when harsh Apartheid laws could no longer be ignored. We have also provided aid to developing countries in both Africa and Asia and have been more than generous in our response to world disasters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that this is a sensible and responsible attitude from which other countries should learn. It has given us a sense of pride in our country and its people whilst enhancing the tight bond that continues to grow across Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we grow towards true independence as a Nation there remains a feeling of `mateship' and companionship that is so vital to this land. Australians respect this rare quality, as they do the land and its people. These qualities that have made Australia what it is today are more valuable than anything any other country could offer. So when I am asked, "What does it mean to be an Australian?", I think of our vast coast lines and endless beaches, the magnificent red centre and the fertile coastal plains, the exotic plants and animals, the warm and friendly people with a wide range of attitudes and beliefs and their unique outlook on life and I would not want to be anywhere else.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the contribution of Donovan to the national essay competition. Those who have just listened to his contribution would undoubtedly agree that he was a worthy winner of the first prize. His contribution was truly Australia, it was optimistic, it was indicative of the balanced pride he felt in his country and he displayed a good use of language. In short, his contribution was excellent, and I have great pleasure in taking this opportunity to afford my congratulations to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on this occasion because I heard only part of Senator Ian Macdonald's contribution&mdash;I did not hear it all. I feel there is a need to clarify a number of issues in relation to the scientists' report on the Port Hinchinbrook development, because I think that senators would agree that, just as few politicians can totally agree on issues, few economists can agree on issues, so scientists can have differing opinions and differing emphases. The conclusions in this report are instructive in pointing to the direction in which the developer at Hinchinbrook and the three levels of government should be working, if the current impasse is to be resolved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I obviously commend the very strong stand that Senator Faulkner has taken, I think we all agree&mdash;Senator Faulkner obviously agrees&mdash;that we must resolve this current impasse. It is not going to help for people to continually argue about the fine details of who said what, when and who was more to `blame' than the other. As we have said a number of times in this place, the issues are basically very simple. Sometimes simple issues are more readily confused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, this is about a project that got through the Office of Coordinator-General without a full environmental impact assessment, an EIA. That is a process that most people around Australia expect&mdash;an environmental, economic and social impact assessment. That assessment was never done. I do not know why it was not done. Maybe the Office of the Coordinator-General is new to these issues and thought that an environmental review would be adequate. Clearly, events illustrate to us that an environmental review has been totally inadequate. That is really where everything went wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald has been critical of Senator Faulkner's role. I guess, from an opposition perspective, one could argue that that is Senator Macdonald's role. If senators read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and letters that Senator Faulkner has released, they would find that Senator Faulkner spent many months working through these issues, trying to resolve what he knew was a complex and difficult issue, but trying to resolve it in the best possible way to protect World Heritage values. He did not once say, `No, this development must never go ahead.' He said, `My responsibility is to protect World Heritage values.' He had the Valentine report. He has talked to Minister Robson; he has talked to Premier Goss; he has talked to the developer. He also commissioned the work of the one-day meeting of scientists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it depends which sections of the scientists' report that are quoted and which idea is sought to be clarified. I want to put very firmly on the public record, as I believe I have done on other occasions, that this issue is not a win or lose issue. In terms of World Heritage and the Franklin dam debate, someone had to give way. It was hydro-electricity or World Heritage, and World Heritage was seen as the more significant. In the case of the wet tropics, it was the timber industry or World Heritage, and World Heritage was seen as more significant in that instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, the two are quite compatible. There can be a resort; World Heritage values can be protected. There has been a failure at government level, and we can debate why that has happened. We have had a failure at government level to move in adequately at the right time and to set the right standards so that the developer, Mr Williams, would know precisely what he could and could not do and what protections were necessary for this area. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Ian Macdonald" NAMEID="YW4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald will not be surprised to hear that I blame the Office of the Coordinator-General because I do not think the World Heritage issue even dawned on it. I think it just thought that this was another fast-track development and away it went. Look what has happened as a result! We might differ on this. That is the background, Mr Acting Deputy President. I know you are very interested in and concerned about the mangroves, so I will talk about that aspect now. I have highlighted what I see as fundamental to this argument. The conclusions say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seagrass beds in the Hinchinbrook Channel are a significant resource and a valuable feature of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Scientific evidence indicates that turbidity is a significant factor affecting the growth and the distribution of seagrass communities.</PARA>
<PARA>So there is agreement on that point. All the scientists, regardless of their differences on a few other points, agree that the seagrass beds are a significant resource and a valuable feature of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage area. It is Senator Faulkner's responsibility to protect that World Heritage area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do the scientists suggest? I must admit that I like people who prepare a report to make some recommendations. That is what I expect in a report. I find it a little frustrating in this report that the authors draw conclusions and do not make recommendations. Nevertheless, these are the conclusions that they have come to. They talk about future short-term actions and they say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future short term actions should therefore be aimed at stabilising the sediments in the foreshore area of Oyster Point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.the remaining mangrove root stocks should remain in situ; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.removal of felled mangrove material should be completed in such a way as to minimise disturbance to sediments.</PARA>
<PARA>I have tried to be somewhat conciliatory on a number of issues relating to this dispute, but I must admit that I find it rather difficult to be conciliatory towards the developer, Mr Williams, when he said last night on the ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> that he wanted to get rid of all the mangroves, wherever they are. I do not see how someone who wants the value of an ecotourist development between two World Heritage areas can say that he wants to get rid of the mangroves. It is a contradiction in terms. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Campbell" NAMEID="H15">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator Campbell</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XI4">Senator REYNOLDS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would say to Senator Campbell that what people say under pressure is always debatable. I will agree to leave that point there. In the longer term, the scientists say, development of the foreshore requires a foreshore management plan. Frankly, I cannot see how a foreshore management plan includes a beach. If we are going to protect the roots of the mangroves, if we are going to ensure that there is a recognition of the significance of mangroves to seagrass beds as a valuable feature of World Heritage, I see that beach as inconsistent. The boardwalk concept through the mangroves is unique and much more likely to attract tourism than, as I have said before, an artificial beach on a channel&mdash;a channel that has crocodiles, not to mention marine stingers at certain times of the year. The report goes on to note that mangroves provide an effective means of stabilising such foreshores and that the two species that presently constitute the narrow fringe readily coppice and can be trimmed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With every respect to my colleagues in Queensland, I believe that no-one can say that there has been high quality site management to date, when we look at what happened in the removal of those mangroves and the subsequent vandalism with chainsaws. No-one can say that that is high quality site management. That is why it is so important that top level discussions between federal, state and local government and the developer are held as soon as practicable. The four respective parties need to sit down and say, `Right. What is possible? What is not possible? What are we going to do to ensure that we can balance the needs of a World Heritage area with the needs of many tourists who will, no doubt, want to utilise the resort facilities that Mr Williams wants to provide?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer to a point that I do not think was mentioned by Senator Macdonald. I apologise in advance if it was. It concerns dugongs and turtles, a much more significant drawcard to Mr Williams's tourist resort than crocodiles and marine stingers. The report states that the adult survivorship of dugongs and turtles must be very high&mdash;greater than 90 per cent&mdash;for dugong and green turtle populations to be maintained. This is influenced by food availability. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seagrass is an important source of food for dugongs and green turtles; however, not all seagrasses are of equal importance . . . Should there be a local loss of seagrass in the vicinity of Oyster Point, this would reduce food availability to dugongs and green turtles . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, while the scientists have come up with some very important points for consideration, they have not yet absolutely made a recommendation in relation to mangroves, except to say that mangroves are essential for stabilisation and mangroves are critical to the protection of those vital seagrass beds if we are to guarantee the survival of dugong and turtles. </PARA>

Firstly, Senator Tierney mentioned that only two people were receiving support in the Moree area. I find that difficult to believe as Moree is one of our exceptional circumstance areas and people in that area would be eligible for drought relief payment, which can provide a family with around $20,000 per year. Farmers in the Moree area should be approaching the Rural Assistance Authority for an exceptional circumstance certificate in order to receive their fortnightly payments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3542" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To say there is an economic crisis confronting Australia at the moment is so far from the truth as to be absolutely ludicrous. The reality of the matter is that the national accounts figures that have been released today show that this country is unequivocally riding a boom and, moreover, that the circumstances of that boom are such that the growth that we are achieving is sustainable at a very high rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The boom is something that should not be the subject of the kind of negative carping response we are getting from the opposition. It is terrific news for Australians, in particular those Australians who have been out of work. We have had 13 consecutive quarters of trend growth. We have just recorded growth on year to year to the September quarter of 6.4 per cent, which makes us, right now, at the top of the table so far as the major OECD economies are concerned. That growth has meant that we are well on the way to putting unemployed Australians absolutely back to work, with 403,000 new jobs created since April 1993, the bottom of the trough, with 90,000 of those jobs being for the long-term unemployed, and with extraordinarily good prospects for those who are still out of work because of the sustainability of the present growth environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not facing a bust because all these circumstances are different from those that we had to confront before. The basic difference is that inflation and inflationary expectations are at historically low levels. We have seen from this morning's figures the basic inflation rate&mdash;the GDP non-farm deflator&mdash;coming in at just 1.1 per cent for the last 12 months. We are talking of basic rates of inflation of around two per cent now as compared with seven or eight per cent at a similar time in the last recovery, with expectations realised last time of 10 to 11-plus per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a current account deficit&mdash;yes&mdash;which is growing because of the surge of capital imports feeding the investment boom at the moment, but also about a current account deficit running now at 4.1 per cent of GDP as compared with 6.1 per cent at exactly the same stage of the last recovery cycle. We are talking about an environment of fundamental, achieved structural change, which means that we can continue to look forward to major exports in a way that simply was not the case before&mdash;a sustainable growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about continuing excess capacity in the Australian economy, which will clearly ease any demands that might otherwise be building up towards inflation. We are talking about a very strong productivity dimension to wage bargaining, which is going to keep that wage pressure under control. We are talking overall about a rolling recovery that is by its very nature much more sustainable than the kind we saw before when every component of demand came together simultaneously to create an acceleration in the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a boom on this occasion that began with an increase in consumer demand and dwelling investment, with business investment phasing in, cutting in, at a later stage. We are now seeing a potential falling back in that private consumption, certainly a falling back in dwelling expenditure, but a maintenance at the same time and an expansion of business investment. So we have an environment of sustained recovery and sustainable recovery which is very different.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course we are conscious of the need for the Australian economy not to overheat. Of course it is the case that fiscal and monetary policy will both continue to be adjusted accordingly. But let no one misunderstand, and let no one understate, the magnitude of the achievement that has been made with the Australian economy and the figures that stand there on the record to back that achievement up.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is another piece of good news. In contrast to the last piece of good news, I thought the opposition would welcome this piece of good news. Several of its number were at the awards last night, and I was very pleased to see them there in what was a bipartisan spirit of support for successful Australian exporters. I was very grateful for that support, and the exporters were grateful for it&mdash;and I hope we do not undermine it here today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did have the honour of attending last night's awards and presenting the Australian Exporter of the Year Award. I was pleased that senators from all parties were there supporting this important event. It was appropriate that they should have been there, and it was an appropriate celebration of the achievement of Australians who are engaged in a very important walk of life for Australia&mdash;that is, exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of those who attended last night from the Democrats, the National Party and the Liberals, I think acknowledge that we saw a unanimous expression of view from the judges that the standard of entrants in the export category was the highest seen in the 31 years of the award, and that the finalists from all over Australia represented the new cutting edge of successful export across a range of industry sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winners were from several states. We had PBR Automotive from Victoria; Hawker de Haviland Australian Aviation College from South Australia; and Argyle Diamonds from Western Australia. From Western Australia we also had Aussie Lobsters&mdash;from the point of view of a Minister for Trade who is allergic to seafood, this was not one of the great awards of all time; nevertheless, that company was a very worthy winner&mdash;and Intellect Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winner of the Australian Exporter of the Year Award was Intellect Australia from Western Australia, whose hand-held pin pad has already captured about 70 per cent of the Australian market and a $12 million market overseas for electronic banking products. So it was a very good night for Western Australia. But the winners represented a wide cross-section Australia's export performance in commodities and new areas in manufactures and services, and point to a very encouraging future for Australia's export performance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A really encouraging feature of last night's event was the clear indication of government&mdash;that is, Commonwealth and state government&mdash;and industry, public and private, working together on the `team Australia approach' to create a favourable trading environment. Several of the exporters appreciated and commented upon the support they had received from the government in being able to achieve their export successes&mdash;including, as I recall, the winner. More and more of them are targeting the new markets and opportunities in the Asia-Pacific. But not only there, of course. Some of them are succeeding in Western Europe, North America, Latin America and other important markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night's event was a very important exercise in encouraging and recognising the achievements of our exporters. How well our exporters do will be a key determinant of how long we can go on generating the tremendous rate of growth that Senator Gareth Evans just reported to the Senate, and whether we can get the current account deficit down in a way that makes that rate of growth sustainable. Exports are very important for that, and that is why the 6.4 per cent growth that we have reported is good news for everybody, except 36 people in here. Every other Australian will welcome it. It is good news for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we did last night was congratulate people who are making a significant contribution to sustaining that.

I notice that the Treasurer has said that this rate of growth is too high to be sustained over a protracted period. We expect some moderation in demand. But he has also pointed out significantly that the accounts confirm that the strong growth in the Australian economy is accompanied by a very low level of inflation. The Bureau of Industry Economics summarises the national accounts by pointing to the key points. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Growth in GDP (Average) during the September 1994 quarter came in at 1.3 per cent to give an annual rate of economic growth of 6.4 per cent. In trend terms, June quarter growth was measured at 1.2 per cent giving an annual growth rate of 5.8 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Private consumption expenditure rose by 2.0 per cent while Government consumption expenditure fell by 2.3 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Business investment rose by 3.5 per cent in the September quarter. Plant and equipment spending rose by 7.0 per cent while expenditure on non-dwelling construction fell by 5.7 per cent&mdash;mainly due to the sale of a building to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria for $250 million. Private dwelling investment rose 3.4 per cent. Public investment rose 15.6 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Changes in stock levels added 0.3 percentage points to GDP growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Net exports deducted 1.8 per cent from GDP growth with exports down by 0.4 per cent and imports 8.5 per cent higher.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.On the income side, Wages, salaries and supplements rose by 1.6 per cent in the September quarter 1994 to be 6.8 per cent higher than a year earlier. The gross operating surplus (profits) of private corporate trading enterprises rose by 7.1 per cent in the September quarter to be 11.3 per cent higher than the same quarter last year.</PARA>
<PARA>The commentary on these statistics by the bureau is interesting. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The September quarter GDP result was above market expectations of around 1.1 per cent, and leaves Australia with the highest rate&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise `the highest rate'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of economic growth in the OECD. The main features of the September result were strong positive contributions from private consumption and public investment, while a significant increase in imports made a large negative contribution to GDP growth. Importantly, business investment grew for the fourth consecutive quarter, to be 22.2 per cent higher than in the September quarter 1993. Purchases of equipment rose by 7.0 per cent during the quarter, to be a very healthy 30 per cent higher than a year ago. This is in line with the rises seen in imports of capital goods over recent times. Company profits rose by a further 7.1 per cent over the quarter to be 11.3 per cent higher than a year earlier&mdash;further encouragement for investment prospects over the next year.</PARA>
<PARA>Let me cut to the last line of the analysis of these figures. In bold black type it states:</PARA>

Mochovce consists of four partially completed Soviet designed VVER440/213 reactors with enhanced safety design features, although I understand that only two reactors are being considered for completion. In addition, completion of reactors at the Mochovce nuclear power plant will allow the closure of two VVER reactors currently in operation at another power plant in Slovakia&mdash;that is, the Bohunice power plant&mdash;and which are considered by the EBRD to present a higher safety risk.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of media reports that quote Martin Miriori, a BRA supporter resident in Honiara, as having declared an end to the cease-fire which has been in effect on Bougainville for the past two months. I have also noted reports that BRA leaders have threatened to kill Bougainvilleans who have entered into peace negotiations with the PNG government. Needless to say, if true, these are extremely disappointing reports. Those sentiments are profoundly regrettable and totally at odds with the wishes of the great majority of Bougainvilleans who so forcefully demonstrated their desire for peace at the peace conference held in October. I guess, though, in some respects comments of this kind would hardly be surprising, following their decision not to attend the Bougainville peace conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The BRA leadership has been sidelined as Bougainvilleans have got on with the practical business of discussing administrative and political arrangements for Bougainville with the PNG government. The BRA leadership now appears to have adopted a strategy of seeking to hold the peace process to ransom through the issuing of threats. It does not appear interested in talking either to the PNG government or even to its fellow Bougainvilleans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far more promising, however, is the progress toward peace that is being made in discussions between the PNG government and prominent Bougainvilleans, including representatives of the interim authorities, which has led to the signing in Port Moresby just a few days ago on 25 November of the charter of Mirigini for a new Bougainville. The charter commits the parties to step up the pace and momentum of bringing normalcy to services and legal authority to Bougainville. It provides for the establishment of a Bougainville transitional government by March 1995 to replace the former North Solomons provincial government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transitional government will have the task of reviewing the province's existing constitution in line with positions to be agreed during further negotiation with the PNG government. Sir Julius Chan, the Prime Minister, has already allocated approximately $1.7 million to facilitate this process.</PARA>

That could not be the case without the very strong personal commitment being shown by Sir Julius Chan to finding a peaceful political resolution. We commend him for that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say that during this week I have also had some quite encouraging discussions with my newly appointed Solomon Islands counterpart, Danny Philip, the foreign minister, who is visiting Australia. Mr Philip and I agreed that, while Bougainville remained very much a matter for the Papua New Guineans themselves to resolve, both Australia and the Solomon Islands, and particularly, of course, the Solomon Islands as next-door neighbours, are certainly in a position to offer constructive support to that particular process.</PARA>

The level of support under the new arrangements will be unchanged from the existing dairy plan, which has served the industry well by providing a secure framework for adjustment. The stability of the producing sector, consistent growth in production and investment, rapid expansion in exports, and the rationalisation of the processing sector, are all proof of the benefits flowing from the industry arrangements put in place since 1986.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements will be introduced on 1 July 1995, or after the World Trade Organisation agreement comes into force for Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legislation to terminate the present market support scheme from 1 July 1995 or the next 1 July after the World Trade Organisation Agreement comes into force for Australia is before Parliament.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given that the scheme had to be changed, the Government has opted for a transparent and clearly identifiable domestic market support scheme, which is consistent with GATT and meets Australia's commitments under the Uruguay Round .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mechanism selected is an input levy on milk used in the manufacture of dairy products. The levy will be paid by manufacturers into Consolidated Revenue and then appropriated to the Australian Dairy Corporation, which will administer the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Corporation will rebate exports to manufacturers on presentation of documentary evidence and pay the balance of the levy, less administrative costs, as support to manufacturing milk producers. Manufacturers will therefore be able to either recoup the levy paid through the export rebate or pass it on to consumers. There should be no increase in the price of dairy products as the consumer transfer will be no greater than that generated under the current scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy will be adjusted annually to generate receipts equal to the consumer transfer, which would have been provided under the 1992 Plan, subject to the maximum levels specified in the present legislation, which are reducing annually.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As requested by industry, the all milk levy on market milk will be continued at the current rate, generating a transfer within the industry of about $35 million from market milk to manufacturing milk producers. The total support flowing to the manufacturing milk sector is estimated at about $135 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is concerned to ensure that there is a smooth transition to the new scheme, preserving normal cash flows as much as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Due to the practice by manufacturers of pre-paying the expected export support payment and consumer transfer under the current scheme to the producer in the price paid for milk received, stocks on hand at 30 June 1995 will contain a notional levy of about two cents per litre milk equivalent. These stocks will not be eligible for export rebate under the new scheme as they were not subject to statutory levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is keen to ensure that manufacturers are not disadvantaged in the changeover, or the new scheme put at risk. Accordingly, the Government has decided to allow the Australian Dairy Corporation to make special arrangements using industry funded borrowings to smooth the transition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Imports of dairy products will be unaffected but will be closely monitored by industry and Government to ensure that Australian manufacturers and the producers that supply them are not disadvantaged in their own domestic market. An import offset arrangement along the lines of that currently in force will be continued with respect to export rebates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new market support arrangements will continue to provide a sound framework for industry as it adjusts to the phasing out of support in 2000. The Government's position is that there will be no legislated support beyond 30 June 2000.</PARA>

I indicated to this chamber not so long ago that the government would not be deviating from the scheduled and legislated-for selling of wool&mdash;which I think Senator Panizza would have endorsed.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the sport of athletics there were 10,400 tests conducted by IOC accredited laboratories in 1991; 11,300 in 1992; and 14,400 in 1993. The percentage of out-of-competition tests has increased each year. In Australia last year the Australian Sports Drug Agency conducted 369 tests on athletics participants, including 226 out-of-competition tests. The International Amateur Athletics Federation implements drug testing both in and out of competition. In 1993, 476 tests were conducted on athletes from 25 countries. In 1994, 800 tests were conducted. The IAAF announced the day before yesterday that it intends increasing the 1995 out-of-competition testing program to 1,200 tests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite this plan, the program is still not fully effective, as it is difficult to test many athletes at short notice. Only 10 out of the 204 member countries have national agencies such as ASDA. The mobility of international athletes also creates a problem with keeping up to date contact information on international athletes. It will only be with the cooperation of the IAAF, its member countries and the national agencies that testing programs will become more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that our athletes and Athletics Australia are concerned about the lack of effective testing, in particular of athletes from the USA. In an annual survey conducted this year by ASDA, 25 per cent of Australian athletes who responded believed that the USA was a country where drug use in sport was a problem; in comparison, 17 per cent thought China had a drug use problem. The Australian government, as you know, Mr President, is working hard to address those concerns. Steve Haines, the Chief Executive of ASDA, will meet with Dr Arne Ljungqvist, Chairman of the IAAF Medical Commission, next month to discuss the drugs in sport issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ASDA has recently signed an agreement with the IAAF to conduct an out of competition testing on its behalf in Australia and the Oceania region. I am looking at ways of working with my colleagues in the multilateral anti-doping agreement from Canada, Norway, the UK, France and New Zealand to pressure the IAAF to further advance its testing programs. The IAAF also announced yesterday that it intends to suspend an athlete after the first sample has tested positive rather than wait until the result of the B sample test. This is to speed up the entire doping control procedure as well as cut down on rumours. The IAAF states that the new rule will have no effect on an athlete's rights. Athletes will still have the right of the B test, the right of appeal and the right of a hearing. I will be considering this decision in light of the ASDA legislative review that is currently under way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With specific regard to the USA, ASDA is currently working with the Australian Olympic Committee to establish a testing agreement with the United States Olympic Committee. The USOC is responsible for implementing the testing program for Olympic sports in the US. Unfortunately, the USOC does not have responsibility for the US athletics testing program. The US athletics organisation conducts its own testing without the use of an independent body. Because of this closed shop, it has been difficult to get testing statistics from the US.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that our athletes are concerned about the situation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the explanation.</PARA>
<PARA>On 5 October 1994, I placed questions on notice for answer by the Attorney-General. To date, I have not received answers to those questions. The questions related to proposed changes to the corporations law to change the definitions of a `security' and a `futures contract' in order to allow the Australian Stock Exchange to trade a new product it has developed&mdash;a share ratio. The Attorney-General's handling of this issue has been unsatisfactory, to say the least; bungling and verging on the incompetent, to be somewhat more realistic. The failure to provide answers to the questions that I placed on notice confirms serious doubts about the ability of the Attorney's department to handle what is a difficult and complex area of regulatory policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The saga began earlier this year when the government introduced a draft omnibus Corporations Law Amendment Bill. When the final bill was introduced into parliament, slipped in was a provision that effectively allowed the government, by regulation, to completely alter the division between futures and securities regulation under the Corporations Law. The amendments were introduced to enable the Stock Exchange to trade an unnamed product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes were drafted in such a way that they had serious implications for the wholesale regulation of futures, securities and derivative markets. The changes were subject to institutional and opposition pressure, and the provisions were withdrawn by the Attorney-General. Following the withdrawal, the Stock Exchange announced the product that it wished to trade&mdash;a share ratio. The Attorney-General's Department put out an exposure package, which provided a draft bill and more details of the underpinning regulatory framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All along, the Sydney Futures Exchange has expressed its concern at the changes. It said that a share ratio was essentially a futures contract and should, therefore, be traded on a futures exchange. That concern was obviously directed at protecting its own turf. It has made no secret of that. The Sydney Futures Exchange said that, if a share ratio which exhibited the characteristics of a futures contract was to be traded on a stock exchange, it was necessary to create a level playing field between the two selling bodies. That is not an unreasonable suggestion to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on that basis that in October I asked the Attorney-General a series of detailed questions relating to licensing, clearing arrangements, investor knowledge and protection. To date, I have not received a response to those questions. In fact, it was clear from a very early stage that the Attorney-General and his department were either unwilling or unable to answer the questions themselves. It may surprise even you, Mr President, to learn how I know this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department sent my questions off to the Stock Exchange, asking it if it would like to complete the answers. The fact that the answers would be coming from the Stock Exchange has been confirmed to honourable senators on this side of the chamber by at least two senior officers of the Stock Exchange. In other words, some questions in relation to a detailed policy area were put on notice in the Attorney-General's portfolio. His department simply could not hack answering them, so it sent them off to one of the parties which had a vested interest in the change so it they could provide the answers. I find that absolutely unbelievable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government which has the responsibility to ensure that an appropriate regulatory framework exists for securities and futures markets. Ultimately, it must be the government that makes decisions on its own and brings those decisions to the parliament for approval. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Stock Exchange performs a very important independent regulatory function, it is still, in a sense, a commercial enterprise. Questions of broad shifts in existing regulatory frameworks need to be determined by the government and the parliament, not by one of the bodies that has a direct interest in the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not criticise the Stock Exchange for its part. Of course, it is going to present the argument in favour of its cause; it would be negligent if it did not. I am, however, scathingly critical of the government, which does not seem to have the ability to determine its own regulatory agenda: so much so, it goes to one of the parties&mdash;in this case, the Stock Exchange&mdash;seeking answers to questions that have been put on notice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not, as yet, have the answers to these questions, but we do have another bill which was introduced a couple of weeks ago. No doubt, some senators opposite are aware of the fact that there has been a further blunder. As I understand it&mdash;and the government has not denied it yet&mdash;the wrong bill was introduced. The Attorney-General walked in and introduced the wrong bill. We will soon see the proof of this, because there will be amendments to that bill. They will come under the generalised heading of `technical amendments' and will be designed to turn the bill the Attorney-General introduced into the one that he should have introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was intended to introduce a bill that allayed many of the concerns about a level playing field between the Sydney futures exchange and the Stock Exchange. Unbelievably, however, an earlier draft somehow was introduced by mistake. We all make mistakes. I do not know anybody who does not. But with 3,500 staff and with six months to think about it, I would have thought the Attorney-General could get at least that aspect right. This type of bungling hardly instils confidence in the Attorney-General or in his department as a federal watchdog of securities and futures regulations. The regulation of derivatives is a complex and challenging area and appears to be simply too big a task for the Attorney-General and his department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In conclusion, I ask honourable senators who may at some stage have insomnia and read <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> or who may be listening now to ask themselves, if they make a mistake in their tax or if a stockbroker or someone selling futures makes a mistake and the wrong bit of paper goes forward and there is a loss incurred and a drama, whether they think they could go before the Taxation Commissioner and try on the line, `It was just a mistake.' See whether they would be believed if they had 3,500 staff and six months to get the paperwork right. See whether they could get away with what the Attorney-General is trying to get away with. The answer is that they could not, because there is one rule for him and another for every other law abiding citizen. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Parer this day, relating to the east-west runway at Mascot airport. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collins's response was another Richo response to Senator Parer's question: it was simply false. He said that the fourfold rise in traffic levels was shown in the environmental impact study and that the public knew all about it. That is false because, while the EIS did say that there would be a fourfold increase, it would not be until the year 2010. That is 15 years away. In fact, the fourfold increase has happened immediately because of this government's incompetence and deliberate policy decision to shut down the east-west runway before the dual runway was in full operation. That was a deliberate government policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of that, there was a difference between the published flight plan that prevented turning after take-off for a distance of five miles, and an internal plan which was totally different, which was not revealed to the public and which showed that turns could be allowed after three miles. This meant sending aircraft over areas not publicly revealed as being subject to noise during the interim period before next March when the dual runway becomes properly operational on completion of the new control tower. The fact is that the government made a deliberate decision to cut off the east-west runway for normal operations even before the new runway was fully available for operational purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The government or the CAA, or both, lied to local  residents despite knowing the facts, particularly with knowledge of the concern expressed about this by the Federal Airports Corporation in a letter to the CAA printed in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> last week.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is an absolute conflict of interest, as Senator Parer says. To continue:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of the adoption of the interim arrangements would be that for approximately six months of those runway operations the affected suburbs would be subjected to the full numbers of aircraft operations described in the EIS rather than a gradual increase over the next 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA>So the minister&mdash;this minister for Richos&mdash;has misled us again. It is just incredible that he can come into this place and get away with this kind of nonsense. The minister is certainly aware that the dual north-south runway at Kingsford-Smith Airport will not be fully operational until next March when the new control tower is completed, yet a decision to close the east-west runway for normal traffic immediately the partially usable and much lower capacity dual runway was opened on an interim basis only by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to a great roll of drums on 8 November. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who made this decision to close the east-west runway, in light of the fact that the 1989 governmental promise to do so related to the dual runway becoming fully operational&mdash;not partially so on an interim basis? What we want to know is: did the right wing Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, whose electorate, along with that of his right wing colleague Mr Punch, has benefited from this decision to the severe disadvantage of electorates represented by left wing ministers Mr Baldwin and Mrs McHugh, approve this premature change? Was he made aware of the disastrous consequences of this decision for suburbs north of the airport before it was implemented?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why did the Acting Chief Executive Officer of the CAA refuse to answer these questions at last night's Senate estimates hearing? What has the government got to hide? Why did Minister Brereton say on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> on 23 November that part of the problem of the noise at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport was due to pilots getting used to the new operational requirements, that there is now a far greater compliance and that he intended to restrict the flying operations so that pilots stick to the centreline? Why did he say that the government intends to enforce that by legislation and quite draconian penalties to ensure that pilots do not deviate? The fact is that the CAA could provide no evidence whatsoever of pilots deviating. There has been no pilot deviation. This was a red herring dragged forward by the minister in another attempt to mislead the Senate. I am glad to see the chief misleader has now returned to the Senate. </PARA>

At last night's meeting it was estimated that some 300,000 or 400,000 people purchased homes not expecting, in their wildest dreams, that they would be under the flight path of planes which passed overhead every three or four minutes. They are understandably very angry people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of attending that meeting was to listen. If honourable senators have ever wanted to see rats running for cover, they should have heard the Labor mayors and the state Labor members who got up one after another and bucketed the minister, Mr Brereton. It supports the view given by Senator Robert Ray some years ago, which I thought was a ripper description of the Labor Party, that his faith in human nature was restored when self-interest won the day. If ever there was an example of rat runners and self-interest winning the day, it was the Deputy Leader of the Labor Party in New South Wales, Dr Refshauge, getting up and criticising Mr Brereton. He was demanding that the east-west runway be re-opened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The east-west runway has been shut simply for a political reason, as Senator Collins knows. It is not a safety measure. The CAA, the FAC and all those people know that it is not a safety measure. If it is a safety measure today, why was it not a safety measure six weeks ago when we had the main runway and the cross runway operating at the same time and when the throughput of aeroplanes was substantially higher? This thing has been brought on before the new control tower is in place. It has been brought on for political reasons. Everyone at that meeting knew that there had been a shift of noise from Laurie Brereton's electorate to the electorates north of Kingsford Smith airport. </PARA>

Even a kindergarten student would know perfectly well that the situation with intersecting runways and simultaneous operations where two aircraft are approaching each other is exacerbated when there are two runways that intersect, not one. It is safer&mdash;and Senator Parer knows it&mdash;to operate the two parallel runways without simultaneous operations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last night in Senate estimates, Mr Buck Brooksbank, who is in charge of air traffic control in the CAA, and has been for many years, confirmed that it was his advice, as the officer in charge of air traffic control, that determined that the east-west runway would not be used on operational and safety grounds&mdash;not Mr Brereton. That was explicitly laid out. In fact, the CAA issued a press statement today confirming the advice that it gave last night. The press statement says this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Civil Aviation Authority today reaffirmed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>it puts the lie to what Senator Baume and Senator Parer have just said; it destroys the political case they are trying to make&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">its position that on safety grounds it strongly advises against the use of the east west runway in intersecting operations with the parallel north south runway system. The position is based on the following considerations: it has been accepted internationally that parallel runway operations are an improvement in safety over intersecting operations. More complex three runway configuration operations would increase work load and complexity for both air traffic controllers and pilots with conflicting traffic patterns both on the ground and in the air.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fact. The statement continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A large number of aircraft would need to cross the active east west runway to position for take-off on the parallel runways or taxi into the terminals after landing. It is estimated that aircraft would be expected to cross the east west runway every 45 seconds or less. With the use of any intersecting east west runway the required safety corridors to accommodate aircraft carrying out missed approaches could not be readily provided.</PARA>
<PARA>That is confirmation, again on the public record, of what was delivered, which gives the absolute lie to the case being made by Senator Parer.

<PARA>My question related to remarks made last night by Bernie Fraser, the Governor of the Reserve Bank. This is a matter of great significance because we all know the circumstances in which Mr Fraser was appointed to that job. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) thought he had him in his pocket; in other words, that the Reserve Bank would do the government's bidding, and by and large it has. Indeed, I have no doubt at all that Mr Fraser would not be immune from the same telephonic blowtorch that the Prime Minister brings to bear on anyone who might even think of stepping out of line. That is why it is highly significant that what we got last night was a devastating indictment of government economic policy in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One only just has to look at some of the things that Mr Fraser said to realise the extent to which he has totally lost confidence in this government's ability to govern: Australia's performance relative to APEC nations is poor, both in terms of productivity and in terms of growth; current wage demands are excessive; the current account deficit is excessive; and the ABS figures show that Australia's current account deficit was the largest ever recorded in a September quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fraser is not a fool; he knows very well what this government is about. It has been given all the right advice. It has been told that it ought to cut government expenditure. Indeed, Mr Fraser prefers to put it in terms of raising taxation revenue. But the end result is the same because he is saying it is simply not sustainable to have the level of current account deficit that we have at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Fraser pointed out that the Australian economy is currently growing at an annual rate of five to six per cent, which cannot be sustained without generating higher inflation and imports. That is why he said interest rates have already risen by 1.75 percentage points in recent times. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On-going current account deficits of 5 or 6 per cent of GDP would not be conducive to improving our external debt position. In fact, they would worsen it, increasing our vulnerability to the vagaries of sentiment in international financial markets&mdash;something which many people already find unsettling when it starts to go against Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the message we were getting from Mr Keating back in 1986 when he said that if we continued to run a current account deficit of $12 billion a year we would turn into a banana republic. That was seven years ago. Now we have a situation that is much worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I think Mr Fraser's remarks demonstrate beyond doubt that the Prime Minister is not only the greatest economic failure that this country has ever had but also the greatest policy fraud. Time and again he is prepared to make grand statements which he has no intention of delivering&mdash;for example, the l-a-w tax cuts which are currently postponed will clearly never see the light of day. Indeed, if this government ever got another chance to bring down a budget and it were to act responsibly, we would see taxes going in the opposite direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Fraser was saying in blunt terms was that this country has run out of credits, that what the Prime Minister said seven years ago about Australia becoming a banana republic is even more true today. That is why I want to mention in passing the disgraceful attempt on the part of the government to distract attention from Mr Fraser's blowtorch and somehow suggest that Peter Costello, the shadow Treasurer, had indicated the need to, and, indeed, was pledging that the coalition would, cut government expenditure by $14.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Mr Costello did instead say was that Australia needed to cut back on its levels of expenditure, and he went out of his way to demonstrate that this was an urgent necessity and to make it clear that he was not proposing to cut the budget by 14, 41 or any other figure. Once again that was simply a desperate attempt on the part of the government to distract attention from its own policy bankruptcy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I think it all means is this: after seven years and one of the most painful recessions in Australia's history with more than 800,000 people out of work, with youth unemployment still around 27 per cent, the Labor government, under the stewardship of Mr Keating, has fundamentally failed to achieve the necessary restructuring to allow us to grow at a sustainable rate. We are simply back on the treadmill. We are looking at a boom-bust outcome. We have achieved nothing for all that agony and all that suffering that many hundreds of thousands of Australians are going through all because the vanity of the Prime Minister will not allow him to take the necessary tough decisions. This bloke is a wimp. He is not interested in tough decisions. He is interested in posturing to the media, but he is certainly not interested in the national welfare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to take note of Senator Evans's answer. Australia, under the economic stewardship of the Keating Labor government, is now in an historically dangerous fiscal position.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in the past couple of years read the disastrous outcomes of some of the Reaganomics years, particularly as told by David Stockman, the budget office director in the Reagan administration. When I heard what Mr Fraser reported late last night and then heard the government's defence here in the Senate today it reminded me of some of the warnings that David Stockman made to the Republican Party and to the Reagan presidency during those years of that presidency and the lunatic tax cutting without spending cutting that created some of the horrendous deficits that the Reagan era produced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see in Australia Bernie Fraser advising Mr Keating, the Prime Minister, advising the Keating Cabinet that what they are doing is going down a lunatic economic path which, in the end, will destroy the lives of hundreds of thousands of Australians. We have already seen in the past two months interest rate increases which are already stopping young Australians getting jobs. Small business is the big job creator in this economy, to take it right back to where it counts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are hundreds of thousands of young Australians who have never had a job and many more who have been unemployed for extremely long periods. Many of those do not have roofs over their heads. Many of those live and sleep on the streets. I met some of them in a park in Fremantle on Sunday afternoon&mdash;young kids coming up and begging; no jobs, no hope. Many of the friends of those young people are turning to suicide as the solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all comes back to the economic management of Mr Keating, who is ignoring all of the warnings that have gone on in developed economies in the free world for generation after generation. What he and Senator Gareth Evans are pretending is happening is what David Stockman called the magic astrix&mdash;the sort of future spending cuts that no-one could ever say where they would be made. Former Senator Peter Walsh has used the term `magic astrix' as well to talk about the deficit reduction plan that this government says it has put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, what Mr Keating and Senator Evans by agreeing with him are saying is that they believe in magic astrixes. They blame the Greens for believing in magic puddings but these guys, by ignoring Mr Fraser's very sensible warnings about the horrendous shape of the Australian economy and the effects that it will have on future generations, are saying that they believe in the magic astrix. The magic astrix is a lot more dangerous than the magic pudding, because the magic pudding will never be government policy; the magic astrix is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that Mr Keating believes in is a lady called Rosie Scenario, who David Stockman described in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Triumph of Politics</EMPHASIS>. What Rosie Scenario said, translated into Australian, is that the budget will whirr back into surplus. `Whirr back into surplus,' I think were Mr Keating's words a few years ago. The book stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Rosie Scenario, the old 1970s tax and spending policy, would have projected out over five years to produce an unprecedented surplus.</PARA>
<PARA>It is the same concept. </PARA>

<PARA>The answer was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rosie Scenario, why she was an economic heart throb. Touch her hand to the deficit ridden federal budget and the surpluses never stop.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what Mr Keating believes the federal budget will do without any action on spending and without any action on tax. That is what he asked the people of Australia to believe. We know that it is unbelievable; Mr Fraser knows that it is unbelievable. But the saddest thing about this is that the people who will be affected by this deception are young people, probably in school at the moment, who will not have jobs when they get out of school. Small businesses will not be able to employ them, nor will big businesses, because this country is moving down what the prime minister himself called `the road to the banana republic,' only a few years ago. He is now trying to turn this nation into a republic but he has also taken us down that road to economic ruin. We are having warnings every day from Mr Fraser and they are being ignored.

We knew then that we were living in a dynamic era, but the nature and the pace of the changes which have since taken place were quite unforeseeable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of all the changes, the most significant has been the collapse of the Soviet Union. This was a massively important event, which fundamentally changed the global security environment. Almost overnight, the east-west stand-off, which dominated international strategic affairs for 50 years, was no more. No part of the globe was unaffected by this radical change&mdash;certainly not Asia and the Pacific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This historic geo-strategic change has been accompanied in the Asia-Pacific region by continued and rapid economic growth. Potentially, this too has enormous long-term consequences for strategic relationships and security in the region. The government's 1994 defence white paper&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS>&mdash;addresses the long-term consequences of these major changes for our defence policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS> looks ahead 15 years to provide broad guidance for defence policy making and for the force structure and capability decisions we will have to make. It provides the framework for developing our defence policy through the next decade. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS> is a substantial and complex document. Today I will simply highlight some of the underlying thinking and key themes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our starting point is the conviction that Australia must maintain the capability to defend itself against armed attack. Despite all the hopes and aspirations we share for reducing the chances of conflict since the end of the Cold War, military force is still an important element in international affairs, and will remain so. That is a fact of life&mdash;regrettably&mdash;but a fact nevertheless. It is also a fact that, while we will do all we can to avoid the use of force ourselves, ultimately, armed force can only be resisted by armed force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must therefore continue to be sure that we can defeat an armed attack on our territory. We have a continent of our own to defend, and a unique set of national interests. We must be self-reliant, with the capabilities to provide for our defence without relying on the combat forces of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key judgment in this white paper is that fundamental changes in strategic affairs, both globally and within our region, will make Australia's strategic environment more demanding over the next 15 years. The threat of global war has all but disappeared, but so has the predictable shape which the Cold War imposed on strategic affairs throughout Asia and the Pacific. In its place, a new, more fluid and more complex strategic pattern will emerge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Security in the region will be shaped by continued high levels of economic growth. The sustained expansion in the economies of most countries is bringing enormous social and economic benefits. It is also increasing the capacity of many countries to modernise and develop their armed forces, and to become more confident and self-reliant in their security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The military capabilities of our regional neighbours are improving, especially through the introduction of higher technology systems. We will also see a growing capacity to sustain and operate these systems. Australia looks to the future of this region with confidence, and with a strong awareness of the opportunities which Asia offers for our own future. In looking to our long-term security, we will take a positive approach to the region, and to the international defence policies and relationships which support our defence interests. Nevertheless, prudence requires that we maintain the capabilities to ensure our defence self-reliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's defence policy, as spelt out in this white paper, recognises our responsibility to help shape our security environment. This requires that we engage closely with our region on strategic issues; that we maintain our alliances with the United States and New Zealand; and that we contribute effectively to multinational security efforts. Just as Australia's prosperity is strengthened by our economic integration with Asia, so our security will be enhanced by closer strategic engagement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has an active role to play in the evolution of a secure regional environment which reflects our needs and interests, and makes armed attack on this country less likely. The way we seek to influence this environment will need to evolve as strategic circumstances change. The task will become more challenging as our security environment becomes more complex and more demanding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will strengthen our bilateral defence relationships, and actively pursue multilateral approaches to security in the region. In particular, we will foster an accurate understanding of Australia's strategic interests and security concerns. In turn, we will ensure that we understand the perceptions, concerns and capabilities of our neighbours. At the same time, our alliance with the United States will continue to be a key element of our defence policy. We will work with the United States to ensure that the alliance continues to meet the needs of both parties&mdash;both in a strategic sense, and in the practical benefits it delivers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to give strong support to United Nations and other multinational endeavours which promote global security. An effective United Nations can help to make war less likely throughout the world by mobilising international action against aggression. Our support for the United Nations therefore makes a direct contribution to our security. It is also through the United Nations machinery that the government is able to respond effectively to humanitarian crises, such as those in Rwanda and Somalia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Important as these commitments are, we do not structure the Australian Defence Force for them. The ADF has clearly demonstrated that its force structure and readiness levels are sufficient to undertake United Nations tasks&mdash;provided the defence budget is supplemented for major contributions. We will continue to examine each multinational operation on its merits, and evaluate each contribution in terms of our national objectives. Effective arms control measures also contribute directly to Australia's security. Therefore, defence will continue to support the government's policy objectives in relation to global regimes for arms control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also strongly committed to transparency in defence planning in order to build trust and reduce suspicion&mdash;especially within our own region. The publication of this white paper is, itself, an important trust-building measure. While the government will continue its active pursuit of Australia's international defence interests in these ways, the key message of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS> is that our highest defence priority will continue to be to build, maintain and support forces which ensure we can defeat any armed attack against Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not believe that any country has an intention to use force against Australia. We have no disputes with other countries which might be expected to give rise to the use of force, and there is also no reason to expect one to develop. However, disputes can arise, and intentions can change relatively quickly. Because military capabilities take many years to develop, it follows that we plan on the basis of capabilities, not threats. Let me repeat: we plan on the basis of capabilities, not threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No country has the capability to seize and hold major territory on our continent. Significantly, we believe that no country plans to develop such forces. To do so would require a very large effort, and we would expect to have substantial warning of any such development. However, the capabilities available to mount lesser levels of attack on Australia will grow over the next 15 years. Such attacks could be very damaging to Australia, and could arise with relatively little warning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key challenge for defence capability planning will be to adapt to the greater demands posed by increasing military capabilities in such short-warning conflict. We will continue to use the most cost-effective means to ensure our security. Our planning will exploit Australia's geographic advantages, technological capabilities, and our wider national resources to ensure we can defend this country. This means giving clear priority to the naval and air capabilities needed to deny our approaches to an adversary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must recognise, however, that the development of military technology poses new challenges. Over the longer term we will need to be more selective about those military capabilities in which we must maintain our technological advantage. We will also use our defence capabilities more efficiently. All elements of the Australian Defence Force will work closely together as an integrated force, and make the best possible use of their equipment and facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our ability to draw on wider national resources will grow in importance. We will seek to integrate a range of civil assets and expertise into our defence effort in order to sustain our capabilities more efficiently. This will provide a wider base for developing and supporting high-technology systems. The effective use of our geographical and technological advantages, backed by the diverse strengths of our national support base, will give Australia a defence posture of greater depth and resilience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From this key objective flows the main defence priorities set out in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS>. I want to highlight three today. Firstly, high priority will be given to the skilled people we need in the ADF. The Australian Defence Force's tradition of excellence is based on the professionalism of its people. Our deployments to the Gulf War, Namibia, Cambodia, Somalia, Rwanda and elsewhere have demonstrated this beyond question. We should also acknowledge the great body of unsung work which our forces do every day to ensure they retain the necessary levels of proficiency and preparedness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ADF will remain fundamentally dependent on the quality of its people. It is easy to overlook some of the special demands military life places on our people and their families. We must therefore ensure that they receive adequate recognition. While personnel numbers will not increase over the next 15 years, the demands placed on our people by new technology will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recruiting and retaining high-calibre people in the defence force presents long-term challenges. Over time, we will increase community understanding of defence, and encourage greater recognition of the career opportunities that military service provides. In addition, a wide-ranging defence review of the principles which underpin ADF personnel policies and procedures has begun, and will be completed next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reserves, too, have a long and proud tradition of service in peace and war. The white paper makes clear that reserves now have specific roles in our operational elements. They form a fundamental part of our total force and provide important links between the defence force and the wider community. Changes in reserve training are being implemented, and a detailed structural review of the army reserve will be carried out next year. This will ensure that our reserves are better equipped and that their training standards are more closely aligned to those of regular members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the government will emphasise investment in high-technology capabilities which increase our security. We are moving ahead with plans to procure airborne early warning and control aircraft, and we will replace the Macchi lead-in fighters and our ageing transport aircraft. We will also proceed with new command, control, communications and intelligence networks, new helicopters for our ANZAC frigates, new minehunters, and new vehicles for the land force. Our six new Collins class submarines, due to come on line in the next few years, will be the most capable conventional boats in the world. They are sufficient to meet our forecast needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will, however, review the need for additional submarines in the context of the first five-year defence budget in 1996-97. Our existing Leopard tank fleet will meet our needs until at least 2010. Therefore, we will not take up the recent offer to purchase newer Leopard tanks because this would not be cost effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence capability development is not just based on acquiring new equipment. In a number of cases, we have the opportunity to enhance our capabilities by upgrading existing equipment and systems. For instance, we will ensure that our FA18 Hornet fighter aircraft remain highly effective well into the next century by upgrading their sensors, electronic countermeasures and weapons. We will also undertake major upgrades of Australia's FFG frigates, M113 tracked armoured vehicles, and P3C maritime patrol aircraft. In our land force, the scope of efficiencies programmed by army will free up the personnel and resources necessary to raise a fifth infantry battalion. This battalion will be formed over the next three to four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the government will continue to pursue a more effective partnership between defence and Australian industry. This is essential to strengthen defence self-reliance over the long term. We look to internationally competitive industries in Australia and New Zealand to supply, maintain and adapt our high-technology defence equipment. We also look to industry to design and manufacture equipment suited to our unique needs. To encourage and assist our industries to develop the capabilities defence needs, we have identified a number of changes to the way defence works with industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence will rely more on the strengths of the commercial sector. We will identify further opportunities for the commercial support program and help industry to acquire more defence-related intellectual property. In addition, we will encourage greater local industrial research and development and, within carefully enforced guidelines, encourage increased international material cooperation and defence exports. Our emphasis on a strong partnership with industry will be complemented by the efficient use of Australian defence science and technology to help develop and support our most important defence capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More broadly, successful national defence requires the closest possible links between defence and the wider Australian community. This partnership ensures that vital support is available for our defence in peace and in conflict. It also provides major benefits to the Australian community through the ADF's activities in such areas as disaster relief, bushfire fighting, search and rescue, and counter-terrorist support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I address the issue of resources. National defence can never be done `on the cheap'. More complex and demanding strategic circumstances will place even greater pressure on our defence budget. We cannot escape that. It is often assumed that, by reducing uniformed personnel numbers, we reduce our defence capabilities. This is not the case. Defence has recently achieved major reforms which have reduced personnel numbers and costs significantly, without reducing capabilities. Personnel costs have dropped from 60 per cent of the defence budget 20 years ago to under 40 per cent today. The government will continue to seek defence reforms and efficiencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, we recognise that these savings cannot accommodate all the additional pressures on the defence budget over coming years. Those pressures will arise from the need to meet higher labour costs as ADF skill requirements rise and to sustain the operations needed to keep our capabilities highly effective. At the same time, we must invest in major new equipment and facilities because continual development is essential to maintain our relative level of capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is determined to sustain defence funding. A long-term commitment is fundamental when capabilities take decades to develop and introduce. We will provide the stability and predictability which is so important to the development and management of long-term projects and activities. For the next few years defence expenditure at current programmed levels will enable the plans and projects outlined in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS> to proceed. Beyond that, modest real increases will be needed to meet the demands of an increasingly complex defence environment. The government has considered these issues carefully and responsibly, and is committed to sustaining defence spending at approximately two per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also decided that, from 1996-97, it will provide defence with a five-year budget commitment. This is a historic commitment. It is a decision which will provide an assured basis for long-term planning. This will allow more efficient development of defence capabilities, more effective procurement from industry, and better personnel planning and management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many areas in Australia contribute to our defence objectives. Defence, in turn, contributes to other national objectives. This includes Australia's international security interests, which require very close integration of government policies and approaches. The relationship between the departments of Defence, Prime Minister and Cabinet and Foreign Affairs in these areas is especially strong, and contrasts markedly with the approach of some 10 years ago. Our commitment to this integrated approach was reflected in the close consultation which occurred during preparation of this white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decisions we make on crucial resource and other issues over the next few years will shape Australia's defences well into the next century. The government is determined that, in the coming decades, our adaptable, versatile and self-reliant defence effort will effectively safeguard our country. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding on behalf of the coalition to the defence white paper of 1994, it is probably fair to say that the paper is intended to give us more of the warm fuzzy glow that we have had served up to us in earlier Labor defence policy statements. But Australians should not be deceived. The government tells us that defence cannot be done on the cheap&mdash;and the minister is quite right: it certainly cannot be done on the smell of an oily rag&mdash;and the government continues to argue that it is committed to defence self-reliance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am disappointed that in this document the government fails to credibly address the central issue of how it will fund the defence of Australia. Instead of a real commitment to self-reliance, the white paper is full of promises to examine future ADF capabilities. Perhaps the government is colour-blind&mdash;I thought maybe this was a green paper, not a white paper. Australians should understand that many of the announcements are not new; and of the rest, they are merely promises to investigate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time available to me just before this debate, I made a quick collection of some of the matters which are `under consideration': military satellites, to be examined; unmanned aerial vehicles, to be examined; fixed seabed acoustic arrays, to be examined; AWACS, closer but still to be examined; Land Force, to be examined; the ready reserves, to be examined; the call out protection, to be examined; and the two Collins class submarines, while off the agenda for the moment, are to be re-examined in 1996-97. It is for that reason I say&mdash;and I think with some force&mdash;that this is a white paper that should have been a green paper. These were matters to be examined; these were matters for consideration. The only clear unequivocal commitments&mdash;and we hope that they are unequivocal&mdash;are those that have already been announced over the last few years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My following observations regarding today's white paper are made, sadly, in the light of the government's track record with its last defence white paper in 1987 and the strategic review in 1993. Because we are so used to rhetoric and promises that do not come true, it is inevitable that we are sceptical about anything that is written in this white paper. It is perhaps unkind to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray), but it is a fact of life: we will believe him when we see it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a mere two hours to assess this paper, and I thank the minister for the courtesy of that much. But it has taken the government seven years to write it, and that is a long time and I would have expected more from it. It is long overdue. I will have more to say about this in the next few days, and my initial responses are inevitably pretty brief. I would like to have been able to go into it in more depth for this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me talk, first of all, about defence policy. While the white paper continues to argue for defence self-reliance, trying to engender a sort of visionary sentiment and warm fuzzy glow, we do not know how the government will really fund it because the current trend is towards zero or negative real growth in defence budgets&mdash;and I will talk about the budget issues later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, does Mr Keating's call for self-reliance, which he made in a recent speech, mean that he does not intend to draw upon US military resources to fill the shortfall in our defence capabilities? Is that alliance really off, in practical terms? In one paragraph in the white paper it is mentioned that we still value it&mdash;but that is buried fairly deeply and does not go into any detail or emphasis. So I am just wondering whether Mr Keating is thinking he can go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the government of the comments about bludging which were made back in August by the head of the New Zealand defence force. He was talking there about New Zealand, but the same holds good for Australia in trying to be self-reliant. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any move to abandon the defence relationship with Australia would have repercussions far beyond defence. The Australians would rightly see us as pushing the cost of our security onto them, to be bludging on their defence taxes. Retaliation in the areas of trade, investment, immigration and travel would almost inevitably follow.</PARA>
<PARA>So it is an argument for us to try to achieve self-reliance, but it is not an argument for us to mislead our people and suggest that we truly can be totally self-reliant. There is a tiny little bit in what the minister says about self-reliance in terms of combat forces, but that is a very little bit, as he knows, and it is not true anyway on today's personnel and force structure. We badly need an increase in our combat forces, but I do not see us moving very far in that direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people argue for self-reliance, they have to pay for it. It comes at a cost. In previous wars we have relied on our great and powerful friends for our logistic support. We now have to provide that for ourselves if we are really going to talk about being self-reliant, and that means more people, skills and equipment. So the government should at least be honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">1987</EMPHASIS>, the government argued for defence in depth&mdash;the coordinated application of the full range of defence capabilities and that that would be Australia's defence strategy. In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> the government went further, and it started to talk about taking control of the air-sea gap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Control is a very specific military term. Therefore, in quite a few ways, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SR 1993</EMPHASIS> was a change in direction. Control requires a far greater level of military capability than denial. I wonder whether the government has given much thought to what our neighbours think about the strategy of control of the air-sea gap. I would not think they would be too happy. They have exclusive economic zones which come into our air-sea gap, and I would have thought that they would have had an interest in what we were trying to do in that area. No doubt the government's investigation of the possibility of fixed seabed acoustic arrays will also impress our neighbours, just at the time when we are trying to seek greater regional trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">DOA 1987</EMPHASIS>, Labor argued for a defence strategy to meet credible levels of threat in Australia's area of direct military interest. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Strategic Review 1993</EMPHASIS> also argued for strategic engagement with the region. That is all very interesting because we are now being told how very quickly threats can build up in our region. The white paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . hostile motives and intentions can develop much more quickly than military capabilities can be built up.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say, at this stage:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no country is currently acquiring the range and scale of forces necessary for an operation of this magnitude.</PARA>
<PARA>The white paper goes on to talk about uncertainties after the end of the Cold War&mdash;and it took a long time to notice that it had happened. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we acknowledge the possibility that our security environment could deteriorate, perhaps quite seriously in the future. We recognise that at some time in the future armed force could be used against us and that we need to be prepared to meet it. </PARA>
<PARA>It is fantastic to see that at last there is a bit of honesty. That is a major statement which people should at least address their attention to. It goes on to make the necessary conclusion that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to do that, Australia must develop and maintain adequate forces today. A military force that has been neglected in peace cannot be revived quickly when a threat emerges. The military capabilities required to defend Australia must be sustained continuously if they are to be available and effective when they are needed because the necessary technologies and skills</PARA>
<PARA>&mdash;and I emphasise `skills' because they are people things&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">take a long time to develop.</PARA>
<PARA>People may sometimes think that some government documents are written by two different arms of government, because the piece that I just quoted tells us what it really is all about. But when we come to the budgetary considerations, it looks as if that comes from somebody who lives in cloud-cuckoo-land. It is certainly not part of the group that wrote that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the strategic engagement with our region that we are talking about, the government has recommended sharing training with our neighbours. Of course, the coalition supports this. The coalition was there long before the government. I draw the attention of honourable senators to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Strong Australia</EMPHASIS>, which was our very detailed policy document brought out in 1992. We spelt out very clearly our support for cooperative regional defence arrangements, but strategic engagement means an increase in training and training costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How is that extra and costly training obligation going to be met under this white paper when even now, under the current situation without the extra engagement with our regional neighbours that the government is talking about, the Royal Australian Navy cannot achieve the planned days at sea, which it has been given as a task to meet? It achieved less than 90 per cent of the planned days at sea in 1993-94. That means that one day in every 10 planned days of training at sea was slashed. So much for being able to expand and be in strategic engagement with our neighbours. Those training exercises will be even more costly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two services have also not met their targeted training levels, according to the 1993-94 defence report. We do not hear any mention of that from the minister. There is no reference to that in the white paper. The CDF, the Chief of the Defence Force, has a readiness directive for each unit in the Australian Defence Force. The readiness of each of our units is secret, but by careful reading of the defence annual report we can see that at the very least training levels have not been met. From that we must deduce that readiness targets were not met as well, and we should all be extremely concerned because we get a piece in the white paper that says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . existing infantry readiness levels are now considered broadly sufficient for the defence of Australia&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>mind you they make a proviso&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in our present circumstances. The exception to this could be in the period of any conflict prior to call-out and preparation of the Reserve, when considerable demands would be placed on our four Regular battalions to protect important assets . . . The availability of a fifth infantry battalion would greatly enhance our capacity . . .</PARA>
<PARA>So it would, but I will have more to say about that later because that battalion, while it is now something under consideration I am glad to see, is going to be raised over the next three to four years only as the resources become available. It is one more thing on the never-never. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just briefly mention the peacekeeping role because the minister made a claim in his statement, which I do not think accords terribly well with what we actually have in the white paper. The briefing that we in the opposition have had about peacekeeping is that it is critically important that our force structure should not be distorted by the demands of peacekeeping, that we should so fashion our force that it is for the defence of Australia and Australia's interests, and peacekeeping in a sense is an incidental activity. It comes down the list and it should not distort our force structure. The minister said as much in his statement this afternoon in the Senate, but I see here in black and white in the white paper that we are meant to believe the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If situations arose where the Force lacked the specific characteristics to provide adequate options, we would consider some marginal variations to force structure.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the foot in the door. The white paper says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The justification for this would be examined on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>
<PARA>When the government wants to do this down the track, it will point to this in the white paper and say, `See, we flagged it with you.' Well, let succeeding generations note that the minister said otherwise at the same time he was tabling the statement. I am not too impressed with that double speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the question of the defence budget. The assumption is that growth in the economy will be sufficient to fund a real increase in defence outlays. There we face two problems, because continuous economic growth is unlikely. The normal functioning of the business cycle will ensure a downturn in two to three years at the most, if not before. Certainly, if the government's fiscal policy proves ill-judged, as we believe it will, it may well be sooner and more severe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's fiscal strategies do not mirror the path of economic growth, anyway. In general, to sustain economic growth, government expenditures should be reduced before growth peaks. Where government countercyclical expenditure is required&mdash;that is, where increased expenditure is needed to kickstart the economy&mdash;its focus is usually on short-term expenditures and not on defence. For those reasons, it is unlikely that national economic growth will provide the level of increase in defence outlay required to permit funding of the equipment bulge that we all know is coming&mdash;it is acknowledged&mdash;in about 2010. The defence budget will probably be in serious trouble before then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The financial policy aspects of the 1994 white paper of diverting real growth to equipment at about 20 per cent of expenditure and restraining expenditure on personnel to around 40 per cent of the expenditure, as we heard the minister say earlier, are much the same as those for the 1976 white paper; and that planned 23 per cent expenditure on equipment and 44.5 per cent expenditure on personnel by the year 1980-81. But the 1976 white paper objectives were not reached because of economic problems. The government should at least learn from that experience. The big economic problem that that government faced was wage inflation. We all know only too well the threats that are on our economic horizon right now with the increased wage demands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1976 white paper failed because of economic problems, particularly wage inflation. Let this government be warned: it cannot predicate extra expenditure for defence at all based on economic growth. Any wage inflation pressures which are under way at the moment, generated by the government's current wages policy, could have a significant bearing on the success of this 1994 white paper. It is also wise, therefore, for the white paper to assume that most efficiency savings, if any, will be absorbed in increased remuneration for Defence Force personnel and civilians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to briefly mention defence industry. I wonder whether the government believes that Australia can, through substantial defence exports, be a defence industry support base for the South-East Asian region, as it claimed in the strategic review 1993. The interesting thing, which the government does not seem to want to talk about, is that defence exports are only about $16 million per annum. I draw the Senate's attention to how that figure is calculated. Australia's total annual exports of controlled defence products is some $90 million. Of that, less than 10 per cent goes to South-East Asia. Of what we are actually selling, about one-third of our defence exports are comprised of sporting firearms and ammunition, having little to do with defence industry, another $28 million resulted from offsets activities, and $15 million from the defence cooperation program. That left something like $17 million of real exports. That information came from the chairman's address to the defence export outlook conference in 1993. Yet, once again, we hear the rhetoric about defence exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem was that in 1986 Mr Cooksey estimated that Australia could have defence exports of $500 million by the early 1990s. The defence export policy has to be described as yet another government failure, but the Labor Party persists with the hope of making Australia a defence industry support base, despite the current climate in our region and elsewhere of an arms bazaar and the difficulties that Australia has with its costs of getting a toehold. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I now turn to defence personnel. I cannot help wondering where the government now stands on the force structure review. We have had 3 1/2 years of reduced manning levels throughout the services. I cannot believe that it can continue with the levels that are causing real worries over training and safety in the Australian Defence Force. For example, army troops have not been receiving adequate training in the use of the Steyr rifles. The report in the army's own newspaper in July last year said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Everyone was happy with the training. However, the instructors trained by the SARP team were often not given sufficient time in their units to conduct a complete conversion course," Captain Grant said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The unit training, in a lot of cases, was deficient. The instructors had one day, two days or a couple of half days over a month period and no time for continuation training."</PARA>
<PARA>That goes also to the problem that some units have had with shortage of ammunition. Last week's decision to dramatically increase the recruiting numbers in the Defence Force was an admission that the personnel ceiling management had failed. The government should have foreseen that a combination of the force structure review policies and the economic upturn would strip the ADF personnel numbers to minimum levels. Perhaps the government thought that the `recession we had to have' would never end. Many of us think it has not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The force structure review has caused serious problems for the defence forces. The personnel numbers in the combat units are inadequate. The logistics numbers also need maintaining if we are aiming for self-reliance. As I said earlier, our great and powerful friends supplied our logistics in the main to us in the past. It takes people to maintain troops in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the CSP program. That is still being supported in its current form, despite the fact that large numbers of service people are getting out because their career advancements are being reduced. We have these hearts and strings paragraphs in the white paper about how important defence families are and how personnel are the lifeblood of the defence of Australia. That is true. The Chief of the Defence Force, Admiral Beaumont, is reported as having talked about morale being:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . `patchy', although generally good at operational bases, while the attitude in support bases (those people being subjected to the greatest change under programs such as commercial support&mdash;CSP) was `less good' . . . many people were put out of their "comfort" zones . . . many were feeling `less secure'.</PARA>
<PARA>We should all be concerned about that. If the Senate does not believe the CDF about the lack of morale, I suggest it cops this. I refer to an item from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">North-West News</EMPHASIS>, a newspaper circulated in Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA>It is a disgrace. Our fighting men and women now have to rely on charity. Many of their families are eligible for welfare, to their great and understandable disgust. The government's policies have also cut seriously into the preparedness and expertise base of the ADF. Is the government planning to continue its decade-plus tradition of high equipment funding at the expense of personnel numbers and their training? It seems so from this white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the current size of the defence budget pie and the need to improve service conditions to attract new personnel, an inevitable blow-out in training costs to deal with the influx of recruits is coming. How will the government meet its personnel obligations? Will we have more of those 1930s style battalions that went into history as Dad's Army? Do honourable senators think we will have enough money left to afford the broomsticks so they can train?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are setting up a fifth battalion, which is badly needed. I understand that will be achieved by splitting two battalions which are already grossly undermanned. I have here figures showing that the battalion in Townsville, which is meant to have 703 people, has 675 people. The 2nd/4th Battalion, which is the one believed to be splitting, is nominally 689 people. It is now down to 526. The 3rd Battalion at Holsworthy is meant to be 623. It is down to 557. The 5th/7th Battalion is nominally operational at 740 and is nominally 639, yet it has 480. That is the reality of Australia's defence and how self-reliant we can be, yet we are splitting a battalion that is already grossly undermanned to make two new ones, which will be even more grossly undermanned. So what will we end up with? Four grossly undermanned battalions in lieu of the three grossly undermanned ones we have now. Even then, it is not planned that that will start for several years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister says the first defence priority highlighted is the increased need for skilled people. But the white paper comes at a time when, with a recession coming to an end, there are worrying signs of a wastage crisis like the one we had in the 1980s as separation rates, especially amongst skilled personnel, begin to creep up. How does the minister plan to, first of all, retain existing skilled personnel against outside competition, because that will be costly, and, secondly, recruit new skilled personnel without significant financial inducements, as page 12 of the minister's statement says that for the next few years defence expenditure will continue at the current programmed levels?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not have much time today to go into the other issues that I would like to except to mention that the ready reserve continues to have real problems. What is the government going to do about that? It is going to have a review. It is having a review, just like it is having a review of everything else in this paper. It was the government's idea. It proved, as we told the government at the time, to be a lot more costly than it said, and it is still not going to improve our readiness levels and our capability. Problems still surround the government's commitment to people in the ready reserve, just as they still surround its commitment to the reserves. I notice that, once again, the general reserves are to be reviewed. I say to the general reserves: `Look out. Here comes the government with another knife.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is inevitable that, with 20 per cent wastage in the general reserves, the reasons for people&mdash;reserves or regulars&mdash;leaving the defence forces will have to be looked at. But that review, I believe, will be looking at more than just reasons for wastage. I think it is positive that the government has recognised the need for better conditions of service for the general reserve. But, in conclusion, I have to say that I am disappointed with this white paper. The government promised to protect Australians from the threat or use of armed force, but despite its rhetoric about commitment, in practice it has shown no sign of being prepared to pay the cost of such protection. </PARA>

Hardly anything in it is new and nothing in it has not been foretold to anyone who has been following the defence debate in Australia. It is disappointing because, in essence, it prescribes a further run-down in Australia's meagre defence capabilities. Admittedly, the paper is attractively presented. It has a good layout and good chapter headings and is full of motherhood statements and purple prose. But it is utterly without any substance with respect to the defence of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It maintains the general approach of this government because it reaches back philosophically to the Dibb 1986 paper. It re-runs all the old discredited dogma of the sea-air gap and low-level contingencies and relates it to the eternal geographic fact that Australia is an island and therefore that is the basic determinant of Australia's defence. We are back to the old business of no threat for 15 years, which first surfaced during the Whitlam years, the old dogma of the adequate warning time&mdash;the time we have to prepare if we have an emergency&mdash;and all those other things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole basis of this government's approach is to write strategic reviews which show there is no threat and the strategic reviews and the white paper then justify inadequate expenditure on defence. Yet this government admits that things have changed dramatically since the last white paper in 1987. That is certainly true&mdash;there has been the ending of the Cold War and the great changes in the Asian economies which have produced very significant changes in our environment which have a great relevance to Australia's defence. But nothing flows from that in this paper, even in the name of the paper. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia</EMPHASIS> was the previous white paper in 1987. This one is known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS>. There is such a lack of positiveness in that. The change between the titles of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia</EMPHASIS> to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia</EMPHASIS> reflects the lack of commitment of this government to what we have before us today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The previous paper in 1987, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia</EMPHASIS>, gave us an unbalanced defence force. It gave us a totally inadequate land force with four understrength infantry battalions structured for the mythical low-level contingencies. It gave us a huge investment in naval hardware, and it neglected the army and the air force. So, in effect, it gave us this unbalanced force structure. What Australia needs is a balanced, flexible, modern force. But, to the government, flexibility means that we can take an army unit and send it on peacekeeping ventures. That is not the purpose of flexibility at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report has a few proposals of merit in it. The most important of those is the provision of an AWACS capability. I will believe that when we see it, because parliaments in this country have been talking about acquiring an AWACS capability ever since I came into parliament 16 years ago. Nothing can overemphasise the importance of an AWACS capability, given our present inadequacies. It is important to all three services, particularly the navy. But all we have had from this government is endless evasion. It has never signed up and got its feet on the ladder to provide anything. We have always been told that new developments are around the corner and that, if we wait a little while, something better will come along. That is certainly true of all technical advances, but the fact of the matter is that AWACS has been around since 1943, which is over 50 years ago, and we still do not have one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal that we look at satellite communications for military purposes is very important. The proposal that we resurrect another infantry battalion is important, but it will go less than halfway towards solving the problems of the army. There are a number of misleading statements in the document. The implication on page 46 that Rapier will become obsolescent by the year 2000 implies that the Rapier defence system is adequate at the present time. Nothing could be further from the truth. It is woefully out of date. It is the mark I version that has never been modified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reference to the F111 and F18 strike capability in all weather is not true; it is only true if they are operating against undefended targets. The intention to retain adequate self-protection capabilities is mentioned in paragraph 5.66 of the report. The fact of the matter is that the RAAF does not have an adequate capability in electronic warfare. It cannot operate into modern, defended environments. It lacks the ability to suppress electronically enemy air defences and it lacks the ability to look after itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most misleading elements is in relation to preparedness. Preparedness in a defence force relates to both the readiness of the personnel involved to go about their tasks and the ability to sustain them. It is no secret that the sustainability of the Australian Defence Force today does not exist. We have no stock holdings of missiles and ammunition to enable us to use the defence forces in a wartime setting. The readiness of some units is adequate but, without the ability to fight, it is all in vain. There is nothing in this report which gives any concrete proposals as to how the sustainability question is going to be addressed by increased stock holdings, because increased stock holdings require money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the army, there is quite a bit in the white paper about the reserves. What we have in the land force at the present time is totally inadequate. We have four under-strength infantry battalions. In three to five years time this will be raised to five under-strength infantry battalions. Because the army is a manpower-intensive organisation, the heart of the army is in the reserve infantry battalions, of which there are 14. They are all inadequately manned, inadequately trained and inadequately equipped. All that we get from the government is a vague proposal to look at their needs. There is no commitment to spend the hundreds of millions of dollars that are needed in equipment and training to bring them up to speed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also potential difficulties for the reserve in the reference to centralised training. I would argue that the quality of training for reservists is just as important as it is for regulars, and the quality of training that the regular force can provide is at a higher level. But the point is that a large part of the general reserve is involved in the training groups in the various states which have a pure training function. That absorbs a lot of officers and senior NCOs. If we eliminate those by transferring that function to the regulars, we do a great disservice to the reservists because we cut out the employment of officers and senior NCOs who are important for an expansion function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move to the most important failing of this report, and that relates to the funding. It is highly significant that the minister never once referred in this statement to the fact that he was gutting the Australian defence budget. The last <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defence of Australia</EMPHASIS> document, in 1987, called for between 2.6 per cent and 2.8 per cent of gross domestic product to be spent on defence and it set forth a series of objectives. The Australian Defence Force failed to reach all those objectives because it did not have enough money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government introduced the Sanderson report, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Force Structure Review</EMPHASIS>, which was a very flawed document intellectually. It cut 16 per cent out of the manpower in the uniform section of the Australian Defence Force. But even then it fell far short of what it set out to achieve in DOA 1987. This time it is promising even more in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Defending Australia 1994</EMPHASIS> than what it did in DOA 1987, yet it is proposing that there be less money for it. It is suggesting that approximately two per cent of the Australian GDP will be spent on defence for the next five or 10 years. Knowing this government, if it used the word `approximately' advisedly we are probably looking at 1.7 per cent to 1.8 per cent of the GDP going to defence, which is totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no such thing as defence on the cheap. This country is worth defending and it is worth having a defence force to protect it. The defence force spends money in this country and it spends it productively. It creates national pride and awareness. Above all, it gives us a sense of security and the freedom to pursue our own destiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even this paper states, `A military force that has been neglected in peace cannot be revived quickly when a threat emerges.' That is very true; yet there is no observation and application of that statement in the crucial area of funding, which the paper is all about. We live in a time when warning times are very short. We are saying that the Australian Defence Force has to be self-reliant, and that means a very high degree of readiness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aiming for a deterrent function in the defence force. We do not ever want the Australian Defence Force to fight; we want it to deter people who may feel that they have an interest in taking Australia on in a military sense. But if we are going to operate effectively in a deterrent role, then the reality of it has to be there, not the potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot fund a defence force in the good years and not fund it in the bad, because we must maintain professional experience and professional expertise. The complexity of weapon systems we have today take 10 or more years to develop. Look at something like the F111 fleet that we have. We are still developing the capabilities of that, although it has been in service for nearly 20 years. At the end of the day, we never know when we are going to need a defence force. All the experts have always been proved wrong historically when they have tried to predict threats and the timing of them. </PARA>

The need for more Collins class submarines will be reviewed in two years time and a number of equipment upgrades are planned. Significantly, defence funding is to be planned over five-year time frames, starting in 1996, to provide greater certainty than the present annual allocations provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the first defence white paper to be issued since the Cold War ended and the first since multilateral regional security consultations began. No previous white paper has been released in the context of a regional free trade agreement with major implications for our relations with our neighbours. These changes are all acknowledged in the document, but their importance is downplayed on the basis of a key argument that also underpinned the 1987 white paper. As the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) was at pains to emphasise, our force structure is planned on the basis of capabilities, not threats. Relations between countries can turn sour very quickly&mdash;so the argument goes&mdash;and it is too late to then build up our armed forces to counter the threat which has suddenly materialised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This paper goes on to state that the post-Cold War regional environment is more fluid and unpredictable than before, which means, in essence, that we have to be prepared for things to go wrong. Indeed, the bold statement is made on page 11 that `our strategic environment will become more demanding over the period covered by this white paper'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the time-honoured role of military planners to be pessimists who plan for the worst case scenario. But that statement, in the view of the Democrats, is taking pessimism too far because it ignores the fact that the culture of international relations is changing. It seems unarguable that the barriers to regional interdependence are lower now than they have ever been, and are set to drop much further. This means that the threshold of possible military action between Asia-Pacific states has been raised significantly in recent years, and is virtually certain to rise much further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not to deny that, as the minister says, military force is still an important element in international affairs. But the constraints on the hostile use of military force are greater now than ever before. Sure, there are parts of the world which are embroiled in intense and horrific armed conflict. But the trend is unmistakable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that our strategic environment is likely to become more manageable, not more demanding, in the period covered by this white paper. In saying that, I do not want to create the impression that we have a utopian view of the regional security environment. Military capabilities, particularly naval capabilities, are expected to grow as the decade wears on. The potential of a growing Chinese economy to support naval expansion is worrying. There are unresolved disputes which could spill over into intense but localised military conflict&mdash;for example, competing claims over the Spratly Islands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, for all that, we are witnessing the growth of an international interdependence through trade, tourism, communications, and cooperation in many fields which is making the use of military force in international affairs increasingly impermissible and ineffective. The Democrats would not argue, however, that likely improvements in the regional security environment mean we should immediately make huge defence spending cuts and cancel major equipment programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the improvement in our military security stands in direct contrast to the trend in our environmental security outlook. We have less cause to worry about military attack than we did 10 years ago, but much more reason to be concerned about the greenhouse effect, land degradation, and population growth. The social foundations of national security, such as low unemployment and an equitable distribution of wealth, are also under much greater challenge now than in previous decades. Global health care is faced with new challenges caused by the growth of international travel. In the Democrats' view, some inescapable conclusions arise from these realities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most obvious is that we need to re-examine our security priorities. Security is becoming more multi-dimensional, and it is bad policy to continue to look at defence in isolation. It is time for a thorough review of the challenges we face and the best way to balance and integrate our responses. That is the basis of the bill I recently introduced to establish a parliamentary commission of inquiry into Australia's security priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This white paper represents the exact opposite of the scheme outlined in my bill. Instead of looking at security in the broad, it looks at military defence in narrow isolation. And instead of engaging with the community by providing for public input, it has been developed in almost total secrecy. This white paper speaks of the importance of engaging the community but it has failed to involve the Australian public in the most fundamental way&mdash;by encouraging public debate about our security priorities and how they might be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it would be foolish for the defence establishment to assume that the community will always be content to leave security and defence to the experts. There are plenty of signs of a difference in view. A recent EPAC paper found that the average Australian believes that defence spending should be 20 per cent less than it is so that more can be spent on, for example, environmental protection. To engage the community requires more than token forms of interaction. It requires real dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In our opinion, a rational assessment of our security priorities would lead to a number of conclusions which are at odds with the conclusions of the white paper. Firstly, more effort should be put into developing a proper coastal protection system which could play a support role to our front-line forces in the event of attack. For all the rhetoric about the need to meet low-level incursions, it is still possible for a boat-load of Vietnamese refugees to sail undetected into Darwin harbour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there should be more emphasis on getting value from the ADF in peace-time, by purchasing appropriate dual-use equipment. As an example, the Democrats have long argued that Canadair amphibious aircraft have great potential for water bombing in the bushfire season as well as for coastal surveillance and interception. Thirdly, we should begin a regional arms control debate through the ASEAN regional forum. Instead of spending taxpayers' funds on two more submarines, as this white paper suggests we might, why not abandon that plan now and propose instead to add naval arms control to the regional security agenda?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, we would limit regional military cooperation to areas which have clear security benefits and do not implicate Australia in human rights abuses. In our view and, I might add, in the view of many people in every party in this parliament, the training of Indonesian special forces does not fall into that category and should be discontinued. Training for peacekeeping, and joint maritime zone patrols, are a different matter. The Democrats strongly believe that regional engagement should not be allowed to override our fundamental values. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, we would put more emphasis on peacekeeping than the case by case approach outlined in the white paper. As flawed as the United Nations is, it must be reformed and built up so that it can play a pivotal role on the world security stage. Our security future lies more with the United Nations and emerging regional institutions than with the United States, and our defence policy should better reflect that reality. For example, the US-Australian bases at Pine Gap and Nurrungar should increasingly be tasked to serve the legitimate security functions of the United Nations if they are to have any future role here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, we should make the size of the defence budget, and the way in which it is spent, much more accountable. There should be more debate over our security priorities, as I have already mentioned, and there should be greater security to ensure that taxpayers' funds are being spent effectively and efficiently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing either new or too alarming in this document. But it has failed to accommodate changes in our regional environment and in community opinion. It is a source of frustration to the Democrats that we have not been presented with a bolder, more forward-looking blueprint. The longer we wait to grasp the nettle, the more opportunities and resources will be wasted. </PARA>

During that process I asked the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) several questions in relation to how policy is reviewed, how it is costed and how various options are worked out as to whether or not they are economically efficient or actually meet the needs of security, and the minister refused to answer these questions. He did say, however, that there would be a policy review in this white paper. I looked and looked and none of those questions were addressed, strangely enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have picked out some of my favourite pieces in the minister's speech. One of them is on page 6 and reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will continue to use the most cost-effective means to ensure our security.</PARA>
<PARA>Considering, as the minister mentioned in the estimates process, the department does not do any cost analysis of different policies&mdash;or, if it did, he did not mention them&mdash;I am wondering how it works out what the most cost effective means is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disappointment is that, because the opposition has a policy on increasing defence spending, whenever the spending is in defence areas it is also loath to look those costings in the mouth, even if there is great waste. Unfortunately, it is left to the Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats to question that cost effectiveness, and sometimes there is huge waste within the defence budget. Because of this philosophical idea that defence spending must be quarantined and increased, this accountability stops short. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been mentioned, this defence white paper is simply more of the same. It contains some new politically correct definitions that we are now planning for the `capability' of our neighbours' weaponry, troops, training and equipment instead of their imminent threat and it hangs on tightly to the rhetoric of self-reliance. Drawing from this fundamental premise, the paper advocates a number of continuing large capital acquisitions, such as more Collins class submarines, the possibility of spy satellites, helicopters for the Anzac frigates, new patrol boats, an upgrade of the P3C <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Orion</EMPHASIS> aircraft and two new heavy landing ships to replace training ship HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jervis Bay</EMPHASIS> and heavy landing ship HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These acquisitions continue the line of forward defence or offensive defence that the government upholds. No major changes are foreshadowed with our aircraft force of long range F111s and FA18s. The government may have learnt the lessons of a dependence on American defence goods in the past. This lesson came after we acquired additional F111 aircraft and, shortly afterwards, the United States threatened to scrap its whole fleet, which would have left Australia high and dry and without United States expertise and spares to continue operating our force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our Collins class submarines are ridiculously expensive, so much so that we could not sell them for the amount they cost us to build. It is even more ludicrous that we want more Collins class submarines as it is impossible to pay a reasonable price for them. The six we are locked in to building now have cost us $820 million each at current prices, up from initial figures of $400 million. Likewise, the six Anzac frigates have not been without their problems and have cost us $540 million each, although the original figure was half that at $240 million each. These projects have doubled in cost at a time when we are pushing arms exports and handing over intellectual property to try to make our defence self-reliance activities back home profitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention how pitiful it is that DSTO receives half of CSIRO's budget, yet the DSTO is solely for defence related activities and defence research benefits from CSIRO's contribution to Department of Defence research. That defence research is taking such a precedence when CSIRO is suffering cuts which benefit all Australians is extraordinary and harmful to the direction we are taking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the white paper defence activities will continue to be commercialised, with the rule of thumb being that industries limit their defence activities to 25 per cent in order for them to stay in business. It is a statement in itself about the hopelessness of self-reliance. Industries are continuing to be highly subsidised in long range high technology projects that we do not necessarily need or want, but they are perpetuated by the notion of self-reliance and that we need to learn how to make these items ourselves. This is an extremely problematic concept because, due to this new high technology direction, we are more heavily reliant on technology transfer from the United States. So how can this be deemed as promoting self-reliance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again and again in the white paper the government articulates that its rationale for being self-reliant in the first place is that we cannot expect the United States to help us in our region. The Department of Defence has found itself in a state of non-preparedness in the past, but there is no indication in this paper that these problems will be addressed. I refer to the results of the Department of Defence inquiry into Australia's military preparedness, which found that we have depleted war stocks and stockholdings of munitions and other equipment which would need to be supplied by the United States in order for us to defend ourselves. This is not self-reliance; it is critical dependence on foreign sources and is a reality for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite all this heavy spending, high technology solutions and large capital acquisitions, we have overlooked our basic reliance on troops and munitions in favour of the unreliable high technology approach. I notice this is a point which Senator Newman made as well. We are shooting ourselves in the foot with arms exports. The paper states that we have a modest defence export record in 1993-94 through exporting only $70 million worth of arms control defence related equipment. It is true that it is even more modest than that because the majority of that figure would be made up of sporting firearms, ammunition, offset activities and the defence cooperation program. Although I must add that `sporting firearms' means guns and we are exporting guns to Singapore where individuals cannot own a gun licence. So we are talking about a lethal weapon which is hardly sporting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree also with Senator Newman, and I mentioned this at the time, that the defence export policy is a failure. As a policy for making arms cheaper, it is a failure. As a policy for increasing income for Australia, it is a failure. We have spent hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies and the official export figure is $17 million. So the reality is that if we are talking about employment it is a very expensive way to get it. It is certainly not helping us in any other way that I can see. It has certainly downgraded any particular emphasis on human rights and the impact of real regional security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we have small figures like this it does not mean that we should not bear the true responsibility of the impact of those defence arms exports we have made&mdash;the impact on regional security and on the local populations of our neighbours, who we can develop close relations with. In fact, the tighter the buyers' market the more likely we are to make stupid decisions which will embarrass Australia on the world stage and have an impact on human rights in the area. For instance, when we export to Cambodia, Thailand, Vietnam, Korea, Indonesia and Papua New Guinea we are aiding the repression of the local people. They could be persecuted for a number of reasons&mdash;political and civil expression, ethnic fighting, separatism or for standing up for environmental degradation or social and economic exploitation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 8 of the white paper the government admits that these tensions are a source of regional instability and a low level threat for Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ethnic and national tensions, economic rivalry, disappointed aspirations for prosperity, religious or racial conflict, or other problems could produce an unstable and potentially dangerous strategic situation in Asia and the Pacific over the next 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA>However, we are happy to be gung-ho and keep supplying these  nations with defence exports to help them control their internal problems or their local people and, by doing that, we actually inflame them. We are fuelling more problems by not dealing with the roots of conflict. This creates further instability and we become more on our guard to maintain our high technology solutions or, in Defence's terminology, to meet our neighbours' capabilities. Defence is foolish if it does not realise that capabilities are easily transferable into threats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to mention the continued lack of accountability in defence activities. I have mentioned it briefly before. I note that the future of the Australian bases may be in doubt after the year 2000, which I welcome. However, I am extremely concerned about the lack of information and public accountability and the secrecy that surrounds defence procedures. In this chamber people have heard in very recent times my degree of annoyance that Australian Defence Industries, a wholly government owned enterprise, and other related corporations did not have their documents ready in time for the first estimates committee hearings this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lack of policy accountability process would not pass a public company accountability test. The reality is that we do expect more, and the fact is that the more money we spend on defence the more accountable it should be, not less. While nominal defence spending has declined, actual expenditures are increasingly hidden. The corporatisation of Defence reduces accountability and makes it appear that there is less money in Defence than is the case. An example is the Australian Submarine Corporation, which is 49 per cent federal government owned, but through the Australian Industries Development Corporation not through Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence Industries were previously directed under the control of the Department of Defence and funded from its budget. Bit by bit we have noticed that other peacekeeping related activities will now be farmed off to the particular departments involved, so that other departments' budgets will be involved in Defence activities, which in reality means increased Defence expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major problem in relation to both peacetime domestic security and peacetime operations is also the problem of skilled and less skilled personnel. In peacetime operations personnel with specific training are often required. The majority of Australia's capacity in a few skill areas may be involved in peacekeeping operations, even if the total troop commitment is small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Cambodia most of the communications personnel from all units were involved. In Africa it was the engineers. This leaves the ADF domestically without key components, personnel who are not easily replaced. This comes down to what we put our emphasis on, whether we provide decent conditions for our personnel or whether we siphon that money into war toys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens oppose an open cheque for peacekeeping. This should be identifiable. If we are planning to go into more peacekeeping in the future&mdash;and that is a debatable point&mdash;if we are planning to be more involved in a regional army kind of set up, a standard force of some sort which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has mooted, then the public needs to know what is involved. They need to have this debate, because we need to set out what this is likely to cost. If it does, it may well be held in a separate account, perhaps under Prime Minister and Cabinet. However, it should not come from somewhere else, general revenue or other programs. Therefore, if we are going to do this we need to know what it costs, what we are planning for and we need to make sure we are not pulling out from other social budgets in order to fund a virtual open cheque for peacekeeping in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One solution that has been mentioned is to provide extensive specialist training within the peacetime military to look at some of those peacekeeping requirements. This allows us to meet specialist needs in peacekeeping without compromising security. This would also be consistent with the core force concept of a disproportionate number of specialists and members capable of leadership, allowing a rapid up-take of basic soldiers in the event of actual threat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ready reserves have not proved effective. Intake is low and troops are far more expensive than initially estimated, costing some 80 per cent of regular troops. I would like to also refer to some of my other favourite purple patches from the minister's speech, which state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, the government will continue to pursue a more effective partnership between Defence and Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Defence has a very strong policy of supporting industry development. It gives millions to industry. It has a subprogram, industry involvement and contracting, that is funded at about $90 million a year by the Department of Defence essentially as an industry lobby group to Defence and government. Virtually all its acquisition and policy programs include specific support for industry, often well funded. It spends billions building equipment from scratch that could be bought or built in existing facilities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other purple patch relating to this is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will emphasise investment in high-technology capabilities which increase our security.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know how. It promotes private defence industry, builds and sells production works such as the Australian Submarine Corporation with Swedish company Kockums or the Anzac frigate venture with Transfield. It sees a role in establishing these even though it proves expensive with about $200 million added to the cost of each Collins class sub or Anzac frigate because of its policies. In the newest project, the mine hunters, the hull is a basic design that could have been built in a number of existing shipyards, shipyards craving business. Government is again funding a whole new shipyard to build six ships. The electronics, the most expensive part of the ships, are imported in either case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to try to keep these industries afloat&mdash;excuse the pun&mdash;and reduce its cost, government supports exports. This export promotion, and the need for exports costs taxpayers money and results in conflicts of interest in an arms exports regulatory regime already dominated by Defence. We could refer back to my speech on that with the defence exports inquiry for the problems involved with that conflict of interest. The consequence is stupidities like selling small arms to Indonesia or Thailand and a government-backed push for export of major weapons platforms to our neighbours and technology transfers which means that by that stage we have no control over what happens to that technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As it states in 11.4, our defence exports are modest. This is because they are expensive. There is an abundance of surplus equipment available to buyers. The small amount of exports only makes Australian defence industries more economically untenable and increases pressure to export at any cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer also to Senator Ray's comments that we respond to capabilities not threats. If we think about it, this is a vicious cycle. If we are supplying or helping to supply the high technology war toys to other countries in our region, then of course we are going to respond to that. If we are supplying high technology equipment, others will get it from us and other places if we are seen to be leading the way. Then what we are doing is leading the establishment in our other regional arms race, and it has been well acknowledged that one of the few regions which is still spending on defence is our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been mentioned by Senator Woodley that an EPAC study in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian </EMPHASIS>indicated that the Australian public actually believe that they would prefer a 20 per cent cut in Australia's defence spending. This is what the public is saying about where they want public money to go to. The very least that is necessary is for the government to increase its accountability of what it is spending at the moment. There are plenty of ideas about how we over time could concentrate more on security and less on offensive defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases are seen as important in surveillance and in troop presence in the north. Yet these are exactly the areas where we are most fervidly trying to sell arms. Finally, with all the expectations a 15-year plan for our nation's defence brings, there is nothing new or inspiring in this document. As usual, there is little information on procurement, costings, training or strategic planning which is usual for defence. What we see, however, is a possible ratcheting of defence spending in 1996-97. So we are seeing plans put into concrete, a five-year budget commitment and long-term&mdash;not just short term&mdash;unaccountability. On page 5 of the minister's statement he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are also strongly committed to transparency in defence planning in order to build trust and reduce suspicion.</PARA>
<PARA>It is, but industry gets a great many more documents which are more easily obtained than we in the parliament get&mdash;a lot of assistance and a lot of information. It does not come to us and it is not debated at any length in this particular parliament. So the government is not accountable to the parliament and the transparency is not here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 12 there is an indication in relation to these longer-term targets which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond that modest real increases will be needed to meet the demands of an increasingly complex defence environment.</PARA>
<PARA>I also want to articulate my deep concern that when Senator Ray called for submissions this year for the white paper he said that the public would not be invited to make submissions because they were not capable of commenting on the highly complex issues relating to defence. Instead, he chose to focus on the opinions of the Defence industry, the Australian Defence Force and defence academics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of these people would have a fairly narrow definition of `defence' and many would indeed have a vested interest in an ever-decreasing defence budget and larger outlays on big capital projects. I also refer to the PR statement on bush fires in this report. It seems that the people in New South Wales might disagree that this has been a good PR exercise for the military considering they went in there without any proper equipment or training. It seems that as a PR exercise, as an excuse for what is currently being done in this Defence white paper, it might not carry much water with the people of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the Australian public that wants a different notion of security and different priorities for defence spending. Many community groups and individuals are calling for a less high tech and expensive approach to defence, making it more people-based. They want to be consulted and they want more confidence-building measures to enhance regional security and our relationships with neighbours. They want to re-direct spending on arms exports to helping the people in the nations to which we are exporting these weapons that kill and maim. They also want to see inefficient defence industries converted to civilian operations, as is happening in Western Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cost to date of the blown-out Collins class submarine project and the Anzac frigates projects is close to $10 billion. Yet, at the end of the day, our large coastline is not any closer to being defended, we have large hospital queues, our farming sector and rural communities are in disarray, and our schools and universities are suffering cutbacks. Taxpayers' money could be far better spent on directly helping the people of Australia through social justice initiatives, repairing the environment and improving health, housing, education and community services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter has a fairly long history but, in essence, it arises out of the concerns expressed on all sides of the chamber in relation to the proliferation of mobile telephone towers, particularly digital towers, to the proximity of those towers to schools and homes, and to what quite often seems to be the cavalier approach taken by the carriers to the process of negotiation and consultation with local residents. Indeed, I have received a number of complaints that when the going got rough the result was that, overnight, a tower appeared and the carriers effectively dared the local community to do something about it. I do not think that was ever a viable option for the carriers or for anybody else. Over time, sanity has prevailed and we have achieved a modus vivendi.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to recognise that the provisions of the final code, as it is called, still did not require a sufficient degree of advice to residents of the local communities. Indeed, it left the matter in the hands of local councils. Going on past history, one could not always assume that they would adequately bring the matter to the attention of the ratepayers. It certainly seemed to us that one way of achieving that was effectively to require those councils to advertise and give residents the opportunity to express their views on a proposal&mdash;not open-endedly, because I do not think anyone wants to see inordinate or indefinite delays in the rollout of the digital network, but we certainly wanted to see a process that would give people sufficient opportunity to complain and to work through some of the concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of those representations, on 13 October I gave notice of intention to disallow the code. Since that time, I think it is fair to say, Senator Bourne and I, in our different ways, have been negotiating with the carriers to achieve a satisfactory outcome. I think we have reached that stage today&mdash;coincidentally, the last day before the code would be automatically disallowed if there had not been a debate on the motion.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I think we all agree that the draft telecommunications national code, which was replaced by the full code on 30 June, was inadequate. We have all heard horror stories of mobile phone towers being put up with no community notification or consultation. The present code is an improvement in that disputes over proposed towers can be quickly referred to the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. However, as Senator Alston said, it is still up to local government authorities and to the carriers as to whether they tell local residents that a tower might be built near their backyards and to give them a chance to respond.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats take the view that mandatory notification and consultation with communities should be provided for in the case of environmentally significant activities, such as the installation of mobile phone towers. As a minimum, this should involve prompt notification of local residents through letterbox drops and ads in the local press, as well as an avenue for providing written and verbal comments. In the event that there is significant community concern, public hearings should also be held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are aware that, under the auspices of the Australian Local Government Association, the Municipal Association of Victoria is negotiating with the carriers on guidelines for community notification and consultation in the case of high impact activities, such as tower construction. The Democrats welcome this development but we are not satisfied that it is enough. There is a real possibility that the negotiations could be unnecessarily protracted. Also, there is an overarching requirement for community notification and consultation which should be given the force of law by being included in this code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we came to the view that disallowance was a last resort because it would create a legal vacuum. That is why we approached the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) and have obtained three undertakings from him and the carriers. The first is that the carriers will abide by the spirit of the draft guidelines from tomorrow. The second is that the MAV guidelines will be extended nationally by the end of February, resources permitting. The third is that the code will be subjected to a full review by AUSTEL from 1 July 1995.

The first is the letter from the minister to the three carriers, to which they responded with the letters that Senator Alston has just tabled.

It is clear that the Australian public will benefit from the provision of efficient, modern and cost-effective telecommunications services. The public are also clear winners from the new competitive environment that this government has created.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention some figures relating to the impact of competition in Australia on the growth of the mobile communications market. In June 1993 there were approximately 650,000 mobile phone customers. This had risen to one million customers by March of this yer. By September 1994, the latest month for which there are figures, there were 1,400,000 customers. In other words, customer numbers have grown by more that 100 per cent over the last 15 months or so. I am informed that numbers are currently growing at about 1,500 new customers each day.</PARA>

It is against this background of public demand for mobile services that carriers are aiming to expand and deepen their network coverage in order that the public demand can be met.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these circumstances, it is also incumbent on the government to ensure that uniform national procedures are in place to facilitate network development. But environmental considerations are not overlooked. In the past, Telecom enjoyed very broad powers and immunities. With the advent of competition, these powers and immunities were wound back via the combination of regulations passed by this parliament under the Telecommunications Act 1991 and the draft telecommunications national code formulated in December 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further obligations have now been imposed on carriers in the code determined by the minister on 30 June. Circumstances are clearly spelled out where carriers will automatically be required to notify the secretary to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories of their planned activities and the carriers are not able to go ahead with those activities until the secretary advises them that they can proceed. I think those provisions effectively provide the secretary with the veto power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new code also specifically provides a role for local councils to receive full details of the carriers' proposed activities to enable affected communities to be consulted. In addition, where there is still disagreement between a carrier and a local government authority about the environmental significance of a proposed mobile facility site, that proposal must be referred to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories if the council so requests. Again, the carrier cannot proceed until any objections by the department are resolved. Carriers are also now required to collocate cellular mobile towers wherever it is technically feasible and compatible with network configuration. This will minimise any adverse effects on the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The code also provides a measure of flexibility about the notification process. I am informed that the carriers have taken the responsible step and, with the Municipal Association of Victoria, are discussing an arrangement that will take advantage of the code's flexibility. The discussions are leading to a guideline that will relate to the level of notification and consultation required of the carriers on the impact of their activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston's approach of disallowing the code would have meant a much less stringent regulatory environment governing the carriers' activities.

I am pleased that Senator Alston has decided to take the more sensible approach and withdraw his notice of motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out to the Senate that, following discussions with Democrat Senator Vicky Bourne, the Minister for Communications and the Arts proposes to hold a formal review of the operation of the code, beginning on 1 July 1995. The review will be conducted by Austel. By that time, there will be 12 months experience by which to judge the new code and the review will enable the community to comment on its operations. It is in the carriers' interests to ensure that their track record by that time is positive. </PARA>

While the negotiations are proceeding, it is the government's expectation that the carriers will abide by the spirit of the guideline, particularly with respect to those activities that will have a high impact on local communities, and will endeavour to apply the guidelines nationwide. The carriers have assured the minister that they will do so. For the information of senators I seek leave to table the responses from the carriers. I suspect that that will be duplicating what Senator Alston has already tabled; but I cannot be sure that the letters I seek to table are the same. </PARA>

Are the guarantee provisions contained in the bill intended to apply only to the MUA league consortium to buy ANL or would the guarantee provisions be offered to any and all potential bidders for ANL?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the minister's reply, as I recall it&mdash;and I jotted down a couple of his responses&mdash;he said that it could apply beyond the MUA lead consortium, but that it depended on whether it was appropriate in the circumstances, or words to that effect.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question, as I interpret it, relates to who might be part of a consortium bidding at some future time, if ANL were on the market, to purchase ANL and whether this relates to them. It does not relate to any of that side of the arrangements at all. It strictly focuses on the need to provide a guarantee for the debts of the organisation and the other arrangements necessary to carry it through. I hope that the situation is clearer than it was before lunch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would quote from a news release, put out by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton), of 22 August 1994, referring to the arrangements he had made to institute the new board for the purposes of defining options for the ANL. In the concluding paragraph of that press release, he says:</PARA>

It is the government's intention to enable the ANL's board to come up with a plan to restructure the ANL so it can continue to operate. The purpose of guaranteeing the draw-down, and the loans that underpin the ANL in the meanwhile, is to achieve that outcome. I believe that the alternative to that is to create problems in the market and undermine the ability of the ANL to continue at all.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not pursue this any further. Senator Cook obviously does not have a clue what he is talking about. I will save him further embarrassment by not pursuing it. I have to say that the obfuscation that Senator Cook is showing in his handling of this matter, and his obvious lack of knowledge and understanding, is absolutely typical of what I said in my speech during the second reading debate: the government has handled this whole ANL matter during the last three years in a disgraceful manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through its handling of this matter, the government has potentially caused a considerable cost to the Australian taxpayer. It has certainly caused grave damage to the shipping line and, therefore, to Australia's shipping industry. From the way that Senator Cook has conducted this debate today&mdash;and I accept the fact that it is not his portfolio; but he should be better briefed and know more about what he is supposed to be handling in this place&mdash;all I can say is heaven knows how this government has managed to keep its incompetence at only this level. I will not pursue that, because I am obviously not going to get any further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to ask a couple more questions arising from an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>. I presume Senator Cook has seen it and, therefore, I hope he has been briefed on it because I think it is a very serious article. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The global shipping company Sealand and local transport company Linfox appear set to finalise a consortium offer for the Federal Government-owned shipping line ANL by Christmas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The consortium will be in a position to make the only union-blessed offer for the troubled ANL when tenders open next year, giving it a clear edge over other bidders.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an extremely serious report&mdash;if it is correct&mdash;because the tender process has not even opened yet. Expressions of interest were called only in the last four or five weeks. Is there any validity in that statement, particularly when it quotes from the Maritime Union's response? The union is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"The other consortiums aren't interested in having employee share arrangements&mdash;they've got a number of ideas which just aren't compatible to our way of thinking, or any good for ANL in the long term."</PARA>
<PARA>For those reports to be in the press before the tender process has even opened raises matters of very great concern. I hope that Senator Cook has been briefed on that, because it has a direct bearing on this bill. I invite the minister to comment on it, because the Senate obviously cannot be left in the dark on a matter of such concern. </PARA>

So I have not read every newspaper in Australia today, which is a bit unusual for me I know. I have seen the article that Senator Short referred to, but I have not read it.

Any further consideration of a sale, which would involve an open tender process, will be dependent on the restructuring exercise.

We may not be able to progress it any further at this stage today, unless the minister has anything further to add, which, it appears, he has not, but it is something that I urge the government to look at very quickly.

In passing, I express the opinion that the proposal to insert this new section virtually proves the point that Senator Troeth, Senator Margetts and I made about the increased complexity which has been brought about by the government's decision to set up a whole new arrangement which will therefore need a whole new lot of cross-references. I really want to ask about amendment No. 29, which is on the following page, page 8. Again, the amendment refers to clause 18, page 181.

If the Secretary could have made a determination to suspend or cancel, or increase or reduce the rate of, a youth training allowance, section 164 provides that the determination is taken to have been made.</PARA>

In discussions outside the chamber, Senator Harradine referred to the fact that a departmental officer can be appointed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Senator Harradine suggested that the issue be referred to the Administrative Review Council for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Administrative Review Council issued a discussion paper in September of this year.

However, the papers states that there is no indication that departmental members of the tribunal have not carried out their responsibilities in an appropriate manner.

As indicated during the debate, the minister, Mr Free, met with the NUS officers and reached general agreement on their concerns about the bill. It was agreed that NUS would monitor the involvement of DEET officers with the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and advise the minister if it considered that this was a problem.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out the coalition's concern that three months may not be a long enough time in this day and age for a young person, with no understanding of the system, to receive notification of the decision, to realise that he or she has the right of appeal and then to finally file an appeal.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts' proposed amendment seeks to loosen the obligation of an unemployed person to negotiate an activity agreement. The government is providing substantial funds to assist unemployed people and there is an expectation that they will be responsible in seeking appropriate employment. This expectation is reflected in the relevant provision, section 81, which applies only if the young person is acting unreasonably in refusing to enter an activity agreement. On this basis the legislation requires that activity agreements are to take into account the client's education, experience, skills, age and physical condition&mdash;see section 84(a).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendment would place undue weight on young people's free decisions on whether they should continue to receive public funding if they refuse to enter realistic activity agreements. In any event, young people can appeal to an independent tribunal if they believe the department is being too harsh in its requirement that they enter an activity agreement. I emphasise that we have to get the balance right, as far as possible, between the obligation of public administration to ensure the public's money is properly accounted for and wisely spent, and the right of the individual to be well treated. In any area of public administration there are often grey areas of judgment. I think this legislation is about the right balance but we will have to wait and see how it operates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise that last point: there is a provision for people to appeal to an independent tribunal if they think they are being harshly treated. Whatever else Senator Margetts may think, we have put an appeals provision into the act in this area. I hope it never is used but if young people are feeling harshly dealt with they can appeal to an independent tribunal. </PARA>

I should have thought that the overwhelming majority of 16-year-olds would still have some contact with parents and relatives.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Looking at the first amendment moved by Senator Margetts in particular, I would remind the minister that the amendment actually proposes that a person is not to be taken to have failed or to be unreasonably delaying merely because the person is continuing, or seeking to continue, to engage in reasonable and bona fide negotiation. To me, that means that if the young person is not satisfied with the first proposition put forward by the case manager and seeks to vary it, or negotiate to have another go at it, then that person should not be taken to have failed. As I interpret it, this is just the first instance. This is just a case of wanting to have another go at it, or have a look at another arrangement. All that the amendment does is ensure that the person is able to take another step without being clobbered over the head and sent one of these letters, winding the appeal process up and getting it all official.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This set of amendments would make the administrative process much less formidable and much more workable. It does not extend it forever. It does not say anywhere that the person can continue ad infinitum, or anything else. It says that people have not failed just because they want to continue it and seek another opportunity. I wonder whether the minister would reconsider that because it makes it more efficient and less likely to result in these appeals that he speaks of. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be supporting amendments Nos 1 and 2. We believe they allow just a bit more of a two-way negotiation process. The coalition's philosophical position has always been to make the person entering the system fairly rigorously accountable, but I am taking particular note of the age of the people involved in this procedure and I take the view that for a 15-, 16- or 17-year-old to enter the bureaucratic process would involve a degree of maturity that I suspect not many people at that age possess. I think that to accept these amendments would ensure that at the last resort people are not forced into an agreement which would be totally wrong for them. The wording allows that if the negotiation is not reasonable and bone fide they will be disqualified and I think this provides the flexibility that we would be looking for in amendments Nos 1 and 2. As I understand it, Senator Margetts' amendment No. 3 deals with the activity test&mdash;is that right?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The request for amendment 3 is in addition to 77(1)(b), which currently says that the person must have been receiving youth training allowance for three months before starting voluntary work for an organisation. My amendment allows for voluntary work to take place at an organisation that a person may have had previous involvement with before receiving the youth training allowance.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Margetts for that explanation. The coalition will also be supporting that amendment. We have always held the view that voluntary work is to be encouraged and it seems fair enough to support this amendment. Otherwise, if people start voluntary work almost immediately after losing their job and then become eligible for the youth training allowance, they will have to stop their voluntary work for three months and start again. We do not believe that is particularly fair. So we will be supporting that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We believe that the last line of amendment No. 1 which says `with a view to the free acceptance of such an agreement by both parties' places undue emphasis on free acceptance. We think that our wording of `reasonable' is more appropriate to a proper balance between the rights of the government in running the program and the obligations on both sides, including those of the person involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding amendment No. 3, which Senator Troeth has just spoken to, we believe the emphasis for youth training allowance is on helping young people to become financially self-supporting through paid employment. While it is recognised that voluntary work can help young people in the transition to paid employment, there are limitations on the extent to which young people can receive the youth training allowance while undertaking voluntary work. Although voluntary agencies are responsible and contribute significantly to the community, it should be recognised that the proposed amendment would create the possibility that an organisation could use the legislation to have the government pay for its young supporters to work for it on a voluntary basis which, of course, defeats the purpose of providing a training allowance and the training component. So the government opposes the amendments from Senator Margetts. </PARA>

For example, if we delete `both' in the second line in amendment 1 and replace it with `the', so that it reads `by the parties', that is an amendment that we could live with. We are more concerned about amendment No. 3, which deals with voluntary work. We would like to discuss those issues further with the opposition and the minority parties because we are a bit concerned that we may open up a couple of loopholes and get some unintended consequences that we will all regret a bit later. This is often the problem when we do not have further discussion. We may be able to come to some satisfactory arrangement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Nursing Home Standards Review Panel annual reports outline the operations of the state review panels into nursing home standards. I do not wish to speak for more than a few minutes on these annual reports. However, there is one matter which I wish to bring to the attention of the Senate. By way of background, the Victorian Nursing Homes Standards Review Panel undertook two reviews in 1993-94; the Queensland panel undertook one review; and the New South Wales panel undertook four reviews. In all of these reviews, except the one in Queensland, the decision of the standards monitoring teams were upheld.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of senators in the chamber who are not fully aware of it, there is a process called standards monitoring where nursing homes are subjected to a monitoring test by a standards monitoring team to assess whether they have adhered to outcome standards set down by the Commonwealth for the care of elderly residents in their nursing homes. There has been some debate about the standards monitoring teams as to whether they are uniform across the states, et cetera, but we have seen some improvements in those standards monitoring teams. In one case in Queensland a nursing home failed to meet the standards according to the standards monitoring team and the review overturned that decision. It is about that review that I want to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition received representations from the Denmora Nursing Home in Bowen Hills, Queensland, in which that nursing home complained that it had suffered financially following an adverse standards monitoring visit, the findings of which were ultimately overturned on the official review. The crucial point was not the initial adverse findings of the standards monitoring team but the fact that the then assistant secretary of the residential care, quality and rights branch of the Department of Human Services and Health wrote to all the local doctors on 25 November 1993 advising that on that day Denmora had been advised of an adverse standards assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Naturally, such a letter had a dramatic and adverse effect on the reputation and financial viability of the nursing home, because referrals to the nursing home come largely from the local doctors. In January 1994 a review of the findings of the standards monitoring team gave Denmora the all-clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review panel made a recommendation not to declare that the home did not meet the standards. The panel found that the seven objectives had now been substantially met and action taken to maintain them. When I asked in the estimates hearings on 18 November whether it was normal practice for the department to send out such a letter, given the obvious effects that such a letter would have on the reputation and financial viability of the nursing home in question, I was told by Mr Griew of the department that if a home is found to be in serious breach of standards it is a procedure that is sometimes followed to send a letter to local doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two points need to be emphasised. First, I see this as an unfair approach&mdash;to issue letters notifying local doctors of adverse monitoring reports before a review has been undertaken. If it is thought necessary to notify the local doctors, the doctor should be told that this is what has happened but that this decision is subject to a review. Then the doctors would be aware that the nursing home has a second chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it was disclosed at the estimates hearing that there is no requirement for a second letter to be circulated to clarify the status of the nursing home once a review has overturned the standards monitoring team assessment. Further, the Commonwealth is apparently not liable at law if the findings of a standards monitoring team, which are subsequently overturned, have caused financial detriment to a nursing home, its proprietors or staff. It seems from answers given at the estimates hearing that if the department had acted in good faith and without malice, it would come under qualified privilege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of concern to me, as it should be to other honourable senators, that we have to ensure that the department should not be in a position to ruin the reputation of a nursing home by circulating a letter to doctors advising of an adverse standards monitoring report before a review has been held. As I said, if the monitoring team thinks it is necessary then the doctors ought to be informed that that review is going to take place and the department ought to have an obligation to send a second letter advising that the adverse finding has been overturned. I believe this is an issue that the department and the government ought to address. If they tell the doctors that a home has failed the standards test, and the matter is then reviewed and that home is deemed not to have failed, there is an obligation on the department to advise the doctors accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA>Before I make comment on the annual report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, I would like to compliment my colleagues Senator Kemp and Senator Harradine on their very good speeches about the problems that this country faces with international treaties. I look forward to the adjourned debate. </PARA>

Under the departmental guidelines stipulating the reporting dates for annual reports, this report should have been in this house by 31 October. I understand that it was presented to the Attorney-General on 17 October. It has taken all that time to find its way into this house. If the departmental guidelines established for the tabling of annual reports are not to be followed, with respect, the guidelines are quite meaningless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This delay means that the members of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee were not given a real opportunity to peruse the annual report before that committee's deliberations. Indeed, at that hearing the other day I was confronted with the situation of being presented with the untabled report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission consisting of some 258 pages. I was supposed to digest that during the hearing and ask appropriate questions about it. I must say, that is not good enough, either from the departmental point of view or from a ministerial point of view. I hope that in the future these reports will be tabled by the appropriate date, enabling senators to make appropriate inquiries so we can ask appropriate questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During that committee's hearings I had the opportunity to flick through the annual report of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. Given that racial hatred legislation was a matter of public discussion, I turned to that section of the report and gave it some consideration. I noticed that in 1993-94, 458 complaints were accepted within the jurisdiction of the Racial Discrimination Act. Employment related complaints constituted the largest proportion, being 57 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of most interest was the number of complaints lodged under the legislation specifically on the ground of incitement to unlawful acts. For the period 1993-94, there were absolutely no complaints for incitement to unlawful acts in relation to racial matters. I found that very interesting, given the fact that the government is trying to foist certain legislation on the Australian people. I thought that 1993-94 may possibly not be representative so I went back further. I have the table in front of me. In relation to incitement to unlawful acts, in 1989-90 there were only two complaints. Both of those were in New South Wales, which has racial discrimination legislation. In 1990-91, there was only one complaint&mdash;that was in Queensland. In 1991-92 there were no complaints. In 1992-93 there was one in Victoria&mdash;and Victoria is to have its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of the two complaints lodged with the commission in 1989-90 no explanation was provided in the annual report as to whether these cases were settled, resolved or withdrawn. No explanation was provided in the annual report as to the virtual non-existence of cases specifically lodged with the commission on the basis of incitement to unlawful acts. As a result, one has to question the government's motive in introducing such legislation as the Racial Hatred Bill when the statistics from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission suggest that the few alleged cases that do exist, exist in states that already have racial discrimination laws. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make a few remarks about the annual report of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the AFMA. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) is in the chamber. He knows I have some interest in fishery matters. As a person who has been interested in fishing all his life, over the years I have been concerned&mdash;like a lot of my friends&mdash;about what appears to be an overall reduction in fishery stocks right around Australia, particularly in areas where amateurs can fish. It is a problem. I am pleased to see that at last we have a body, the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, which has a plan not just for Tasmania, the area I am interested in, but for all Australia. I compliment the authority on its report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I looked at the report I noticed in the overview by the general manager that those people who have been acting illegally are at last being brought to justice. This is long overdue, although I was a bit disturbed to see that prosecutions for suspected quota-related offences under the 1992 plan were unsuccessful. That is most unfortunate. Let us hope that the AFMA can get its act together and start to apprehend these people who are rorting the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The part of the report that I was particularly interested in was the south-east fishery. If I ever had any doubt about the management of advisory committees they have been allayed. I noted in appendix 6 of the report that the chairperson of the committee is none other than the former Attorney-General of Tasmania, the Hon. John Bennett, whom my colleague Senator Abetz would recall. I do not think there could be a more honourable person to chair the South East Trawl Management Advisory Committee and make sure that it worked correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was located in my former electorate office&mdash;it is now occupied by Senator Abetz&mdash;I used to park my car within 10 yards of the wharf. I was very disturbed to see trawlers coming in from New South Wales, South Australia and Victoria to feast upon the boom time of orange roughy trawling. Ships would come in almost under water. They had been out pillaging the aggregations of orange roughy, many of which are 50 years old. I thought then that this fishery would not last too long&mdash;and it has not. Over a couple of years we have seen what could have been a great industry for Tasmania being plundered by pirates from other areas of Australia. I am pleased to see from this report the AFMA noting that, because of declining stocks, measures have been taken to reduce the total allowable catch from 10,000 tonnes to 5,000 tonnes. I have to ask: is it a case of closing the door after the horse has bolted?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further along in the report is another area I have been interested in for a long time&mdash;the Bass Strait scallop fishery. The minister, Senator Collins, told me last night how impressed he has been with scallops. We have a Victorian zone, an intermediate zone and a Tasmanian zone controlled by different state authorities. But the scallop fishery over some considerable time has been absolutely devastated. The scallop industry in Tasmania was once very great but the stocks have been depleted to such an extent that there are hardly any scallops left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The southern bluefin tuna fishery is another example of overexploitation of what potentially could be a great industry. I am pleased to see that the AFMA is taking note of all these concerns and has plans in place. They are set out in the annual report.

<PARA>This report reflects on the work of the Office of Film and Literature Classification, the OFLC, over the last year. It is an ongoing saga in the area of film and literature classification. It really started on a new era in the early 1970s. At that time there were two balancing principles in the area of censorship: that people should have the right to read, see and hear what they like; and that children should be protected. An additional principle was that people should not be offended by material they did not want to see. We have about to operate&mdash;this is a matter the committee has recently looked at&mdash;a national system which has national legislation for the first time, a uniform system of classification across Australia that is agreed to by both federal and state governments. Such a move, we believe, is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our committee on community standards has looked at this particular piece of legislation very thoroughly. We do not have any great concerns with the thrust of the legislation, but we do have a number of concerns about the way in which scrutiny applies in the area of film classification, particularly scrutiny by the parliaments of the nation, and we do have concerns about the staffing of the board and the people who operate the film classification system in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is hard to suggest that there are positive sides to a drought, but I think the story I am about to tell is a positive one. In September I was approached by a lady living in Canberra who had heard about the drought on ABC radio and `wanted to do something'. She told me that women and children were often the forgotten victims and she thought that perhaps she would be able to get some food parcels to them sent from Canberra. Even though Jenny Butt was eager, enthusiastic and determined, little could I have imagined that day in my office that she would have been able to mastermind and develop such a campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural drought relief for women and children has targeted a sometimes forgotten group in the community&mdash;women and children. This campaign had no John Farnham or Ray Martin, no glitzy media stunts&mdash;just a genuine desire to help and a woman who refused to let people say no. She organised bins in supermarkets around Canberra, then enlisted Davids Holdings/Festival for warehousing. She got various community groups on side and transport to the most needy areas. She enlisted friends, and friends of friends, as packers and collectors of bins. One such person is Jill Manning from the Senate office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one place where Jenny failed to get a bin placed at the front door was, regrettably, parliament house. Again, regrettably, the bin she placed in the staff canteen was filled with wrappers and other rubbish. The parcels that have been collected have gone to 110 families in Rocky Glen and to families in Coonabarabran and Quambone. A truckload was delivered to families in Stanthorpe by more volunteers&mdash;the CWA and other rural based groups. Everyone has pitched in to help. She also is now going to Collie, Hermidale and Girilambone. These parcels have had no effect on shopkeepers in rural areas because where these parcels have gone there is no local story and the families cannot afford to travel to get supplies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> just a few excerpts from some of the letters Jenny has received. This one is from Coonabarabran which says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit I don't feel comfortable taking the goods but to be honest it is a great help. Thank you sincerely&mdash;the Rural Drought Relief for Women and Children Group are doing a wonderful job.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes times are difficult at present it is nice to know that someone cares enough to do what you and your helpers have done for many rural families here.</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter from Coonabarabran states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I guess when you and your helpers organised the relief parcels you realised how much they would be appreciated, what you may not realise is that as with me the `relief' would come from the feeling that out there is concern and caring, that feeling means as much if not more than the contents of my parcel.</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter from Coonabarabran says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is just a short note to thank you so much for the Drought Relief Parcel I received yesterday. After looking at the dry land day after day and hungry stock it was nice to have santa come early and put a smile on our faces. Thank you, once again you'll never know how much your parcel was appreciated.</PARA>
<PARA>Another letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So comforting to know someone was thinking of us all during this dreadful drought. Still no relief as far as savings but hoping for good rain soon.</PARA>
<PARA>There are plenty more letters but the last I will quote from is from Stanthorpe again. It says at the end of the letter:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is great to know that the cities do care about us here in the country and all of our 50 families join with me in thanking you once again for the help and compassion you have shown us.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this basically shows that city and country can work together through a problem, just as people did when the earthquake struck Newcastle&mdash;people got in and helped. This particular drought has hurt so many people. People in the city of Canberra have been able to lend a hand and are being ably led by Jenny Butt. This appeal has now spread through Queanbeyan, Tumut, Wagga, Griffith and Bega and is bringing country and city people closer together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the beginning of this speech about Port Hinchinbrook tonight, I really thank Senator Ian Macdonald for causing me to go back and read much more carefully a document today which I had read fairly sketchily this morning. Tonight I want to put some of that document on the record. I found it very interesting to read the same document from which Senator Macdonald quoted this morning and at lunchtime. I think we were reading the same document, but the information I got from it certainly is a very different interpretation, as I read it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The document is the report of the group of scientists called together by Senator Faulkner to look at the seagrass beds and other matters relating to the Hinchinbrook development. The interesting thing, I think, that needs to be said at the very beginning is that the scientists operated within a very narrow framework and were looking at what they term in their document a reactive form of management of the development; in other words, they were given a task to look at what the impact of the development would be. They were never asked to look at whether the development was appropriate or those kinds of questions that I would want to address. Although the guidelines were rather narrow, it is certainly interesting to find that the scientists had many interesting concerns which parallel the concerns I have been expressing here in this place on many occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really would like to put all of the document on the record but do not have the time tonight to do that. Perhaps I will just quote from the conclusion some of the issues that I think are very important. The scientists say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Seagrass beds in the Hinchinbrook Channel are a significant resource and a valuable feature of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area. Scientific evidence indicates that turbidity is a significant factor affecting the growth and the distribution of seagrass communities. There is considerable evidence of tropical seagrass beds being damaged or destroyed by periods of elevated turbidity. There is also evidence that tropical seagrass communities can survive periods of elevated turbidity and recover from disturbance.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to put both sides of the debate because, of course, this is a document which tries to do that. The document continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many of the activities associated with the Port Hinchinbrook development have the potential to significantly increase local turbidity levels. It is therefore vital that site management be of high quality if risks to World Heritage values are to be avoided. Short term risks of large scale sediment mobilisation should be minimised and the timing of various aspects of the construction in relation to the wet season must be carefully considered.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the loss of mangroves the worst case situation would be a significant loss of sediment into the adjacent Channel waters. The Working Group view was that this gives a moderate risk of localised seagrass loss adjacent to the development. However, there would be a high probability of recovery (within about 12 months) if water and sediment conditions return to those existing prior to impact.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important to note that. The document goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the longer term, development of the foreshore requires a foreshore management plan that incorporates sustainable options that control all forms of sediment loss to adjacent waters and meet the needs of site development. It is noted that mangroves provide an effective means of stabilising such foreshores and that the two species that presently comprise the narrow fringe readily coppice and can be trimmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High quality site management is critical to avoiding damage to World Heritage Values. The present state of the site poses a significant erosion hazard with the imminent onset of the wet season.</PARA>
<PARA>That is all that I am able to read in the time available to me. But against that, there is an underlying need for high quality management, and that really is the bottom line in terms of the report and the parts of the report I have read to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to place another document on the record. This is a transcript of an interview between Keith Williams, the developer, and Cathy Job last night on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> in Queensland. I think some of the exchange is very interesting because in at least one of the conversations I had with Mr Williams he claimed to be an environmental expert, particularly because of the fact of his development of the Sea World Resort at Southport and because he had kept dolphins there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the statements Cathy Job made about the report in reply to Mr Williams was:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actually what it does say is if the management is good, there'll be minimal effect, if the management is bad, it could create significant damage and goes on to say&mdash;to put down some guidelines to what should happen to ensure that management is good.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Williams's reply is interesting:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathy, that's just a cover up. The fact of life is the management will be good in any event, because I don't manage things badly. But quite aside from that, if you had no management at all it still couldn't cause any impact.</PARA>

<PARA>A little further on in the interview, this exchange took place:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOB:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But doesn't this report make it quite clear that mangroves shouldn't go.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIAMS:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cathy, I don't care&mdash;I am giving the terms under which I will proceed with this development, and you know everybody can go jump in the creek, I don't really care. If they think mangroves are so bloody precious and so important why don't they insist the Cairns City Council remove every mangrove that pops up along the esplanade for three miles. They don't want them there, and I don't want them at my resort either.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOB:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the report actually says there needs to be a wider look at mangrove removal in the tropics in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIAMS:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yeah I think there needs to be a real wide look, because there's too many of them, and if they keep growing at the rate they are, there won't even be a Hinchinbrook Channel because they'll grow from one side to the other . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And so on. This is the man who is an environmental expert and who says that he is going to manage the development. I am afraid, if his replies to Cathy Job are any indication, I am not sure that he really cares.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">JOB:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Isn't the problem Sen Faulkner has, is he had to act if there's going to be damage, he only knows there's going to be damage if the work is done, and the State Government hasn't done the work&mdash;the baseline studies, to get the data together.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">WILLIAMS:<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That's absolute rubbish. The State Government has gone over the top with their work. Your own program tonight is guilty of showing film of a dugong grazing in clear water, which doesn't exist at Cardwell. You're announcer made an absolutely stupid comment and said if the seagrass is going to take 12 months to regrow, and what are the dugongs going to do for 12 months? If all the seagrass off the Port Hinchinbrook site disappeared overnight, it would mean about one feed a year for one dolphin, and by their own figures, there's only been about 20 dolphins sited in the channel at one time&mdash;the channel's 40 kilometres long.</PARA>

There is a widespread feeling that some of the decisions of the OFLC and the film review board do not properly reflect the wishes of the community. I think this perhaps came out best in an example last year with the classification of the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS>. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Salo</EMPHASIS> would have to be one of the most revolting films ever made. It has been banned in most countries of the world, and it was banned in Australia until last year. Seventeen years ago it was first submitted, and every time it has been submitted since the OFLC has banned it. Its recent decision last year to ban it was overturned by the film review board, and it was at that time that our committee on community standards became increasingly worried about why this sort of thing was happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons is that the people who are on the boards of these various censorship bodies are not, despite the claims of the Chief Censor, in any way representative of the community. The annual report that has just come out lists the people and their occupations. Let us see what people think about how representative this is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The board consists of John Dickie, who was previously a journalist. The Deputy Chief Censor taught drama and media. The Senior Censor, Andree Wright, was a freelance writer. Peter Mackay worked with an adolescent support group&mdash;a little out of the mould of the others. Sarah Morton, however, was a freelance journalist. Sally Stockbridge was a senior tutor, lecturer in film and related studies. Douglas Stewart was a senior lecturer in media studies. Elizabeth Alexander was a public relations officer with the Film Finance Corporation. Jennifer Rae was a senior teacher in Intensive English College. Robert Hellmers was a specialist school counsellor, and Gareth Griffith was a lecturer in legal studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the body of so-called representative people that have been making decisions for the community in this matter. We have had the chief censor and his group claim before us on a number of occasions that their body is representative, but the annual report just laid down gives the lie to that. I raise this matter because the structure of the board has recently undergone review, and the number of members are to be increased from 10 to 20. That is most welcome. But given that the chief censor claimed that the board was previously representative, what will we get this time&mdash;more film critics? Basically, of the 11 people I read out, nine people were either lecturers in journalism or journalists of some particular description. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I submit that that is one of the reasons why some of the decisions of this board and the whole direction of censorship in this country have been out of kilter with community attitudes. It was, therefore, the right move by the community standards committee to suggest a reform of the process to get much better community input. We suggested at the time of our video games report that the whole organisation be restructured, that the chief censor become the chief executive officer of the organisation, that a more representative community board be appointed with membership of only three years, that the deputy chief censor be selected from that number and that there be a wide-ranging group representing the community to review the decisions of that board where there is conflict between the Office of Film and Literature Classification and the Film and Literature Board of Review. The government rejected those recommendations at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee's recent report on the classification bill, we have renewed such recommendations. I emphasise tonight the need for the government to do that because it is only through proper community representation that we will get the correct decisions made by this board. If we do not do that, we will continually find problems in the system. Our select committee was set up in 1991 for about three months to do a task and has now been running for four years. The problems are there because of the wrong structure. If we get the structure right, we will not have to keep setting up committees. I recommend very strongly to the Senate that we make such a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other change that needs to be made, and this relates particularly to what will happen to this classification bill from this point on, is that there needs to be a lot more scrutiny of the whole process by the elected parliament. This report actually lists the guidelines under which the film review board and the Office of Film and Literature Classification work for the different censorship codes. Who makes up those guidelines? They come from the board. How is it scrutinised? It comes in the form of an appendix at the back of an annual report. There is no proper legislative scrutiny. There are no regulations to go through the regulations and ordinances committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We very strongly recommended to the minister in our report&mdash;we are not amending the legislation to do this&mdash;that, if there are any changes to the guidelines on the censorship matters, those changed guidelines lie on the table of the state and federal parliaments so that there is some scrutiny in the process. It is hoped in this way that the excellent system of scrutiny that we have in this country, the system that is set up under the Office of Film and Literature Classification which is taken worldwide to be a leader in the field, will be refined in the ways that I have indicated so that these matters properly reflect the true attitudes of the community and not just a vested interest group. </PARA>

<TITLE>Sugar Industry: Trade Unions</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="3610" SPEAKER="Macdonald Sen I.D." NAMEID="YW4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Queensland)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.45 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise this evening to alert the Senate to some more examples of fairly irresponsible union action, this time in the area of North Queensland where I live. North Queensland is well served and has been for many years by the sugar industry, which is a significant and integral part of the economy of the area. The sugar industry has its ups and downs. In recent years, it has been down. At the moment, it is experiencing very buoyant times. Generally speaking, there has been industrial peace in the sugar industry. However, recently at the height of the sugar season, at a most crucial time, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association went on strike in Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This strike severely interrupted the sugar harvest, closed down the mills and caused losses to cane growers, harvesting contractors, workers and the mills. One might think that this strike could at least be considered in some light if it had something to do with the sugar industry or the conditions of workers. But the strike had absolutely nothing to do with coastal North Queensland and the sugar industry and everything to do with an inter-union demarcation dispute in Mount Isa, hundreds of kilometres away in a mining town. The FEDFA thought that the AWU or something like that&mdash;I do not understand the inter-union politics&mdash;was trying to take over Mount Isa mines. To show that the union still had some authority, it called a strike which affected not only Mount Isa but also the sugar industry. That shows just how rogue unions can disrupt the economy of an area, the livelihoods of people and workers for purely internal political reasons. That was of some concern to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Around that time when I made some comments on that matter in the sugar industry, a number of constituents from the Ingham area approached me regarding another issue which showed an arrogant and bullyboy attitude of unions&mdash;the AWU in this instance&mdash;in the sugar industry. Some cane harvesting contractors and cane farmers had said to their workers, `If you want to join the union, go right ahead, you have our entire support. But it is a free country and if you don't want to join the union, don't bother.' As a result of this, those cane growers and cane harvesting contractors were told that, unless they insisted that their workers took out AWU membership, they and their farmers would be black-banned, no bins would be delivered by the mill to the farm and therefore the farmer would be unable to get his cane off. Mr President, you would be aware that the cane has to be taken off at the time it is ready for harvest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What further disturbed these cane growers and cane harvesting contractors is that they seemed to think that their own organisation of employers was party to that demand by the unions to have compulsory membership of field workers. It turns out on further investigation, so these constituents tell me, that an agreement had been made and an award signed between the cane growers, the cane harvesting contractors and the AWU providing for preference and, put in other language, compulsory membership for field workers in the sugar industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has been running quite strongly in the community of Ingham, which is just north of Townsville and a very wealthy sugar growing area, since it came to the fore. Many letters have been written to and a lot of articles have been published in the local paper. The matter was raised in the Queensland parliament by my friend and colleague the National Party member for Hinchinbrook, Mr Marc Rowell. Petitions were lodged and statements issued by the cane growers and cane harvesting contractors who thought it inappropriate that they had to force their workers to take out union membership. They distributed quite widely a letter to friends and neighbours, as they referred to them. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue is not against Unions or members of Unions. This is a sad story of betrayal by the people we entrusted with authority to represent us at the HIGHEST LEVEL to protect our rights and ensure the best conditions for all Canegrowers and their workers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When an agreement concerning the free choice of Canegrowers and their Fieldworkers is made which eliminates those free choices then it is a Violation of the Charter of Human Rights sacred to the United Nations to which Australia is signatory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THIS IS WHY WE ARE PROTESTING!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Canegrowers and Harvester Owners are hard working, peace loving people and when told anyone could pay the fees to avoid trouble, many of them did so, not realising that that too was a violation of the rights of their employees!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Charter Of Human Rights guarantees that no person can be forced to become a member of any group or organisation AGAINST HIS FREE WILL.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">THIS IS WHY WE ARE FIGHTING!</PARA>
<PARA>Some further work by a group of cane growers and, in many instances, their wives, who took a very strong line on this, resulted in getting a petition together which was signed by a number of people and I understand tabled in the Queensland parliament. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. WE CONDEMN THE MISREPRESENTATION OF CANEGROWERS IN THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN EXECUTIVES AND THE A.W.U. TO IMPOSE COMPULSORY UNIONISM UPON WORKERS IN THE CANEFIELDS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. WE CONDEMN THE HARASSMENT, INTIMIDATION AND BLACKMAIL BY THE ABOVE AGAINST MEMBERS OF THE CANEGROWERS AND THEIR EMPLOYEES.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. WE CONDEMN BONDAGE AS A MEANS OF UNION RECRUITMENT AND OBTAINING FUNDS BY EXTORTION FOR UNIONS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. WE CONDEMN THE VIOLATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS AGAINST THE EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES IN THE AGREEMENT ENFORCED BY THE ABOVE.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. WE INSIST THAT UNION MEMBERSHIP BE VOLUNTARY SO THAT NO EMPLOYEE IN THE CANEFIELDS WILL EVER BE SUBJECTED TO BONDAGE BY DECEIT, DISHONESTY, OR POLITICAL AGENDA&mdash;BY ANY PERSON REPRESENTING THE CANEGROWERS ASSO CIATION.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Those people were very concerned and, as you can tell, Mr President, quite angry at the way this happened. They were, as I say, very angry with the union. They were also annoyed with their own union of employers, which they thought was pushing the union membership. In fact, a number of letters were written to cane growers and cane harvesters by the cane growers organisation which indicated that the cane growers and cane harvesting contractors should insist that their employees take out membership or pay for it themselves. One of the letters which were sent to cane growers states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this contact is to make you aware that harvesting of your cane will be delayed unless your contractor takes immediate action to have his employees obtain Union tickets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid your cane being placed at risk, it is recommended that you immediately contact your harvesting contractor in regard to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>A similar letter went to the cane harvesting contractors. Those people are quite concerned. I raise these matters at the request of the constituents in Ingham who feel that they have been blackmailed by the unions to the extent where they, the people who contacted me, had to give in. They went out and paid with their own money&mdash;they were not worried about the money&mdash;the membership to the cane growers organisation, which we understand then reindorsed the cheques for them to be paid over to the union movement. Those people were forced to do that or they would have lost their cane. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Albanian officials arrested six members of the ethnic Greek political party Omonia on 18 April 1994. The six were arrested on charges of treason, espionage and illegal possession of arms, irrespective of their Omonia membership. The most serious charge of treason was later dropped, and a further scaling down of charges was made in regard to one of the six who was accused only of illegal possession of arms. The Australian Government respects the right of Albanian judicial authorities to act independently but retains the strong expectation that, in line with Albania's declared espousal of democratic principles, all those accused of crimes will receive fair and open trials which comply fully with the international rule of law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Greek Government accused Albanian officials of mistreating and violating the rights of the six accused. The Albanian Government has steadfastly denied these accusations, which were made against a backdrop of severe tensions in the bilateral relationship arising from mutual allegations of minority mistreatment and recriminations such as the deportation of 40-50,000 Albanians from Greece and Albania's refusal to allow Greece to replace the military attache at its Embassy in Tirana. From the outset, the Albanian Government declared that the accused would receive a fair and open trial. To this end, invitations were issued to Greek Embassy staff in Tirana to attend the trial and the Ambassador, accompanied by an all-Party Greek Parliamentary delegation, took up the offer. A representative of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe visited Albania during the trial and declared that the trial procedure had been normal and independent of Albanian Government influence. During one of his regular visits to Albania in August 1994&mdash;while the trial was in progress&mdash;Australia's Ambassador in Rome (accredited to Albania) met with Albanian Foreign Ministry officials and outlined Australia's expectation that the six Greek/Albanians would receive a fair and open trial. During a previous visit to Albania in February 1994, the Ambassador registered in meetings with President Berisha, Deputy Prime Minister Kopliku and Foreign Minister Serreqi Australia's policy of global concern for the protection and observance of human rights and our strong hope that Albania's political and economic reforms would proceed in line with all democratic norms.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Yes. The Government is aware that the Victorian Deaf Society is experiencing financial difficulties in the operation of its TTY relay service.

The Government is concerned to ensure that the users of these services are not disadvantaged by the establishment of the new national service. To this end, the new national service is being designed to enhance the quality of service available.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) to (15) It is a long-established practice of Australian governments not to comment on intelligence and security matters. It is therefore not my intention to discuss the specific functions and capabilities of the Australian Defence Satellite Communications Station at Geraldton. However, I can confirm that the station is operated by the Defence Signals Directorate (DSD) of the Department of Defence. DSD's role and functions were set out in the Prime Minister's statement of 22 May 1985 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, page 2886).</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">undertook to provide detailed answers at a later date. The answers are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government is totally opposed to the use of coercion in family planning programs. We have indeed recently revised our procedures for appraising and evaluating population activities to ensure that they promote basic human rights. At the same time the Government would acknowledge that on some occasions overzealous local officials may engage in practices which are not sanctioned by the Australian Government. However, in such cases the choice for us is very clear. Australia either stays involved in the program to ensure that such practices are eliminated in favour of a more enlightened and humanitarian approach, or we withdraw completely, thereby ceasing to be able to demonstrate the efficacy of voluntarism. This Government has chosen the former approach.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to Senator Harradine's specific concerns I have the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I have now seen wire service reports quoting the Bishop of Dili, Ximenes Belo. The reports&mdash;run by AAP on October 19 and Lisbon Radio on 18 October&mdash;indicate that Bishop Belo may have confused the use of contraceptives such as Norplant and Depo Provera as equivalent to permanent sterilisation. This is not the case.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Embassy in Jakarta has advised that the Government of Indonesia recognises the following contraceptive options; injectables, condoms, Billings method, IUD, oral contraceptive pill, spermicides and Norplant. In East Timor, it is reported that the provincial government strongly promotes the use of "natural" family planning methods due to the predominance of Roman Catholics in the Province.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UNICEF and UNFPA offices have indicated that they have no knowledge or evidence to support claims of coercive sterilisation or forced contraception campaigns in East Timor. UNICEF works in all districts in East Timor and is well placed to speak authoritatively on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The article referred to by the Senator in the June 1994 edition of Inside Indonesia is titled "Family Planning: the Health of the State". The anonymous author is critical of the Indonesian family planning system in West Sumatra claiming that it is `highly invasive and coercive, and underpinned by an extensive system of surveillance and control'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Family Planning Program (KB) was introduced in the area 12 years ago. Though the limited number of women quoted by this article appear to have had bad experiences with Family Planning authorities in the area, the author concludes that most women in the area surveyed were still interested in gaining access to high quality family planning services. Australia is keen to assist the Indonesian Government in achieving this goal&mdash;ensuring that services currently enjoyed by women who can afford to attend private clinics are extended to all poor women. It is through the provision of high quality services that women are guaranteed the right to information and autonomy called for in the article. It will not be achieved by withdrawing support for programs in Indonesia where maternal mortality is still estimated at 425 per 100,000 live births.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to point out that the author of the article is incorrect in asserting that Depo Provera is banned except for `experimental uses' in the US. Depo Provera is available legally in the US as a contraceptive. It is also available legally as a contraceptive in Australia and almost all western countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Under the agreement between Minister Bilney and the Indonesian State Minister for Population, Haryono Suyono, Australia agreed to assist family </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">planning officials from Papua New Guinea and several Pacific Island countries to participate in Observation Study Tours (OST) of Indonesian family planning operational and training facilities. The objective is to improve the quality of family planning and safe motherhood services in Papua New Guinea and Pacific Island countries. It is up to the participating countries to decide on whether such visits are helpful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these OST's took place in May 1994. Australian Embassy staff attended some of the training sessions and noted that the Indonesian officials did not attempt to enforce particular views on participants. Our information indicates that South Pacific participants told Embassy staff that they found the program useful in forming their own views on the provision of community based family planning services.</PARA>
