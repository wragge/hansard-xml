The government accepted that recommendation.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the very real progress that was made at COAG towards implementing free and fair interstate trade in natural gas. Such an agreement was a long time coming. The matter has been on the COAG agenda now for some years, and I am pleased that it was brought to a resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Free and fair trade in natural gas, including arrangements for third party access to pipelines, represents one of the key objectives of the federal government's national gas strategy. The COAG decision means that arrangements will now be put in place to allow gas consumers and producers in any state or territory to buy or sell gas in any other state or territory on normal commercial terms. This will lead to the best possible use of Australia's gas resources and the lowest possible prices for consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">COAG's approach will also stimulate development of a truly national gas industry by increasing the market area and doing away with artificial regulatory barriers at state borders, which is obviously a sensible arrangement for a geographically diffuse nation which is rich in natural gas. As a consequence of the COAG agreement, I announced at the weekend that the Interstate Gas Pipelines Bill, which is currently before this Senate, will be deferred. The bill, which was introduced late last year, was designed to address many of the commercial transparency and third party access issues that have now been agreed upon in Hobart. The eventual fate of the bill will rest with how readily state and territory governments move to implement the decisions that were reached by COAG. However, I expect the goodwill and commitment demonstrated in Hobart to carry over into action and the agreed national framework to be in place by the deadline of 1 July 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreed features of this framework to be put into place are as follows: no legislative or regulatory barriers to interstate and intrastate trade in gas; third party access rights to both interstate and intrastate supply networks; uniform national pipeline construction standards; increased commercialisation of the operations of publicly owned gas utilities; no restrictions on the uses of natural gas&mdash;for example, for electricity generation; and, finally, gas franchise arrangements consistent with free and fair competition in the gas market and third party access.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the minister's recent appearance on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> when he claimed that the Parliamentary Privileges Act of 1987, which was introduced by him into the Senate at that time, had never contemplated that parliament should be allowed to impose penalties, including gaol, on public servants. Could he therefore please explain why in 1984 the report of the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Privilege, which was the basis for the 1987 legislation and of which committee he was then the deputy chairman, said, `For the system to work effectively it must have the power to compel the attendance of witnesses . . . and the production of documents . . . We think the sanction of imprisonment should remain'? Why has the minister once again changed his story to suit his political convenience?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is only one person displaying any mania at the moment, and it is not me. I remember very clearly the context of that Senate committee inquiry because I was a member of it, as Senator Alston says. Clearly what we were concerned about was that there be an appropriate set of sanctions to deal with breaches of privilege. This could, in an appropriate situation, involve non-cooperation of witnesses in various ways. Unquestionably the main context in which we thought it was not only desirable but indeed necessary to maintain the sanction was, as I said the other day, in the context of gross intimidation of parliamentarians, or intimidation or standing over of witnesses, or some other extreme manifestation of behaviour of that kind which would make it totally inappropriate for the behaviour in question to go unpunished&mdash;and punished in an extreme way, not just a slap over the wrist.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be remembered that the context of that privileges committee inquiry was also one in which the committee was at pains to recommend, and the parliament agreed, that there should no longer be any offence of defamation of parliament or parliamentarians, which was the context, of course, in which imprisonment had been handed out in that disgraceful case of Browne and Fitzpatrick back in the 1950s. But in the context of other possible breaches of privilege and in particular the extreme ones, the situation is as I described it. I cannot recall a single conversation in that committee which in any way had regard to&mdash;let alone came forward with an explicit recommendation&mdash;the possibility of public servants being imprisoned for acting in accordance with legitimate executive directions in this matter.</PARA>

The minister was on that committee for several years, he was indeed the deputy chairman in opposition, and remained on that committee as deputy chairman when he was Attorney-General through to 1984. Is he seriously telling the Senate that he was not then conscious of the 1975 privileges resolution which said that the fact that a person summonsed is an officer of the Public Service or that a question related to his departmental duties does not of itself excuse or preclude an officer from answering the question or from producing a file? Is he seriously saying that that was not clearly in contemplation, that he was not fully aware of that, and therefore when he told <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> that it had never been contemplated that legislation should apply to allow parliament to service its privileges in that way, he was simply once again, last Sunday, disguising the real truth?</PARA></TALK.START>

I on occasion, I have to readily concede, as I did in this place the other day, have been party in the past to some of those misconceived exercises when I have been an exuberant advocate in opposition. But when one is in government and one has the role of not only being an advocate but a judge on matters that go directly to the public interest one grows up.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15 February 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FORMER YUGOSLAV REPUBLIC OF MACEDONIA (FYROM)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has decided to recognise as an independent state, and to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Australia will refer to the Republic as "The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" (FYROM), the temporary name used in the UN and for membership of some international agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FYROM has been formally recognised by some 59 states (including, last week, the United States of America). Along with 62 other countries, including Greece, Australia co-sponsored the admission of the FYROM to the UN in April 1993. According to the practice of many of those co-sponsors, recognition of the FYROM flowed automatically from support for its admission to the UN; for Australia, recognition required a separate formal act, and that step has now been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I assured the Greek Government during my visit to Athens last month, in recognising the FYROM, Australia makes no presumption as to the final outcome of the "name" issue, or any other issue involved in negotiations between Greece and the Republic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do believe those negotiations would be much assisted by the Government in Skopje ceasing to use the "Star of Vergina" symbol on the FYROM's flag; forbearing from using the name "Republic of Macedonia" until a mutually acceptable final resolution of the name issue is achieved; addressing the provisions of FYROM's Constitution which continue to cause concern in Greece; and taking all possible steps to curb the proliferation, at home and abroad, of offensive irredentist propaganda. We urge the Government of the FYROM to act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government also stands ready to enter into diplomatic relations with the FYROM, joining, among many others in this respect, all of Greece's major European partners. We will consider a request from the authorities in Skopje to open a Consulate in Australia which will be able to provide a full range of needed consular services to the local community (some 75,000 people) in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have instructed the Australian Embassy in Belgrade to pursue the necessary practical arrangements. Our agreement to the opening of a FYROM Consulate in Australia would be subject to the conditions that it describe itself appropriately (as the Consulate of the "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia", not as the "Republic of Macedonia"), and that no contentious flag or other symbol be displayed pending final resolution of relevant outstanding issues. Our early agreement to the opening of a Consulate would be much assisted by a statement on the public record by the Government of the FYROM that it is prepared to act immediately, or at least as soon as the necessary legislative majority is achievable, to change the country's flag.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 3 March 1992, Prime Minister Keating identified three matters about which Australia would need to be satisfied before proceeding to recognition. We believe, in the light of the course of events since then and our discussions with relevant governments, that these conditions are now met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the first of these matters&mdash;"the use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in the way that does not cause further tension with Greece"&mdash;the situation is that while the name issue has still not been finally resolved, it has been satisfactorily settled for the time being by the international community (including Greece itself accepting for various purposes the temporary name "Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the second matter&mdash;"Greece's concern about possible territorial claims or aspirations being fully met"&mdash;the amendment to the FYROM's Constitution in July 1992 (spelling out that the country "has no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states"), together with President Gligorov's restatements (most recently on 10 February 1994) of Skopje's acceptance of existing boundaries between the two countries, has reinforced the earlier conclusion of the Badinter Commission that FYROM had no territorial aspirations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And as to the third matter&mdash;"the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied"&mdash;the recognition action now taken by so many European and other countries has signified acceptance of the Badinter Commission's findings that FYROM's constitutional guarantees on human rights are comparable with the rest of Europe and satisfy recognition standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government is pleased to note the calmer and more constructive atmosphere that has been apparent, in recent times, in discussion of the issues which remain outstanding between Greece and the FYROM. The fact that the two states are geographical neighbours makes it necessary that they be able to deal with each other on a daily basis with mutual respect and confidence. We hope and expect that it will be possible for the outstanding issues to be amicably resolved in the not too distant future.</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While I have not got the time to go through all the detail now, I will state the key elements underlying the government's recognition decision in these terms. In the first place Australian recognition of states is based not on approval or disapproval but on objective criteria. Those criteria&mdash;identifiable boundaries, an established government and a measure of international acceptance of the country as a state&mdash;have clearly been satisfied for some time in the case of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it was simply no longer tenable for Australia to hold out any longer against recognition when 58 other countries, including all the other countries of the European Union and most recently the United States, had recognised the country. It was not a matter of our blindly following the United States, but rather acknowledging the reality that once the United States had moved on this issue no policy leverage of any useful kind could be exercised by withholding recognition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, once the Former Yugoslav Republic was admitted to the UN last year, with Greece itself co-sponsoring that admission and Greece itself accepting for this purpose the temporary name `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', or FYROM, it was inevitable that international recognition would follow. Fourthly, Mr Peacock, the opposition spokesman, squarely accepted this in his own statement that he put out on behalf of the opposition on 15 February when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Honourable. Andrew Peacock, today acknowledged that Australia's decision to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an independent state was consistent with that state's membership of the United Nations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He then went on to give a flick against Mr Keating, yes, but he acknowledged the basic consistency and inevitability. Because he is a crude and vulgar politician, like the rest of the opposition, he could not stop himself there. But on the basic issue he acknowledged the inevitability, he acknowledged the consistency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the terms of Australia's recognition have been terms that bent over backwards to meet the concern of Greek community leaders. In particular, a FYROM consulate will only be able to be opened in Australia if it describes itself appropriately, not as the `Republic of Macedonia', and if it does not display the Star of Vergina or any other contentious symbol.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, let me say this: there are two bottom lines for the Australian government in this matter which should be clearly appreciated by all of those who are determined, for whatever motives, honourable or otherwise, to pursue the politics of division in this country. First, the Australian government will always conduct Australia's foreign policy to protect and advance Australia's national interests, not those of any other country. Secondly, this government will always govern for all Australians in a way which seeks to protect and assist members of all minority groups in our community, not just those who shout or threaten the loudest.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Shadow Minister for Foreign Affairs, Honourable. Andrew Peacock, today acknowledged that Australia's decision to recognise the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an independent state was consistent with that state's membership of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Mr Peacock said the Government's approach was nevertheless flawed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Peacock said he has reservations about the Government's formal diplomatic use, even on a temporary basis, of the name `The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Peacock said he does not accept the Government's claim that all three of the conditions for recognition laid down by Prime Minister Keating on 3 March 1992 have been met. He said the Government has effectively broken the Prime Minister's undertaking not to proceed to recognition until basic outstanding questions are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's first condition was that `the use of the word "Macedonia" be settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the use of the word `Macedonia' is by no means settled. Mr Peacock noted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, had reiterated on 18 January that Greece would not accept the inclusion of `Macedonia' or any derivative in the `neighbouring state's name'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Formal diplomatic use of this name by Australia could cause further tension with Greece, Mr Peacock said. This was clearly demonstrated by Greek Foreign Minister Venizelos' sharply negative reaction on 10 February to the US decision to recognise `The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Peacock considers, despite the Government's protestations to the contrary, that even temporary use of the word `Macedonia' is necessarily presumptive of the outcome of any negotiations on the issue between Athens and Skopje.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nor has Mr Keating's second condition been met. The Greek Government's approach to the issue has been more constructive in recent weeks, Mr Peacock said. But the fact is that when speaking in the Greek Parliament on 24 January, Greek Prime Minister Papandreou made it quite clear that Greece's concerns have not yet been fully met and for this reason, Athens has not yet resumed UN sponsored talks with Skopje.</PARA>

It would be a bit rich for the AMA to claim that now, given that it walked out of the process in 1985. A relative value study is currently proceeding but it walked out on the process in 1985. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, I am not and could not be against highly skilled, highly trained doctors who provide services to Australians being well remunerated. I also have to say that the great majority of doctors&mdash;more than two-thirds&mdash;choose not to exploit their market power; but one third does. A minority of them exploit their position and do so shamelessly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Lawson and Mr Kevin Forde from the University of New South Wales released data today which proves what I have been saying. They reveal that in 1991-92, 42 specialists received more than $700,000 in Medicare benefits alone&mdash;apart from the compensation work and everything else. In that same year, Medicare paid more than $300,000 to 31.4 per cent of dermatologists, 22 per cent of ophthalmic surgeons, 22 per cent of ENT specialists, 25 per cent of cardiologists, and so the list goes on. Of course, those are the specialities where the gap of 30 per cent is most common. The top quarter of ophthalmologists earn around $597,000 a year every year. The top quarter of ear, nose and throat specialists earn $593,000 a year every year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental point in my announcement that the AMA opposes is that this puts a brake on the outrageous out of pocket costs charged by some specialists. Dr Nelson's answer is that those doctors should simply inform their patients what they are going to charge. That has been AMA policy for a long time, but the problem is that certain doctors have ignored it time and time again and will continue to do so. Perhaps now is the time for the AMA to acknowledge that greed has been a major factor in killing private health insurance&mdash;the greed of a small minority of surgeons and specialists. They should learn that the quality of the doctor-patient relationship is about more than the untrammelled right to bill as they see fit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. It follows the question asked of him by Senator Burns, who, I note with interest, asked it as a Queensland senator; I was surprised that it did not come from Victoria. I refer the minister to the Prime Minister's statement on 3 March 1992 in which he said `Australia will not proceed to recognition' of what was then known as the Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia until three basic pre-conditions were met. I ask the minister: why did he, on 15 February, announce that the Keating government had decided to recognise that republic, despite the fact that at least two of the government's basic three conditions had quite clearly not been met? I also ask whether he can understand the strong sense of betrayal felt by the Greek Australian community as a result of the actions of the Australian government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the outset, the Australian government has understood the degree of emotion which exists in Greece and in the Greek community in Australia about this issue and, in particular, about those unacceptable aspects of the Skopje government's behaviour over recent years. In particular, I refer to the unacceptable appropriation of Macedonian cultural symbols&mdash;the Star of Vergina conspicuous among them. Also, we have always regarded it as quite appropriate that the name of the country be resolved in a way that satisfies the aspirations of both countries. There are relatively easily understood ways through that particular dilemma&mdash;for example, by the use of some hyphenated name such as Vardar-Macedonia, or the name Northern Macedonia, or something of that kind&mdash;which the international community has been pressing upon both parties, so far without much success.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make it clear that there has been no resiling from the three conditions that were set. The first condition identified by Mr Keating was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the word `Macedonia' being settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece.</PARA>
<PARA>The situation is that while the name issue has, obviously, not been finally resolved, it has been satisfactorily settled for the time being by the international community, including Greece itself, accepting the temporary name `Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia', as an appropriate basis for the admission of that country into the United Nations. Of course, the rest of the international community has acted on that particular understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question of further tension associated with that, I discussed the issue directly with the Greek government when I was in Athens and I have made the judgment that a statement of this kind by us at this time in the context of the international recognition that has occurred, and using that temporary name, would not add further to the tensions with the Greek government in that respect. That was that particular criterion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the question about Greece's concerns about its territorial claims or aspirations, the amendment to the FYROM  constitution in July 1992, after Mr Keating's original statement which spelt out in constitutional terms that the country had no territorial pretensions towards any neighbouring states, together with a number of restatements since then by President Gligorov of FYROM's intentions in this respect, most recently on 10 February, together with the conclusions of the earlier Badinter commission that FYROM had no territorial aspirations, in my judgment, and that of Mr Keating and the government as a whole, represents a satisfaction of that second condition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the third condition, the international community's concern about the protection of minorities being fully satisfied, the recognition action which has now been taken by so many European and indeed other countries right around the world&mdash;at the conclusion of this answer I will seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a list of the countries that have acted to recognise in this respect&mdash;has signified acceptance by all those countries, including us, of, again, the Badinter commission's findings that FYROM's constitutional guarantees on human rights and the rights of minorities are absolutely comparable with those applicable in the rest of Europe and do satisfy recognition standards.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again repeat that this is a delicate and sensitive issue in which it has to be understood that there is right on both sides; certainly right in terms of the basic responses of the Greek government and community, but also on the part of the other government and those 75,000 people of Slavic or northern Macedonian or former Yugoslavian/Macedonian descent who have been denied access to consular services by this continuing stand-off. There is also the question that Australian foreign policy has to be conducted with credibility and consistency. We believe that all those objectives have been met.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have condemned without reservation this act of utter, appalling insanity, aimed at killing innocent Arab people and with the potential effect of destroying the whole peace process. Tragic though the bloodshed is, it would be an even greater tragedy if the peace which has so long eluded Israelis and Palestinians were to be jeopardised in this way by one man's hatred.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this time of heightened emotion, it is of the utmost importance that Israelis and Palestinians alike exercise restraint so that extremists of all kinds are not further encouraged. We certainly welcome the unqualified condemnation of this brutal act by Israel's Prime Minister and his government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe, however, that it is the responsibility of Israel, as the occupying power, to do all it can to prevent the recurrence of such acts. We welcome Israel's decision to establish an inquiry into the massacre and reports that Israel will move to disarm the most violent of the Jewish settlers and arrest their leaders. We also very warmly welcome moves to set free up to 1,000 Palestinian detainees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubtful, however, that these moves will in themselves be sufficient to restart negotiations immediately, although it is reassuring that both sides have accepted President Clinton's invitation to attend continuous negotiations in Washington. This means that the Washington talks, when they begin, will subsume technical negotiations which have until now been proceeding separately in Washington, Paris and Egypt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PLO has demanded, among other things, that Israel disarm all settlers in the territories, that Israel accept the presence of international peacekeepers in the occupied territories and that the issue of settlements in the territories be placed on the negotiating agenda immediately. We understand as to the question of international peacekeepers that this may be considered by the Security Council, but we also know that the United States as well as, of course, Israel itself have serious reservations about this idea. It is not yet clear how the further disarming of settlers or the wider question of settlements will be addressed in these negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The declaration of principles that was signed last September provides that settlements are to be discussed as part of the permanent status talks scheduled to begin no later than the beginning of the third year after the completion of Israel's withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho. But might I say in that respect that we do feel there is a strong onus on Israel to ensure that its citizens do not commit provocative acts which could further imperil the peace process and to act within the limit of its power and capacity to ensure that that happens.</PARA>

I wanted centres to know that they have my assurance that I am interested in getting the accreditation process up and running. Indeed, I am interested in doing away with the confusion and the division in the community about this, and I wanted to give the centres that kind of clarification so that they could now, if they had any reservations at all, have that assurance and proceed to the accreditation process.</PARA>

This will increase Coflexip's global production by about 25 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coflexip's decision to locate this plant in Australia shows its confidence in Australia as a base from which to supply export markets in the burgeoning Asia and Pacific region.

To gain this new facility, Australia had to beat a determined counter offer from Singapore.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision reflects a concerted effort on the part of several Commonwealth agencies&mdash;Austrade, the investment promotion unit within Treasury and my department&mdash;to consult closely with Coflexip in its assessment of Australia as a location for the new facility.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is owed US$482 million for wheat sold to Iraq prior to the imposition of United Nations trade sanctions in 1990. The Australian Wheat Board has already been reimbursed US$382 million under their Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC) national interest insurance policy. Converted to Australian dollars at the exchange rates prevailing at the times the reimbursements on individual contracts were made, this amounted to $A496 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sharing of the risk, 80% Commonwealth and 20% AWB, and in some cases 70% Commonwealth and 30% AWB reflects the contractual agreements reached for the provision for insurance cover for these sales under the national interest facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AWB has an exposure to Iraqi debt of US$99 million relating to equity in the 1987/88, 1988/89 and the 1989/90 wheat pools. None of this debt has been written off. At an exchange rate of $A1 to US$0.72 this exposure amounts to $A138 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Iraq has undertaken to repay all of this debt as soon as it is able to do so. Its ability to repay will depend on when the United Nations decides to lift its sanctions on Iraq.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the government has paid the grains industry $33 million to cover losses on sales of wheat, rice and yellow split peas contracted prior to the imposition of the United Nations trade sanctions on Iraq (in August 1990), and associated costs in re-selling those commodities to alternative markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The equity relating to Iraqi debt in the 1987/88 (US$4 million) and 1988/89 (US$42 million) pools was transferred to the 1990/91 pool at a nominal amount to allow the closure of these pools. The equity relating to Iraqi debt was placed in a separate account. The AWB has advised growers that a record of their entitlements in these pools will be maintained for at least 3 years and any payments from Iraq received during that time will be paid to the growers concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian growers are carrying the balance of their exposure to Iraqi debt as equity in the 1989/90 pool worth some US$53 million. The Australian Wheat Board is currently considering the options available to close this pool.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the further answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Loosley on 23 February 1994, relating to an inquiry in the Australian Security Intelligence Service.</PARA>
<PARA>I have just received the press release issued by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and I thank him for it. While mine will not be the considered response that will be made by Mr Peacock, who now has responsibility for the ASIS on our side, I wish to make a few preliminary comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, there really has been an astonishing sequence of events.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">You will remember that at 2.00 p.m. on 22 February during question time Senator Evans said he had total faith not only in ASIS but also in the safeguards that existed to ensure proper and adequate accountability. At an estimates hearing later that same evening Senator Evans said that he had concerns about ASIS and that for some weeks he had been considering whether there should be what he described as a root and branch inquiry into ASIS. That was totally inconsistent with what he had said earlier in the day. The following day during question time he came in here and said, yes, he was going to have his inquiry into ASIS and today he tells us some more details about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from my concern about the fact that Senator Evans's answer in this place on 22 February was totally misleading, I have obvious concerns about the announcement that he has made. Firstly, he told us on 22 February that he was looking at a root and branch inquiry because the whole circumstances of our security apparatus had changed in the post-Cold War era and there had to be an examination in the light of those changed circumstances. Yet, when we see this document today, we find that the functions and priorities of ASIS will not be looked at at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You were questioned on that in the estimates and that was taken into account in your answer when you said that nevertheless there now needs to be a root and branch inquiry more akin to the previous royal commission. In other words, it referred to looking at the functions and priorities as well as the internal management issues. Senator Evans has come in here the following week and apparently abandoned that idea. I do not know whether that was his notion or it has been pressed upon him.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I am not. Anybody can go back and read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Senator Evans has to explain why he changed his mind between the night of the 22nd and today as to whether or not it was necessary in the post-Cold War period to examine the functional role and priorities of ASIS. It is now said that it is not necessary because there has been an internal inquiry into that in the last few years. I would have thought that it was appropriate, as Senator Evans seemed to think on the night of the 22nd, for, in fact, this examination to consider those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, I would have thought that this inquiry would also investigate the allegations made and aired publicly concerning both alleged operational improprieties and, also, clearly,  irregularities in the dealings between ASIS and its servants, its staff. Yet, when looked at, it is all about what ought to be the arrangements for the future, rather than an examination of the very serious allegations made to find, in fact, whether they were well founded. That is what we are interested in, because if they are we can be extremely concerned about the way in which this important security operation has carried out its business and about the lack of supervision it apparently had from its minister, Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operational allegations in the press would have to be described as somewhat exotic. We would have tended to dismiss them but for the fact that the allegations made about the handling of the staff of ASIS by ASIS and through the ministerial chain of command have, in fact, been demonstrated to be well-founded. In fact, the Inspector-General has referred to improper ways of investigating grievances of the staff of ASIS, and found they have been dealt with in ways that have not respected the principles of natural justice. That does not seem to concern the minister, but certainly concerns this side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wider concern just mentioned is that if these complaints are being demonstrated to be soundly based through the work of the Inspector-General in relation to staff grievances, one can only suspect perhaps there may be some truth in some of the other allegations concerning operational matters. If that is so, we in this country should be seriously worried. Yet, I cannot find in these terms of reference a specific instruction to the Hon. Gordon Samuels to examine whether or not those allegations are correct and, in particular if they are, who is at fault and where the accountability should lie. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trouble is that we do not know of the internal goings on of this organisation, and neither should we. But that does mean the minister himself has a major responsibility. He is ultimately responsible as minister for ASIS under his umbrella portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am surprised that is not explicitly set down in these terms of reference and the relationship with ASIS and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is not also specifically included. As the minister knows from a press release of Mr Peacock, this is an area that has been of public concern for some time. I am astonished that the minister has not specifically included an examination of that within his terms of reference. Although I would have liked to have seen specifically in the terms of reference who should have been accepting ultimate responsibility for these matters and, in particular, what should be the ministerial responsibility, it is not surprising that that has not been included either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I am concerned about the implied threats to former ASIS officers that are included within the last sentence of this press release. They are threatened that if public statements do not cease the government will, where necessary `take firm and prompt action in the interests of national security'. As a result of the comments that have been made the government has felt that it should set up an inquiry of this nature under the Hon. Gordon Samuels. To that extent these statements have already been vindicated. As far as they relate to personnel grievances, they have been vindicated not only by the fact that an inquiry has been set up but by the findings of the Inspector-General, as have been reported in his annual report. Against that background, to find that the minister has to resort to threats in this last paragraph is disappointing. </PARA>

It is disgraceful for this sort of calumny to come from the other side and to be threatened that Mr Peacock's reply will address this. As anyone who knows Mr Maxwell and his qualities as a barrister will confirm, he is simply someone of outstanding capacity. Moreover, he is a junior and will cost the Commonwealth less in this respect than having a silk, with everything associated with that. He is someone who knows a little about the background to this by virtue of his previous experience and will do an outstanding job. I am absolutely delighted that he has accepted it. It is really quite disgraceful that we should get this sort of interjection from Senator Alston and that sort of statement from Senator Hill. But it is par for the course, and I suppose it is what we have got to expect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the second last point that was made about the government's statement in relation to certain individuals who have been going public with their grievances about ASIS, the government has very serious and very onerous responsibilities in the protection of national security and the protection of the national interests in this respect. We will carry out those responsibilities with full consciousness of the gravity of the issues that are involved. It is most unfortunate that the opposition should choose to trivialise and to score points about something which is obviously an example of the government properly exercising its various serious responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn quickly to some of the other points that were made in this scatter-gun collection of misstatements from Senator Hill. He said at the outset that in my responses to the Senate estimates committee I had clearly intimated that if an inquiry were to be held it would address the question of the role, the functions and the priorities of the service. I said absolutely nothing of the kind. I challenge Senator Hill to find any explicit language in the estimates committee hearing to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did say that, given the postwar environment, the new priorities, the new kinds of roles, the newly configured responsibilities of ASIS and the other intelligence organisations, and the additional funding that had been made available to the organisation over the last two years, there was certainly a case for looking closely at its organisation and management. That is something that I had been giving consideration to over the last few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second point I was making in the estimates committee hearing, and I make again, is that in the post-Cold War environment, where the atmospherics have changed and the ground rules have changed in many ways, there is certainly a case for looking afresh at questions of control and accountability so far as these secret organisations are concerned and in particular, for example, looking at the question of whether or not their role might not be better governed by statute than by some form of executive direction. That is clearly one of the issues that will be addressed by the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further consideration flowing from the end of the Cold War and the change in the psychological climate that governed security matters in relation to that is that it is appropriate, again as I said at the estimates committee, to look again at the protective mechanisms that apply in relation to these organisations and, in particular, for example, the voluntary restraint arrangements through D notices. The environment has changed, the atmosphere has changed. The apparent willingness of news organisations to comply with those voluntary constraints seems to have changed as well&mdash;unhappily&mdash;and it is important that that issue in that context be revisited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as to the question of the specific grievances that particular people have had in relation to personnel matters, I repeat what I have said previously: I am fully confident about the way in which those issues have been handled by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security who was appointed for that very purpose to deal with these sorts of matters. Mr President, I can hardly hear myself talk over the sound of the transmission from the other chamber. Is it orderly for that to occur?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the Inspector-General's investigations of these grievances, I have full confidence, as I say and I repeat, in his investigations into those particular grievances, and it is not proposed to revisit them. However, if particular lessons can be learnt from the way in which that process worked in those cases, it is entirely appropriate that the inquiry address itself to them in that way. That is the point that is made in the last paragraph of my statement as incorporated and which is also implicit in the fourth term of reference, that is, `the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to the service'. We are quite happy for that issue to be looked at and quite happy for the inquiry, in doing so, to visit the context in which these issues have been addressed in the past. I do not think there is any basis for Senator Hill or anyone else to get their knickers in a twist about this. The fact that the government has responded so quickly over the last few days is proof of the extent to which we were prepared, were thinking about these issues and were ready to go down paths such as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My consideration of it has been a little more accelerated than I had originally anticipated when the issue blew up in the way that it did. But the underlying issues which the inquiry addresses are ones that certainly pre-date the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners</EMPHASIS> program last week. They are issues which it is very appropriate that an inquiry of this calibre and distinction should address. I hope that the opposition, far from making carping points and quite disgracefully unjustified ones about some aspects of it, will cooperate fully in what is an important exercise in making sure that an important national institution works absolutely properly and effectively in the national interest. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that there are television announcers and news readers who get that sort of income. Of course there are people at the top of the field who get that sort of income, but it should be obvious to us all that under Medicare it is on an individual fee for service basis. To achieve any sort of income under the health system, it is necessary to work hard. I know of one eye specialists who actually sees patients on Sunday mornings. He is an absolute workaholic. He does it then because he thinks it is easier for patients to come and see him then, so he is probably in that category. If that is what he wants to do with his Sunday mornings, that is his choice to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this politics of envy and bashing people who get to the top really has to be stopped in Australia. It is to our national detriment that we try on the tall poppy syndrome&mdash;that it should be part of our ethos. We should be encouraging people to excel. We should be inciting them to do so if we are going to drag this country out of the depths to which it has sunk through this sort of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some doctors actually attract more patients than others. Is that terribly surprising? Is it a surprise that some are better than others? If that is what the honourable senator is concerned about he can go and do a six-year medical course, followed by a nine-year postgraduate training course, and then reach the top of his field if he so wishes, and become one of the 42 who might earn more than $700,000 from the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Senator Richardson should be one such person who complains about this, because I have done a quick survey of what it costs to run Senator Richardson. It is more than $1 million a year. Everybody sitting in this chamber costs the taxpayer more than $700,000 a year. So for Senator Richardson to complain about 42 doctors in Australia who are earning more than $700,000 sounds a bit specious to me. Has the honourable senator looked at the mote in his own eye and considered what it costs the taxpayer to run him?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative is to socialise the lot. It is interesting to see what happened in the USSR and Greece when that was done. The health service degenerated into a poorly-structured poor system with lack of encouragement, and bribery by patients to try to achieve medical care. Alternatively, patients went out of their countries to achieve that care. So that is Senator Richardson's alternative. I think the honourable senator should stop the doctor bashing. I can understand why it is being done, but it is about time Senator Richardson lifted his game and participated in rational debate on the issue. </PARA>

<PARA>I remind the Senate that I asked two questions last week, the first of Senator Gareth Evans and the second of Senator Richardson representing the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. From his answer today, it is clear that Senator Richardson totally misunderstood the point of the question to him. It is therefore worthwhile reminding the Senate of the sequence of questions and the answers received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lie of the first question was this: Australia, in recent years, has increasingly thrown in its lot with Asian countries in the belief that Asia's economic development will be rapid and that somehow, by hooking our future to Asia, we can produce enormous economic and social benefits for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Monday of last week I asked Senator Evans whether he had seen a number of reports in relation to the rapid deterioration of the environment in Asia which would impact very adversely on the ability of Asia to meet the sorts of economic objectives that many people are saying Asia will meet. He said that he had not seen those reports but he asserted in a facile way that economic growth in Asia would lead to the ability of Asian countries to spend more on the environment and so to clean up their environment; that there was nothing inconsistent between the declining environmental standards in Asia and an increase in economic wellbeing and therefore it was desirable for Australians to continue to link our future with that of Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Wednesday, I asked Senator Richardson, representing the minister for the environment, a question relating to stormwater and sewage. That was the point that Senator Richardson picked up today. The point was this: taking the one example of sewage and stormwater, there is abundant evidence that Australia needs to spend not millions of dollars, as Senator Richardson said today, but tens of billions of dollars to clean up problems all round this country, particularly&mdash;but not only&mdash;in relation to capital cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, the whole of the Murray-Darling Basin is very severely polluted. Blue-green algae has broken out again in the lower reaches of the Murray and people down there cannot drink the water and cannot use it for their cattle. Yet Australia, by any standards, is a rich country. The question I asked Senator Evans was: why is it that a rich country cannot find the money to clean up its environment? The point is that Senator Evans was totally wrong in his answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not good enough to say we become more able to spend more on cleaning up the environment as we become richer, because part of the process of becoming richer is the damaging of our environment. Australia as a rich country is one of the worst polluters in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. It has been one of the worst polluters in terms of ozone depleting gases. It is certainly very bad when it comes to its inability to properly deal with toxic wastes through sewage and stormwater, not least in Sydney, which was the example that Senator Richardson picked up today. The original question still stands and remains unanswered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I voice again the very great concern that I have that this country is linking its future more and more strongly with Asia, where country after country is in severe environmental decline. The Chao Phraya River, which goes through Bangkok, is one of the most polluted rivers in the world. The Japanese have deliberately located a great deal of their polluting industry into Bangkok. The air in Bangkok is almost unbreathable, yet we are linking our future with those countries.I raise this warning that I think it is very unwise for us to do so. </PARA>

<PARA>I believe very strongly that Senator Gareth Evans today gave a grossly misleading presentation of the background to the government's betrayal of the Greek-Australian community over the manner of its recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. I would like to fill in a few facts that Senator Evans omitted to mention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one is that this issue really goes back to the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on 3 March 1992, when he laid down three preconditions that the government said needed to be met before Australia would proceed to recognition of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Those three issues were, firstly, that the use of the word `Macedonia' had to be settled in a way that did not cause further tension with Greece; secondly, that Greece's concerns about possible territorial claims or aspirations needed to be fully met; and, thirdly, that the international community's concern about the protection of minorities needed to be fully satisfied. In his statement and as background, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From the point of view of Greece, and the Greek community in Australia, the question of the recognition of the Yugoslavian republic known as Macedonia creates a number of problems which do not exist in relation to other present or former Yugoslavian republics.</PARA>
<PARA>He concluded his statement by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is firmly of the view that the recognition issue should be determined in a way which avoids creating new tensions in a region already undergoing such rapid change.</PARA>
<PARA>All of those points, of course, were ones that were fully supported by the opposition. But then on 15 February this year&mdash;that is, two years later&mdash;Senator Evans made the statement which has caused the present regrettable tensions within some of the communities in Australia. He announced:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia has decided to recognise as an independent state, and to commence discussions on diplomatic relations with, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.</PARA>
<PARA>Amongst other things he said in his statement was that he believed that in the light of the course of events since the Prime Minister's statement of March 1992, the three conditions that he mentioned had now been met. On that same day, in response to Senator Evans's statement, the shadow foreign minister, Mr Peacock, put out a statement which Senator Evans quoted from very selectively today. He omitted to read some things from Mr Peacock's statement. The press release stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Mr Peacock said the Government's approach . . . was nevertheless flawed.</PARA>
<PARA>It also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Government has effectively broken the Prime Minister's undertaking not to proceed to recognition until basic outstanding questions are resolved.</PARA>
<PARA>In it, Mr Peacock said, rightly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister's first condition was that "the use of the word "Macedonia" be settled in a way that does not cause further tension with Greece.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the use of the word "Macedonia" is by no means settled.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Peacock noted that the Greek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, had reiterated on 18 January that Greece would not accept the inclusion of the name Macedonia or any derivative in that of the neighbouring states. Mr Peacock also pointed out that, when speaking in the Greek parliament on 24 January, Prime Minister Papandreou had made it quite clear that Greece's concerns had not yet been fully met&mdash;that is, in relation to the second condition&mdash;and, for this reason, Athens had not yet resumed UN-sponsored talks with Skopje. None of those points was made today by Senator Evans and, therefore, his response was extremely misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that at yesterday's rally in Melbourne several members of parliament from Senator Evans's own party were there. Theo Theophanous was there. Demetri Dollis was there. I give them credit for being there. They are two state members of Greek origin, and they both pointed out that the government was wrong in this decision, not because of the content of the decision but basically because of the fact that the government has now made a recognition in contravention of its earlier decision of two years ago, namely, that certain preconditions had to be met. Those conditions have not been met and therefore the government has betrayed the trust of the Greek-Australian community. That is the issue that is of great concern at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA>The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) fobbed off my request that he substantiate his 2 February comments, as recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, by labelling the thrust of my questions as political. If there is anything political about them, it is the political way in which this government approaches the important issue of the destruction of high conservation value forests to service the woodchip and activated carbon or charcoal export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must admit that I expected a more good humoured response, as is more usual from Senator Collins&mdash;I appreciate that the minister may have been off guard because I gave him no forewarning of my question. There appears to be a longstanding practice or expectation of forewarning. I understand the difficulty of being kept informed across the broad range of issues in the minister's own portfolio, as well those in the portfolio of the minister whom he represents in this place. However, the minister is meant to know because he represents the Minister for Resources (Mr Beddall). This is a key area. There is little point in having ministers representing ministers in the other place if they are not, prior to question time, fully acquainted with major areas of government policy. </PARA>

The reality is that this government has demonstrated a lack of political will to implement the moratorium clause of its national forest policy.

It was only on 3 February this year that she indicated in this place that 500 child-care centres had registered with the accreditation council.

<PARA>The Senate will be aware of the fact that Senator Gareth Evans is between a rock and a hard place on this matter. Of course, this may explain why his uncharacteristic rudeness and unusual personal abuse of me should have taken place. The fact is, of course, that if Senator Evans admits that there is still a debt of $4.45 million owing by the company of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Mr John Brown's company, he then admits that he has been misleading this chamber by saying that the real debt is $2.76 million remaining in the audited accounts. </PARA>

Was it magically hidden in the accounts in a book transfer, in which case why are the Prime Minister's companies&mdash;and why is Senator Evans&mdash;trying to pretend that a debt of $4.45 million is in fact only a debt of $2.76 million; a debt from the Prime Minister's half-owned company to Mr Brown, a former colleague, who is a very effective lobbyist and who is, of course, on some governmental bodies?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans continues to assert that it is only $2.76 million, then he has to assure this chamber that $1.7 million has not in fact been paid since the Prime Minister acquired his half interest. He has to assure this chamber that it has not been paid or has not been forgiven by Mr Brown since the Prime Minister became a half owner of this company while the Treasurer in May 1991. If he does not, if he cannot assure us of that, he clearly faces this magnificent conflict:  he says there is no leverage because it does not have to be paid. If it has been paid&mdash;if that is the explanation and reason for the reduction from $4.45 million, which the accounts first revealed as at 30 June 1991, well after the Prime Minister acquired his interest&mdash;then Senator Evans's special submission that this loan has no leverage because it does not have to be paid until the company has earned a profit, and at the discretion of the directors, is self-evident bunkum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly Senator Evans is in a very difficult situation. Does he admit that Mr Brown's company is owed $4.45 million&mdash;which any sensible reading of the accounts clearly indicates&mdash;or does he stick to the fiction that all that is owed is the $2.76 million? By the way, whatever the amount is there is still a potential for conflict of interest because it is still a debt, whether it is subordinated or not. It still has to be paid one way or another if the company earns a profit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advise Senator Evans to go away and have a look at the accounts. He said that he did not have the accounts with him. I do, and these accounts clearly show, for Senator Evans's information, that the amount outstanding to Mr Brown and his company has been written down. There has been an allocation made against it in the current accounts. A total of more than $1 million has been written off this debt, presumably, I would suggest, by being transferred to, and submerged in, the huge volume of inter-company debt&mdash;$19 million. This debt has been transferred out of the clear debt to John Brown and hidden in this debt to related bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me extraordinary that any government, any person or any company should go to these extremes to hide the level of indebtedness of the Prime Minister's company to a government lobbyist, Mr John Brown. Why on earth does Senator Evans not come clean? Why does he not admit what the facts are?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Housing Assistance Amendment Bill 1993 amends subsection 7(3A) and section 15 of the Housing Assistance Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under this act the States are provided with financial assistance by the Commonwealth to deliver housing assistance for rental housing and home purchase in accordance with the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement. That Agreement, commonly referred to as the CSHA, is Schedule 1 to the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In amending subsection 7(3A) of this act, the bill sets out revised appropriations made under the act for the years 1993 to 1996. This will give effect to a number of Government decisions announced in the 1993-94 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revisions arise from a rephasing of $25 million originally brought forward to 1993-94 from out-years for the purposes of employment generation and of $10 million for the Community Housing Program which was originally to be available for payment in 1993-94. In addition, there has been a small one-off adjustment to new 1993-94 funds for the Crisis Accommodation Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ensuring that Australians have access to affordable and appropriate housing remains a key priority for the Federal Government in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to appropriations proposed in this bill is consistent with the Government's housing priorities. It continues the Government's commitment to providing long term financial assistance for the provision of public housing, funding for the provision of the new Community Housing Program (CHP), and continuing support for the Crisis Accommodation Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the $1042.39 million to be appropriated in 1993-94 under the terms of the bill, the 1989 act also allows for unpaid Commonwealth funds to be carried forward from 1992-93. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human  Services has determined that a total of $82.3 million will be carried forward under this provision, resulting in total Commonwealth funds available under the CSHA in 1993-94 of $1125 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of its 1992-1993 Budget initiatives, the Government announced that $100 million of CSHA funds earmarked for expenditure in later years would be available for expenditure on employment generation projects in 1992-93 and 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These funds were to be made available for allocation to States which were able to demonstrate an ability to accelerate housing activity, particularly in areas of high unemployment. In 1992-93, $75 million in funds brought forward from later years was allocated to the States on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There can be no doubt that bringing forward these funds in 1992-93 was an important and successful initiative. It provided a significant boost to expenditure on construction and capital upgrading projects which were able to be implemented quickly. In addition, the projects funded in various States created additional employment while furthering the Government's strategic housing objectives in terms of social justice and urban consolidation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the basis of this success, the Government had no hesitation in approving the carry-over from 1992-93 of unpaid Commonwealth funds, totalling $22.3 million, to be available for payment to relevant States for employment generation purposes in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, circumstances have changed since the decision to bring forward a further $25 million in Commonwealth funds to 1993-94 was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992-93 housing sector activity was 15 per cent higher than it was in 1991-92. In addition, dwelling commencements in 1993-94 are expected to total about 168,000.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, housing activity is presently predicted to be lower in 1994-95 than in 1991-92. The underlying level of demand has been forecast by the Indicative Planning Council as averaging 117,000 over the next five years. This is the product of a fall in demand due to a drop in immigration to Australia and the satisfaction of pent-up demand over the last year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carry-over of $82.3 million from 1992-93 into 1993-94 is also underpinning substantial capital and upgrading projects, which are currently planned or under way. It is estimated that this carry-over is supporting around 900 extra jobs in the construction industry. This employment boost is having flow-on effects to other economic sectors as well.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the need to allocate $25 million of funds, previously brought forward for expenditure in 1993-94, is not as pressing as it was when the decision was made more than a year ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this reason, the Government has decided to rephase that $25 million so that an additional $12.5 million in CSHA funding will be available in untied funds in both 1994-95 and 1995-96. The $25 million intended for expenditure in 1993-94 is thus being fully restored over the following two years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Community Housing Program has been designed to achieve an expansion of this sector and the Government has secured the enthusiastic support of non-government agencies to meet this challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, Federal Government funding for the CHP over the next three years has been revised to reflect likely expenditure patterns. Ten million dollars, originally earmarked for expenditure on the CHP in 1993-94, has been rephased so that an additional $5 million will be available for expenditure on this program in both 1994-95 and 1995-96. Funding of $60.8 million (including $18.8 million in unpaid Commonwealth funds carried forward from 1992-93) will be available for payment under the CHP in 1993-94, with $62 million in new funds allocated in 1994-95 and $69 million in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also committed to the continuing provision of assistance to people in housing crisis.  Total Commonwealth funds available for expenditure on the Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) in 1993-94 amount to $73.6 million, comprising $36.2 million in new funds, $7.1 million in unpaid Commonwealth funds carried over from 1992-93, and an additional $30.3 million in  unspent CAP funds already held by the States. The total amount available in 1993-94 is some $20 million more than was spent in 1992-93.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Compared with this level of funds, the proposed cut to CAP funds of $3.5 million is modest&mdash;a reduction of less than 5 per cent of total funds for 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to make this adjustment to CAP funding in 1993-94 was taken in the light of a pattern of significant under expenditure in the program. At 30 June 1993, over $37 million in previous years' allocations remained unspent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Program under expenditure has been partly attributable to an inability to plan projects on the basis of funds becoming available in subsequent years. This constraint has been removed, with States now able to anticipate Commonwealth funding up to 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has also included CAP in the new cash management arrangements for the CSHA which were introduced in 1992-93. Under these arrangements, Commonwealth funds will only be advanced to States as required&mdash;payments are made no more than a month in advance of estimated expenditure. Together with the ability to better plan outlays as a result of the forward commitment capability, this is expected to provide a significant incentive to improve program performance and reduce unspent funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the capital funding arm of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP), CAP featured in the recent national evaluation of SAAP. The evaluation concluded that SAAP has fulfilled an essential role in funding the crisis and transitional accommodation needed by homeless people (113 dwellings with 480 beds were approved in 1992-93).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there is some criticism of the relative inflexibility with which funds have been applied:  there has been an over emphasis on the design and construction of dwellings rather than purchase, and insufficient attention to leasing options. These matters will be addressed in the development of strategic directions for SAAP commissioned by Social Welfare Ministers, and in the CAP review commissioned by Housing Ministers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In amending section 15 of the act by adding a new subsection 15(2A), the amendment to the bill sets out provision for the Commonwealth Minister to authorise the full level of untied grants to a particular State in 1994-95 even if the Minister cannot ensure that the State can meet the balance of its matching obligation from the value of home loans provided through its home purchase assistance programs in accordance with paragraph 13(2)(b) of the CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The addition of a new section 15A sets out provision for the Commonwealth Minister effectively to waive or reduce a State or Territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance, provided by the Commonwealth to a State for housing assistance from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs&mdash;this provision will apply only for 1993-94 and 1994-95.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments will not, however, relieve an affected State of its grant matching obligations under the Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commonwealth untied assistance provided under the CSHA to the States and Territories is used for a number of purposes, predominantly for building or purchase of public rental housing stock.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSHA requires States to match this untied assistance on a dollar-for-dollar basis, with at least half of the matching provided through State grants and the balance through the value of loans made under home purchase assistance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, difficulties have recently arisen as a result of lower demand for home purchase assistance products and the relatively attractive terms of commercial products in the current economic climate. The affected States have also indicated that they are not able to provide additional grant funding to meet the 1993-94 matching obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of 1993-94, where it has become evident that some States will not undertake sufficient lending under their home purchase assistance programs to meet their obligations under the Agreement, the CSHA provides for the Commonwealth to recover financial assistance already provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of 1994-95, where some States have indicated that they are unlikely to be able to meet their matching requirements, the Housing Assistance Act requires that the Minister not provide funds which will not be matched. This effectively means that the Commonwealth must reduce untied grants for public housing provision to a level that will be matched.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that either to recover financial assistance already provided or to reduce funding to be provided would be undesirable. It would reduce funds for public housing and, in light of the current demand for such housing, would disadvantage those most in need of assistance. Also, it would be undesirable to pursue such action where States are genuinely unable to meet such requirements because of changed market conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To force States to increase lending at this time solely to meet their matching requirements may result in loans being made to more and more marginal clients. This could impact adversely on the viability of the overall home lending program in the longer term as well as creating problems for clients should their circumstances change.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any decision to waive or reduce the home purchase assistance matching requirement will only be taken after careful consideration of the circumstances leading to the need for such a course of action and will be determined on a case-by-case basis. Issues taken into account when making this decision will include the economic environment in the relevant grant year, the availability of alternative home lending finance products to low to moderate income earners, a State's lending effort and commitment in previous years and the nature of the programs being offered by an affected State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not possible at this time to detail specifically the extent of any waiver or reduction of the home purchase assistance matching requirement. The financial information required for 1993-94 will not be available until the end of the financial year, and in the case of 1994-95 States are not required, under the Agreement, to provide details of their matching proposals until 31 March this year, and even this will be based on estimated levels of lending only. However, in 1993-94 it would appear that New South Wales will have a shortfall of the order of $130 million (their total obligation); Victoria's is difficult to estimate as it will depend on the take-up rate of its new shared home ownership program, which is likely to be introduced progressively from April; and Tasmania's shortfall is estimated at this time to be around $2 million. The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services will be pursuing the issue of 1994-95 matching with the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any determination will only be made after consultation with the relevant State Minister, and after the Federal Minister for Housing, Local Government and Human Services is satisfied that this course of action is the most appropriate. In the case of 1994-95 any action will only be taken after consideration by the Government. To ensure ongoing Parliamentary oversight these determinations will be tabled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This remedy to current difficulties will not be open-ended. It is intended only as a short term response to ensure that those in need of public housing are not disadvantaged. Policy in the home purchase assistance area is being considered in consultation with the States and Territories, and in the context of the Government's consideration of the Industry Commission report on public housing and other housing policy issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the bill provides for variations in expenditure made available for various programs funded under the CSHA for the years 1993 to 1996 and its provisions reflect the level of housing activity which is expected to be achieved during this period. The bill also provides for the Minister to waive or reduce a State or Territory's obligation to match the balance of untied assistance from the value of home loans provided through home purchase assistance programs for 1993-94 and 1994-95 only.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is consistent with improved cash management arrangements for the CSHA which have been negotiated successfully with the States by the Commonwealth Government. These arrangements provide for improved accountability for Commonwealth funds which are provided to the States under the CSHA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, noting that the Government is close to finalising a Nuclear Science and Technology Co-operation Agreement with Indonesia which will foreshadow the future sale of uranium to Indonesia; expressing concern that the Government, through the co-operation agreement, has given its endorsement to Indonesia's nuclear energy program; condemning the Government for the secrecy surrounding Australia's bilateral nuclear agreements; and noting that Indonesia plans to build nuclear reactors in a region of high seismic activity and that the degree of that activity exceeds the maximum recommended by its own nuclear agency as acceptable, the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The details and arrangements which are covered under any nuclear co-operation agreement, including the draft Indonesian agreement, in particular, the degree to which such arrangements are considered to be in the `national interest' and whether or not they obligate Australia to operate a nuclear reactor.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion concerns the plan by Indonesia to build 12 600-megawatt nuclear power stations on Java and seeks to refer this matter to the Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. Despite the fact that this motion has been on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> for some time, I have to tell the Senate and those listening outside that I have failed to convince either the government or the opposition that this is an appropriate technical matter to be dealt with by that committee. I expect that this motion will be voted down without any debate, but I wish to make a few remarks to indicate the importance the Australian Democrats attach to this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have felt for quite a long time that nuclear power is inherently dangerous&mdash;that it is a technology fraught with a number of very particular and very idiosyncratic dangers which spread far beyond the borders of the country which may choose to use nuclear power. Indeed, it was back in the late 1960s or early 1970s that Alvin Weinberg, a nuclear scientist in the US and a strong nuclear advocate, spoke of the need to establish what he called a nuclear priesthood&mdash;a priestly class of people whose job in perpetuity, for generation after generation, would be the care of nuclear power. As the older members of this chamber will recall, he was the one who invented the term `Faustian bargain', the bargain by which, in return for nuclear power and nuclear electricity, we would have to set up this nuclear priesthood&mdash;these people who would, by profession and for the whole of their lives, look to the security of nuclear power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some nations have entered into that Faustian bargain and some nations, such as Russia, with its Chernobyl reactor, have come unstuck and have had to pay an awful price for having entered into that bargain. Another example is India, and I mention it for a particular reason. India is a developing nation, rather like Indonesia, where the technology has not been carefully looked after. Large parts of India around nuclear installations have become extensively polluted with radioactive contamination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are risks directly associated with the technology&mdash;the inability to control the spread of radioactive material either from the mining of uranium, its enrichment, the handling of the fuels, from the nuclear power stations themselves, from the very processing facilities, the very long-term storage which is necessary, and also from the decommissioning of nuclear power stations. But there is also a military connection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With Indonesia, that is a very interesting connection. Quite recently, no less an organisation than the United States Pentagon drew attention to the very close links between civil nuclear programs and the acquisition of nuclear materials and technology which would allow nations clandestinely, despite non-proliferation treaties and bilateral treaties, to acquire the facilities to make nuclear weapons. Honourable senators may have forgotten the fact that some years ago, when Indonesia first went down this nuclear road, it sought to buy Candu reactors&mdash;Canadian deuterium uranium reactors&mdash;which use heavy water as a moderator and unenriched uranium. They have the advantage of making twice as much plutonium as the American light water reactors and can be unloaded while on-line. In other words, the fuel can be progressively taken out without shutting down the reactor, while the unloading escapes detection by international agents from the International Atomic Energy Agency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would also be aware that North Korea at this very time is failing to allow the international inspection which would allow us to be certain that it is not using its civil nuclear reactors as a means of acquiring nuclear weapons and possibly threatening that part of the world. Honourable senators will probably also recall the problems we had with Iraq&mdash;the building of the French reactor in Baghdad&mdash;and the way in which the Israelis went in some years ago with a pre-emptive strike, recognising the enormous risks to Israel presented by the Iraqis acquiring nuclear weapons through the facility of a civil nuclear reactor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may not be as aware that, before the overthrow of the Shah of Iran, Germany was about to build a number of nuclear reactors in Iran and also provide the reprocessing facilities which would have given Iran access to plutonium and materials to make nuclear weapons. Of course, the overthrow of the Shah and the general turmoil in that part of the world led to the abandonment of that program and those nuclear reactors were not built. But one could well imagine the horrific circumstance that might have obtained in the Middle East had Iran and Iraq both had access to nuclear weapons&mdash;and that is really saying something, given the fires in the oil wells and so on. I have no doubt that they would have used them and that those weapons would have been acquired through legitimate civil nuclear programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Returning to the first concern&mdash;the dangers from the reactors themselves&mdash;as I said, Indonesia plans to build 12 600-megawatt reactors on Java, in the middle of one of the most seismically active areas in the world. Indeed, on the weekend I read in a copy of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science</EMPHASIS> that some 70,000 years ago probably one of the world's worst volcanic eruptions occurred quite close by on Sumatra which resulted in a mini ice age, the extinction of many species, a spreading of the ice sheet across much of North America and Europe. For the humans of that time it must have been incredibly distressing with the great loss of life. Just in the last century and a half, one has seen a number of major earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in the Indonesian archipelago, extending all the way from Sumatra through to Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Indonesian nuclear authorities themselves have said they should not build nuclear power stations in areas where the expectation of an earthquake would exceed 6.7 on the Richter scale, and yet Java is expected to have earthquakes of eight on the Richter scale. I remind senators that that scale is a logarithmic scale and when we go from Richter seven to Richter eight there is a ten-fold increase in the amount of energy and the damage which can result from those earthquakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe very considerable risks are associated with the plans by Indonesia to build these nuclear power stations in that region. Given the prevailing winds, should the nuclear power stations rupture and release the sort of radioactivity that occurred from the Chernobyl reactor&mdash;although they are not going to be of that type; their rupture would occur through an earthquake, not because of some fault in the reactor&mdash;the likelihood of radioactive contamination across the northern parts of Australia and also Papua New Guinea is very high indeed, with enormous risks to human life and the environment generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons Indonesia is choosing to go down this road are not clear at all. There is no doubt that nuclear power stations are expensive, that nuclear power will not provide for the needs of most of Indonesia's people, given the fact that Indonesia is scattered over some 2,000 islands. Moreover, it has available other sources of energy which it could use which would be, in fact, cheaper. Indonesia, as the parliamentary committee found, has some 2.2 per cent of the world's known gas reserves, and on a per capita basis this is approximately the average allocation. Eighty five per cent of that is being exported to Japan. Those who would argue using gas would add to greenhouse emissions are ignoring the fact that gas is being exploited now, anyway, and causing greenhouse gas emissions. It would simply be a matter of using that for Indonesia's indigenous supply of electricity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a very considerable availability of geothermal energy, some 16 gigowatts. Sixteen thousand megawatts of power could be derived from geothermal sources. Some 75 gigowatts&mdash;10 times the amount which could be derived from nuclear sources&mdash;could be derived from hydro-electric installations. There is considerable concern that such large installations would cause severe disruption in many areas and would be resisted by many people. Small hydro-electric schemes are precisely the sorts of things likely to give electricity to people at the village level and substantially improve their life, whereas large central nuclear power stations on Java are not likely to do so. There is also considerable possibility for solar hot water for cooking purposes which could again be used at the village level and in which Australia could play a very significant part in helping the Indonesian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, it is with great regret that I have to report all these technical questions in relation to seismicity in Java and to the risks associated with nuclear damage from these proposed 12 nuclear power stations, the risks to northern Australia and our neighbours in Papua New Guinea, the technical issues of the links between civil and military nuclear programs, so evident in other countries, will not be taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It is also a great pity with respect to Australia's involvement that it seems as though we are being led down the road towards closer association and cooperation with this Indonesian program without either the Australian people or the parliament being told exactly what it is we are entering into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over some years I have raised with the foreign minister, Senator Evans, the question of what sorts of arrangements have been entered into with Indonesia. At each stage I have been put off with quite bland assertions that very little has been agreed to. Yet, when I ask a question approximately a year later, I find a great deal has been negotiated and the parliament has not been told. It would be very appropriate for us to have this inquiry, but I repeat that neither the government nor the opposition is prepared to agree to this. Despite having put this motion off for some time in the hope that the government and opposition might have changed their minds, it is with great regret, nonetheless, that they are not prepared to look at this issue. I fully expect that the motion will be voted down. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention some of the areas that have been the subject of considerable public debate and explain briefly the coalition's position and why we in fact have decided to support the amendments. Some of the most important changes are to the archives and freedom of information acts dealing with the question of cabinet notebooks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been the subject of considerable public debate for some time as to whether or not it is appropriate for cabinet notebooks to be made public, and in what circumstances they should be made public; in other words, whether publication would prejudice confidentiality of cabinet conduct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was of such concern to the government a few years ago that there was discussion between the parties about what the attitude would be to the government introducing further restrictive legislation. The real concern was the interpretation of the provisions under the Freedom of Information Act. There was some doubt as to how those provisions might be interpreted. It was thought by some that there would be a somewhat liberal interpretation which would oblige a previously unprecedented disclosure of this area of confidential cabinet records. The case of the Commonwealth and the Northern Land Council reported in 1993 put to rest much of the concern previously expressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its decision of April of that year, the High Court held that documents recording the deliberations of cabinet fall within a class in respect of which strong considerations of public policy mitigate against disclosure. The court held that only in quite exceptional circumstances, where there was a significant likelihood that the public interest in due administration of justice outweighed the public interest in confidentiality of cabinet documents, would their production be ordered in court. We support that decision. It seems to us that this is a matter best left to the courts. We are comforted by the fact that, in the future, courts following that precedent will properly understand the importance of the principle of confidentiality and would need to find that a circumstance exists where due administration of justice outweighs public interest in confidentiality before an order for disclosure is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, there is obviously an important function in releasing documents for historical purposes. The government has decided in this instance to amend the Archives Act 1993 so that cabinet notebooks would be accessible after a period of 50 years rather than the more standard period of 30 years. That seems to us to be sensible. Having also made that change by this legislation, the Freedom of Information Act is then amended to make clear that cabinet documents are excluded from the operation of the act. With this package, the large administrative costs of receiving and processing an application under the Freedom of Information Act will not be incurred; the court will make the determination as to whether the circumstances justify release; and the documents will be open to public scrutiny for historical purposes after a period of 50 years. On balance, that is a reasonable compromise and we are prepared to support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the same reason that cabinet notebooks should be kept as a record of cabinet deliberations&mdash;to be referred to by future cabinets when wanting to clarify issues in relation to decision-making processes of cabinet&mdash;it is important to stress that other documents should also be kept. It was most disturbing to the coalition to note reports that out-going ministers of the Victorian state Labor government had shredded state cabinet documents. We trust that would not occur at a federal level under the administration of this government. We would appreciate assurances as to the safekeeping by the Commonwealth government of all its formal cabinet records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Science and Technology Council Act 1978 is amended. This seems to be principally an administrative change and I do not dwell on it. However, there are important amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 that I want to mention. The first amendment is to clarify the fact that the Merit Protection and Review Agency has jurisdiction over Commonwealth employees employed by a statutory authority under an industrial award. I am advised that this was always understood to be the intention, but that doubt arose. This amendment is designed to overcome that uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation would apply retrospectively, and we always look at anything with a retrospective consequence with great care. We have been convinced that the amendment has the effect of preserving the status of matters dealt with by the agency over the last 10 years and therefore should be allowed. The individual awards would have to allow for reference to the Merit Protection and Review Agency before this provision would apply. If they do, we have no problems in that regard and support the amendment which, we were told, is simply to implement what was always understood to be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment complements a proposed amendment to the Ombudsman Act 1976 to allow for transfer of complaints between the two agencies, depending on which agency could more appropriately deal with the complaint. That would appear to be a sensible rationalisation of functions, and it also has our support. The act has a number of changes made to it by virtue of this bill. They arise out of consideration of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Review of the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman</EMPHASIS>, released in December 1991. The government responded in December 1992, and we finally have this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One amendment facilitates the transfer of complaints between the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the ombudsman. This arose from the recommendation of the Senate committee that the ombudsman should have jurisdiction to deal with complaints from persons and organisations claiming to have been misrepresented on ABC programs. In the event of a jurisdictional dispute continuing, the government would consider other legislative options. As I understand it, the advice of the committee was rejected in that regard. The government considered that the ABA provides an adequate forum for persons claiming to have been misrepresented on ABC and SBS programs. The ombudsman, however, retains jurisdiction over action relating to matters of administration, including those arising in the preparation and broadcast of programs. If I have understood the measure correctly, it is reasonable, and we support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate committee also recommended that the jurisdiction of the Merit Protection and Review Agency to investigate employment related grievances be transferred to the ombudsman. The government decided not to implement this recommendation because removal of such an important function from the MPRA could jeopardise its status as a major element in Public Service management and industrial relations. Again, the government decided instead to facilitate the transfer of complaints between the two. We think that that is a reasonable position and should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the Senate committee recommended that the government consider assigning the role of the telecommunications industry ombudsman to the Commonwealth ombudsman and that future decisions to establish specialist ombudsmen institutions be made having regard to whether the Commonwealth ombudsman could perform the particular function. The government decided that the telecommunications industry ombudsman scheme should reflect the commercial nature of the industry and cater for the commercial manner in which the participants wish to deal with customer complaints and that therefore it was not appropriate to extend the Commonwealth ombudsman's jurisdiction to the private sector participants in the industry. We are prepared to support that approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wanted to mention some of the changes to the Public Service Act 1922 and the Superannuation Act 1976 that this bill would effect. Firstly, the bill amends the Public Service Act to allow for departments to apply an order of merit principle when filling positions which were filled on the advice of a joint selection committee and become vacant within six months of the original appointment. Currently, if the original position becomes vacant or an identical position in the same department becomes vacant, the department would have to go through the normal recruitment procedure to fill the position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursuant to these amendments, the next applicant in order of merit can be offered the position if it becomes vacant within six months of the original position being offered. That seems to be a sensible saving of resources and we support it. Secondly, the bill contains amendments relating to disciplinary measures to bring the range of penalties currently available for unattached officers into line with those available for attached officers. Whilst I will not detail them, we think that that is sensible also and should be supported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that the principal amendments in relation to the Public Service are those which relate to fixed term appointments for secretaries of departments. The government is proposing to allow all persons appointed to the position of departmental secretary the option of accepting a fixed term contract with higher remuneration in exchange for their long-term tenure in the Public Service. Existing departmental secretaries and appointments from inside the Public Service to the position will be given the option of a fixed term contract of up to five years and an increase in salary of 20 per cent on the condition that they resign from the Australian Public Service, effectively forgoing their residual rights to tenure in the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The option will be extended to both existing departmental secretaries and future appointments from inside and outside the Public Service. The option will also be available to six statutory officers: the Auditor-General; the Public Service Commissioner; the Commissioner of Taxation; the Australian Statistician; the head of ATSIC; and the Comptroller-General of Customs. However, in relation to these statutory appointments no legislative change is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Remuneration Tribunal has indicated in principle agreement to the additional remuneration of 20 per cent above the current salary of departmental secretaries. Other terms and conditions of appointment will not be affected and there is no limitation on the number of successive contracts that might be entered into if both parties agree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, the act allows only for people appointed to the position of departmental secretary from outside the Public Service to be employed on a fixed term contract. Of course, this means that the appointment does not give them tenure in the Public Service beyond the terms of the contract. The act stipulates that the contract can be no longer than five years and cannot be extended to someone beyond the age of 65. In effect, this change gives the option of buying out tenure with terms and conditions agreed between the parties. We think that it is a sensible reform that will give greater flexibility at the top of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would be aware some of the states are now negotiating packages for very senior officers in the Public Service at much higher rates of remuneration. It is necessary for the Commonwealth to be competitive. It is also necessary for the Commonwealth to have the flexibility to attract the best, whether from within or without the Public Service. We therefore accept this change. Although some might see it as some sort of hidden pay rise, we recognise that something is being given up to get it and that is what enterprise bargaining is supposed to be all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other changes to the Royal Commissions Act and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation Act but I do not need to refer to them specifically now. In summary, we support the legislation. We do, however, raise that concern that came out of the public reports, that the Victorian state Labor government may have shredded state cabinet documents. We look forward to some reassurance from the minister at the table, Senator Sherry, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, or from the representative of the minister that that would not occur at this level of government. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1111" SPEAKER="Kernot Sen C." NAMEID="XW4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="QLD">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will not be opposing the Prime Minister and Cabinet (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill but we have three concerns that we want to place on the record. The first relates to public access to cabinet notebooks. As Senator Hill said, under this bill cabinet notebooks will no longer be excluded from the provisions of the Archives Act. The public will now have access to those notebooks for the first time. However, the bill protects those notebooks for a 50-year period, which is 20 years longer than for other confidential or protected documents under FOI legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we accept the argument that, because of their particularly sensitive nature, cabinet notebooks probably warrant a greater degree of protection than that accorded other cabinet documents, we have a few reservations about whether an extra 20 years is required. We are also mindful of the fact that any exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act only serve to undermine the object of the act, which is `to extend as far as possible the right of the Australian community to access to information in the possession of the government of the Commonwealth'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that cabinet and executive council documents require some additional protection and that, as the High Court decided last year, there are strong public policy considerations which weigh against the production of cabinet notebooks. However, balanced against that is the need to be sending a very strong message to the Australian community that our public institutions are not afraid of and in fact welcome close public scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when the public is demanding, and rightly so, much greater accountability from government and a much higher standard of openness from its elected representatives, it is disappointing to find governments failing to respond to these concerns with the sort of integrity and honesty that the public has a right to expect from them. We have heard the word `accountability' bandied around a lot in this place and in the media recently. I would not wish to see that word become devalued by over-use but the public has a right to expect its elected representatives to be accountable for their actions. As I said, although I would have preferred to see cabinet notebooks become available after 30 years rather than 50, I accept that the provisions of this bill represent a step forward in the cause of public accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area I want to note is the change to the Commonwealth Ombudsman's powers. As we have heard, the bill expands the ombudsman's investigatory powers to include the administrative actions of the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal registries, the Commonwealth parliamentary departments and Commonwealth controlled companies; a discretion to decline to investigate the commercial activities of Commonwealth agencies; and the capacity to transfer complaints to the Australian Broadcasting Authority, the Merit Protection and Review Agency or industry ombudsman. These changes came out of the review of the Office of the Ombudsman carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is pleasing to see a government respond to the changes recommended by a Senate committee. We welcome these changes, but we urge the minister to ensure that the Commonwealth Ombudsman actually has the financial resources to meet these additional obligations. We all know how the best efforts can be stymied through a lack of resources. The Auditor-General could well be a case in point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area involves changes to the Public Service Act and the Superannuation Act. The bill includes amendments which will enable the government to give effect to its decision to allow Australian Public Service departmental secretaries and a number of equal level statutory office holders to relinquish their continuing tenure in the Public Service in return for a reasonable loading on their salaries. That loading will be set by the Remuneration Tribunal. I understand that the government has recommended to the tribunal that that loading be set at 20 per cent. Senator Hill said that the Remuneration Tribunal had accepted that. Perhaps the parliamentary secretary could comment on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This seems to be a somewhat illusory trade-off because in many ways, I think it is true, departmental secretaries do not have a great deal of security. I am sure that many secretaries will not be overly concerned about giving up their pretty precarious tenure in exchange for a healthy pay rise. The Democrats will not be opposing these measures, but we do want to place on the parliamentary record our concern about the trend towards the increasing politicisation of the most senior levels of the Public Service. I put the government on notice that we will be watching the development of this trade-off measure very closely to ensure that it does not exacerbate or accelerate that trend. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to respond to one matter raised by Senator Hill and a couple of matters raised by Senator Kernot. Senator Hill raised the matter of the alleged destruction of cabinet documents on the cessation of office by ministers in the previous Labor government in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cabinet documents&mdash;at least at the federal level&mdash;are kept in accordance with the rules and procedures under the Archives Act, and referred to in the cabinet handbook. Under the Archives Act cabinet documents are the property of the Commonwealth and not individual ministers. So ministers are requested to either return copies of cabinet documents to the Cabinet Office&mdash;and they are obviously kept within the provisions of the Archives Act&mdash;or to destroy them on leaving office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about `destroying', it is only in the sense that we do not need to keep 50 copies of the same document. The original documents have already been kept. There is no question of cabinet records being destroyed by this government in the sense referred to by Senator Hill, should we leave office. Copies of cabinet documents are available under the Archives Act after the 30 years that are provided, and there are no relevant exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three issues were touched on by Senator Kernot. The first was the issue of the notebooks, and whether or not the 20-year differential was too great a degree of protection vis-a-vis cabinet documents, which have 30 years protection.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter that Senator Kernot raised was the financial resources that are given to the Office of the Ombudsman.

The amount was slightly less than $1 million&mdash;I cannot give the exact figure. So that was in direct response to the matters raised in that Senate report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that Senator Kernot touched on was the additional payment of 20 per cent in respect of secretaries who voluntarily&mdash;I think that should be stressed; it is in the second reading speech and the notes and advisory documents&mdash;relinquish their permanency. That has been advised by the Remuneration Tribunal. It is the organisation that is best placed to make these decisions.

<PARA>The first amendment, which is to omit proposed section 926 and substitute another section, is designed to overcome what I believe is a problem with this legislation. It is important for the committee to understand the import of these amendments I have just moved, to ensure that no family currently receiving the DSR through the taxation system is worse off under this particular measure. In other words, it is really to keep the government honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) announced that there would be a home child-care allowance. He said that this would apply to all the families currently receiving the DSR. That was the message received by the community at large prior to the last election. This legislation attempts to take away the DSR from families with at least one child and sometimes more children and which were previously receiving the maximum DSR. Now some of those families are going to have that taken away from them completely or the amount will be reduced, for some unknown reason, to the equivalent of the DSR for a family with no children. Families with children will now be in the situation where their DSR equivalent will be at the rate of a family with no children. There is no rhyme or reason in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the interpretation of ordinary income under this proposal will take money away from people by stealth. The definition of ordinary income for the purposes of the dependent spouse rebate income test is different from the one proposed here. The old concept in the tax law of separate net income meant that income, according to ordinary concepts, did not include occasional windfalls or gifts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this legislation, the new social security definition for ordinary income includes a wider range of potential receipts. People who previously would have qualified for the DSR will now be denied part or all of it as it is being cashed up into the home child-care and partner allowance. Is that fair? I do not believe it is fair. If the government were doing this, it really should have been quite open with people and told them that prior to the election, but it did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No families that I know of believed that they would lose out as a result of the government's change in definition. Indeed, the social security definition can include deemed income, which is not income at all. My amendment is designed to restore the status quo to avoid detriment to any family. I believe that that was the Prime Minister's intention prior to the last election. I have not heard anything since to alter that belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is fairly clear. The home child-care allowance will not be available where a child is a student over 16 or outside Australia. The existing dependent spouse rebate is available in all these cases. Again, the principle of this measure is simply to maintain the status quo for families, not to use this as a device to take away from families money which they are already getting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give honourable senators an example. If a family has a student child on Austudy, it gets the DSR of $14.25. Under this proposal, the cashed up amount is the equivalent of the DSR for a childless couple. Why should those people lose $237 by being cut out from the HCCA and put onto the spouse rebate for a childless couple? I ask the committee: does a child cost $237 less once the child becomes a student? What is the difference before and after? I will give another example. At the moment couples with student children up to the age of 25 years get a DSR of $14.25. Under this bill, families will be denied HCCA once the last child is over 16 and leaves school or turns 18. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I appeal to the Labor members to understand this. Some years ago the government abolished the dole for 16-year-olds on the basis that their parents, not the taxpayer, should look after them. But now, under this measure, it says that the child does not exist at all for the purposes of the cashed up DSR, which will be the new home child-care allowance. If parents kick a child out because they are too broke to pay the bills, the government will fork out the young homeless child allowance. Why not recognise in this measure the fact that that child is dependent upon the family? The government has made him or her dependent on the family by cutting out the dole at 16. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to give honourable senators another example of a situation where families will be worse off under this measure than they were under the DSR, and it applies to Australians who are posted overseas for a period while the remaining legal residents are paying Australian taxes. Persons who come to mind are diplomats, soldiers and missionaries; this was discussed by most honourable senators contributing to this debate in the second reading stage. At the moment families in this category get the higher level of DSR of $14.25 where there are children. They too will be ripped off by $237. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is why? Why can a family not go overseas for more than 13 weeks?  Many families have to go. Why can a family not leave a child overseas for a few months with a relative to complete the year's schooling whilst the rest of the family completes a posting and returns to Australia? That regularly happens in the diplomatic service. I believe that these questions are legitimate and deserve responses. What legitimate reason can there be for stripping families in these sorts of situations of $237?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I finally make the point to the committee that I am not asking for anything more for families than they already get. I am saying we should not disadvantage them. In this International Year of the Family we should not take away from families what they are already entitled to. That is what the government is doing with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendments are in the form of a request to the House of Representatives. I do not want anyone here to run away with the idea that I am suggesting that my amendments will mean an additional burden on the taxpayer or the government purse. I am trying to make sure that people will be able to maintain what they are entitled to now&mdash;with, of course, the generous amount of $2.60 per week, which is the net increase being proposed by the government. In all fairness, my amendments should be supported and deserve support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The amendments that Senator Harradine has circulated are, in fact, in the spirit of the amendment calling on the government to address this issue that I moved in my speech during the second reading debate. As Senator Harradine pointed out, Mr Keating said at the last election that families would be given a home child-care allowance. There was no indication that certain families would be excluded&mdash;families who were eligible for the dependent spouse rebate but who, because of differences between the Social Security Act and the taxation act, would be excluded. We called on the government to make those amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees claimed that I said I did not have time to make amendments. As I said in my personal explanation, that was not the case; I did not say that at all. Senator Lees said that because the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill had to be passed that day&mdash;I do not understand why that had to be the case&mdash;the Australian Democrats would not support my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My amendment called on the government to ensure that people with children who are currently eligible for the dependent spouse rebate are not prevented from transferring to the home child-care allowance. It also called on the government to ensure that there should not be a difference in eligibility depending on residency requirements, age, whether the child is a prescribed student, or the definition of income. The amendments that Senator Harradine has brought forward address those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) might stand up&mdash;I do not know whether she is going to; I do not have a crystal ball&mdash;and pick holes in these amendments. But if she does, I will say to her, `You had your chance, minister, when I moved an amendment during the second reading debate to move your own amendments to address the concerns that are being expressed by Senator Harradine and by the coalition. If you pick holes in Senator Harradine's amendments, which we have not been able to identify because we do not have the same resources that you have, then you stand condemned'. She had the opportunity to bring these amendments before us and she did not do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was confirmed in a letter from George Gear to Senator Lees that the old disability spouse rebate for dependent spouses with children will be abolished altogether. This means that families who are prevented from transferring to the home child-care allowance, due, as I said, to residency requirements, age, or income definitions, or the fact that they are prescribed students, will not even be able to claim the dependent spouse rebate at the dependent spouse with children rate. They will be able to receive the dependent spouse rebate only at the lower rate for dependent spouses without children. This means that such families will be $237 worse off than they are now. They will be $372 worse off than families with dependent spouses and children receiving the home child-care allowance. Why are these families worse off? As I said, they are worse off because they do not fulfil the residency requirements, because of the age of the student, because families have prescribed students, or because there are differences in the definition of income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that many of those families who heard the pea and thimble promise by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that a person at home was going to get $30 ever understood that the dependent spouse rebate was going to be taken away and a small increase of $2.60 added to it to form the home child-care allowance. As I said before in the second reading debate, it really was a sleight of hand on the part the Prime Minister. But it seems to me that because of this sleight of hand, a number of families have missed out. Senator Harradine has tried to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to confirm this: it is my understanding that public servants on postings would not be disadvantaged. Senator Harradine mentioned diplomats and others. I would like that clarified. But I would like the minister to clarify whether people such as missionaries, aid workers, and families of academics who are on study leave, who fulfil all the other requirements would be disadvantaged because they are away from Australia for more than 13 weeks. I would like to hear the minister's response to how the government can justify that these families are going to miss out. I would also like her to explain why Mr Keating did not make it clear to these families before the last election that they were going to miss out on this home child-care allowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to begin by commenting on the process that we went through last Wednesday. The Democrats were concerned that the opposition did not have its amendments ready. Once we understood that Senator Harradine had spent time in preparing amendments and that those amendments were almost ready, we came to the conclusion that we should wait until today to complete the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill. Anybody who happens to be listening today and did not hear what was said last Wednesday should understand that we had a problem with the fact that the Liberal Party was effectively asking the government to write its amendments for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not an easy issue; it is not simply black and white that we must do this and should not do that. I think we have to begin first by looking at those families who are going to miss out. For some families it is going to be in the order of the full $4.50 a week. I think Senator Harradine has set this out quite well. This is going to involve families who are travelling overseas and, in particular, those families with young people&mdash;I guess we should not really call them young people; we should call them adults&mdash;up to the ages of 25. Effectively, the government is bringing this back in line with the social security requirements rather than the tax requirements. Indeed, I hope that the government also looks at its Austudy definitions of when a young person becomes independent and perhaps reduces that down to the age that we are looking at here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far what has been missing in this debate is any talk at all of those families who will benefit. We have to look at this as a package. The Democrats looked at this very carefully this morning. In particular, we looked at people such as farm families who previously did not get the dependent spouse rebate because their taxable incomes were so low&mdash;in some cases, negative; as they did not pay tax, they could not very well get rebates back again. There are at least some 55,000 families in the category of seasonal workers and people in a range of casual jobs who have never received the dependent spouse rebate. So for Senator Harradine to say that there are no overall budget implications for what he is proposing suggests that we are not really taking a balanced look at this package as a whole; and that, if we have money to spare, we are not looking at exactly where it should go and how it should be spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are not, at this point in time, disposed to support these amendments. We believe the package is an improvement for low income families. Family payments such as this payment will go, not to the dependent spouse, but to the carer who is taking primary responsibility for children in the home. I stress that our definition of children is not somebody aged 19, 20 or up to 25 years of age. Those people are entitled, we believe, to an amount of money in their own names. In making these changes, we have to consider the balance, the total package and the effect it has on all families, and the relative level of need of all those families who, in particular, are going to benefit from the way this issue is being handled. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So how do we get the balance right? The balance in this case skews in favour of people at the lower end of income. It will go to those 55,000 families whose tax bill is so low that they are not able to fully benefit from the dependent spouse rebate. Under the HCCA arrangements they will get the full $30 a week once they cease work and their income falls below the income levels. I do not believe we can stress that too strongly. A huge number of families stand to benefit because the arrangement to switch from the tax system into the HCCA system will make that payment an advantage to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine asked whether I could make clear why these changes are being made. I think it is very clear that the definitions that are of concern&mdash;and I think this was properly raised by Senator Harradine&mdash;occur because of the move to treat this payment as social security rather than taxation. There would be great confusion if these definitions were not brought into line with other definitions under social security. This brings the definition in respect of social security payments within the one set of definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine raised the definition of income and the principal point might relate to the different treatment of shares. For example, someone with a parcel of shares and a deemed capital gain may be in a position to lose some of that income if the income is that of a pensioner. That does not happen under the tax system; deemed income does not occur when considering income under the taxation system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best estimates that we can give&mdash;they are guesstimates as there are no hard figures here&mdash;indicate that the number of people in that kind of position, and therefore eligible for a little less under the dependent spouse rebate, would be very few. We know that at least 55,000 families will benefit with the changed definition from tax into social security, or into HCCA, but the number of families which might be caught by this altered definition of income is, on the best evidence I have been given, very small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine also raised the concern about, for example, a child no longer being defined as a child once he or she turns 16. Under the HCCA arrangements such a payment on behalf of children ceases, particularly if the child is on Austudy. To be exact, for those families to be eligible under the current arrangement for a DSR payment on behalf of children&mdash;that is, the higher rate of DSR&mdash;the children have to be getting Austudy of less than $1,785 a year. Once their Austudy payment goes over $1,785 a year, under the current arrangements they would not be eligible for the higher rate of DSR. I am referring not just to income from Austudy but any income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not divided $1,785 by 50, but it is in the area of $30 or $40. The figure is less than $40 a week. Clearly a lot of youngsters in the age range of 16 to 18 who stack shelves at Coles, load trolleys in a supermarket yard or pull a bit of petrol over the weekend would get an income that might take them over $1,785 a year. The DSR arrangements are very generous as they are but the estimate of the number of children over 16 not earning $1,785 a year one way or another&mdash;either through Austudy or part-time work&mdash;would be very small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On balance one would have to say that for the 55,000 families which under these new definitions will distinctly benefit by getting the full $30 per week for the spouse at home&mdash;and it commences immediately they cease work and stay at home&mdash;this is an offset. I am not saying that they will benefit and the others will lose, but when one looks at the balances between one system and the other, the case can be made that the definitions that give concern will affect a very modest number of families, whereas the change to move from DSR out of tax into HCCA will be a huge benefit to 55,000 or more families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the residential issue, again it is a matter of bringing consistency into the definitions, or at least to approach consistency within the social security definitions. I can certainly clear up a number of the examples that have been raised. The number of government employees overseas fluctuates each year, but it is estimated that about 1,500 government families posted overseas will be affected. However, there are mechanisms in place to compensate government employees posted overseas for any shortfall they may have as a result of their overseas postings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The majority of Defence Force families remain in Australia when a member of those families is posted overseas, so in fact a Defence Force overseas posting will not affect the eligibility of those families for family payment. As far as I can tell, students overseas, missionaries and people working for Community Aid Abroad or World Vision will be affected after 13 weeks. But some of those people while overseas may be reimbursed by their employers through a specific arrangement for the loss of that payment. That is not a matter for the government to determine but a matter  for the employer concerned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The best advice that the department has been able to get from the tax office is that the figure is about 50 per cent. There is no requirement on taxpayers to take a PAYE arrangement. It is a matter on which people will make an election. Some taxpayers, quite clearly, elect to wait until the end of the year and take their dependent spouse rebate at that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big distinction which is very important is that, whether it is a PAYE tax arrangement or a HCCA arrangement, under HCCA, the money is paid to the carer. It is not just an extra amount in salary that comes into the family which may never get to the carer. To the extent that the carers are women&mdash;and the majority will be, and are&mdash;and on the evidence from any number of research documents, we know that a lot of the money in a husband's salary does not get through to the wife. Indeed, that is one of the reasons that this is a distinct benefit and why so many families, particularly so many women, are looking forward to it. They know that income will be coming directly to them. It is not something they will have to negotiate about. It is known, on other measured arrangements, that money going to women on behalf of children is spent on children. There is a lot of evidence to support this point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Panizza that there are distinct differences. With regard to the figures from tax, at the margin, we would have to agree to differ. They are the best figures that tax is providing to the department. Let me stress again that the most important difference is that under the tax system it is not paid to the carer. As I say, that is a very significant, watershed difference in the exciting, new benefit under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to be quite clear about definitions, in answer to Senator Harradine in particular and also to Senator Patterson. In transferring the home child-care allowance into the social security system, the government has tried to align it as closely as possible to the family payments structure. The basic family payment is payable if the family is temporarily absent for up to three years. An additional family payment is only payable overseas for up to 13 weeks if one partner is away and both children and the other partner remain in Australia. The home child-care allowance will be paid overseas for up to 13 weeks if the children or one or both partners travel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extending the home child-care allowance to three years, or forever, would make it far more generous than the additional family payment&mdash;a payment that is targeted to very low income families.

I have never had any argument about that; perhaps it should have been done before. Getting back to the spouse rebate for those with children, did the minister look at the option, with regard to the ones who are satisfied with the weekly or fortnightly rebate of $27.35 or whatever it is, of staying with the present system if the carer of the children signs a declaration that she or he is happy with it? After all, the ones without children receive, under the present system, a rebate of about $22.10. Of course, some people would not be inclined to go to a social security office. It should be noted that people have to put down a tax file number as well, whereas with the present rebate, only the one who is working has to give a tax file number. So if the carer is willing to sign a form that she&mdash;as it is in most cases&mdash;is happy with it, I think she should be given that option.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate the support of the Greens for Senator Harradine's amendments. There are two reasons for this support. The first reason is the understanding that this legislation should not disadvantage families previously in receipt of the maximum DSR. Senator Harradine said very succinctly that these amendments are in support of the status quo and an avoidance of detriment. Under this legislation, a family with a student on Austudy will lose between $230 and $300 a year and a family receiving the overseas allowance could lose $380 a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason that we are supporting these amendments is that, while I accept the argument of the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) that huge numbers of families will benefit from the change and we do feel that the move from the taxation system to the social security system has some advantages, there are also disadvantages. While the government is taking this payment from the tax rebate position to a benefit position&mdash;we acknowledge that is a considerable conceptual leap&mdash;it does increase involuntary inclusion on Department of Social Security lists. As Senator Panizza raised earlier, there is a question of whether this should be voluntary and be available to those who want to apply for the benefit, rather than automatically including them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government advice, which we do not accept&mdash;it argued not to support these amendments&mdash;is that this benefit is not available to sole parents with children overseas. It is only through these amendments to the home child-care allowance that the overseas benefit would extend beyond the 13-week period. This does not, in our opinion, justify not allowing it and disadvantaging those who currently enjoy that right through the previous DSR arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that we should not argue to remove this possible benefit but instead argue to make it available to sole parents as well. So the principle is that children's allowances in these circumstances should be determined by their situation and not according to whether they have two parents or one. In conclusion, on the principle that families should not be worse off under this legislation than they were under the former DSR conditions, we will be supporting Senator Harradine's amendments.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am fascinated that Senator Chamarette should begin her remarks by citing Senator Harradine's `preservation of the status quo' because, if we were to preserve the status quo, 55,000 families would stand not to benefit. Preservation of the status quo is a very good definition of no change at all. Senator Harradine actually argues for preservation of the status quo, and Senator Chamarette so ably presented it to this chamber as a definition or a justification for supporting his amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preservation of the status quo would have been the very thing that allowed us not to move from the tax system to the social security system; would have allowed 55,000 families not to be advantaged; would have allowed the current inequities, I suppose, under the tax system of that payment actually going into a household payment; and would have allowed it not very often or not ever to be seen by the carer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here is a piece of legislation which, as Senator Chamarette said, offers conceptual change. That is exactly what this legislation does. I have said on a number of occasions that this is a watershed piece of legislation. It is something that many groups in the community, particularly women, have fought for for years because the status quo was not giving them access to money on behalf of themselves or their children. It sometimes went into the family pot, and many families of course happily adjusted. But we also know of very many families where it was very unhappily not accessible to that spouse at home, usually the wife. Preserving the status quo would not have assisted all those families; it would have perpetuated families where children and wives had to suffer because the payment was not going to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price we pay for making this conceptual change is that very small numbers of people in a couple of categories will possibly not have access to the same advantage that they had before. That is the price that Senator Chamarette is asking me to forgo to preserve the status quo. I find that argument totally unpersuasive because, if we had not made this change, if we had not recognised the advantage to the parent at home&mdash;usually the mother&mdash;of cashing out this payment, we would have a less targeted payment. We would also not have the opportunity to recognise the important work the spouse at home is doing in caring for children, and we would not have the opportunity to make sure that a continuing, albeit modest, income continues to be paid to those spouses when they are out of the work force. The benefits of moving to the home child-care allowance and away from the tax system and its dependent spouse rebate are very persuasive, very overwhelming and are not the status quo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a lot of us would have considerable sympathy for avoidance of detriment, but what we are seeking here is a balance. We are saying that the detriment is modest, it involves small numbers; and the benefits are huge. So, on balance, the definitions and the consistency that occur in moving this allowance away from the tax office and into the social security system are more than defensible; they are very justifiable.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am. By the way, my amendments do not depend on this, but it is a bit of fun. The definition of `income' in the social security legislation includes a periodic payment by way of gift or allowance or a periodic benefit by way of gift or allowance. That is part of the definition in the Social Security Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act goes on to exclude domestic payments, but in the Social Security Act `domestic payment' has a meaning given by subsection 3 of section 8 and provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a payment received by a person is a domestic payment for the purposes of this act if (a) the person receives the payment on the disposal of an asset of the person (b) the asset was used immediately before the disposal by the person or the person's partner for private or domestic purposes and (c) the asset was used by the person or person's partner for those purposes for (i) a period of 12 months before the disposal or (ii) if the secretary considers it appropriate a period of less than 12 months before the disposal.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what it says about income; it is interesting, is it not? If the literal interpretation holds, any payment that is made by a husband to a wife on a regular basis is income for the purposes of the social security legislation. It is a very interesting question although a diversion from the main area of concern. I certainly would be interested in being shown the part of the social security legislation that says it is not to be regarded as income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leaving that very interesting diversion to one side, I come back to the burden of my amendments. Let me not argue, as the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) has tended to do in this committee stage, about the principles of the legislation. We could argue forever about the treatment meted out to those parents who prefer or choose to care for their children at home compared with the treatment of those who choose or are required to place their children in institutional child care. There is no way that a spouse with a net gain of $2.60 a week will feel that that is a true recognition of the value of the work that he or she does at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bear in mind the point made by Senator Panizza. No doubt he was asking those questions because a number of people in the paid work force will have $27.40 less in their pay packet from September of this year and will be a bit concerned about it. At some other stage I will be asking how the government intends to ensure that people take up HCCA. If one spouse says that he or she will not give his or her TFN, the government may not be able to compel it. There is a provision in the legislation for waiver, but how long will people have to wait for that to occur?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know at some stage how many wage and salary earners receive the HCCA payments weekly or fortnightly, as compared with the DSR, because they have put in a concession form. The minister has said that, of persons in receipt of the dependent spouse rebate, 50 percent get it every year and 50 percent get it fortnightly. I do not suggest the minister would know the answer now, but I would like an answer at some stage, if possible. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, he is also right about creating diversions, which is not something of a novelty for Senator Harradine. He is good at it, and it was a good diversion. But if he were to go out into the community and say, `We regard regular payment of income from a husband to a wife as assessable for the purpose of this, that and the other thing', his own political astuteness would tell him that that would not be a winnable argument&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking about winnable arguments, but about legal definition.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine says it is definitional, but I am saying that, politically, it would not be a winnable argument. How would he establish regular transfer and all those other things? It is very clear, in common and colloquial understanding, that if the husband passes some of his pay packet to his wife, it is not regarded as income for the purpose of these definitions. I do not think there is any doubt about that nor that it is in dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make a couple of points clear. There was the odd flourish of rhetoric from Senator Chamarette. She is not going to delete that from her repertoire. She was quoting me lines such as `resistance to change'. I do not mind responding with a little flourish now and then myself. If she is minded to support Senator Harradine, she needs to understand that, essentially, she is saying that there is justification for a family with a 24-year-old student being eligible for HCCA while all families lose the basic family payment when the child reaches 18. On the one hand, she is saying that a sole parent pensioner should lose the pension when his or her child turns 16; on the other hand she is saying, `We are here to preserve the rights of a 24-year-old student to the higher level of dependent spouse rebate now cashed out as HCCA'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, as far as achieving balance is concerned, that is not a very defensible position. Secondly, it is hard to imagine any 24-year-old student who does not earn $1,785 under the current arrangement; and those who do are currently not eligible for the higher rebate. Thirdly, as I understand it, as long as one child in a family is 16 or under, HCCA will continue. If there are three or four children in a family, provided one child is under 16, the HCCA payment will continue to that family. Therefore, students aged 18, 19 and 20 can still be eligible under this legislation. I am asking Senator Chamarette to rethink her position because, by the time we take those bits and pieces out, the amendment that Senator Harradine has moved will be very small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I like the way the argument goes here. If the government takes something away from people, to quote Senator Harradine, we are `stripping them of their payments'. If the government is paying something, he calls it a `miserly, mean little bit of money'. Senator Harradine should make up his mind because we are talking about the same amount of money. Whether the government is stripping people of a great advantage or paying them a miserly little bit, depends on how one looks at the argument. It is a good argument and a good piece of theatre from Senator Harradine&mdash;I do not mind it at all; he should take a curtain call&mdash;but we are talking about the same amount of money. The 55,000 or more families who will enjoy the home child-care allowance, cashed out in their hands each fortnight at a slightly higher rate, will not necessarily regard it as a miserly little bit of payment. On all the evidence that I have, they cannot wait for that payment to start. If it is a major asset that is being stripped from families for students, we should be a little more generous in the way we view what the government is paying. Those families are looking forward to that payment and will find it a big advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine almost raised his voice about the injustice of comparing the cash rebate to the home child-care allowance. Out in the community somehow some people are being persuaded that this home child-care allowance is not a great or very significant payment. It is an extraordinary change. We have all agreed that it is conceptually very important. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For many women it is $30 because they have never seen the other $26 or $27 and they will be very appreciative that they will now benefit from it. The payment has gone from $2.60 to $2.65 to $2.70 to $2.87. Thus we are talking about an increase of $3 a week extra for the cash dependent spouse rebate. However, Senator Harradine argues that this is a miserly amount of money and persists in comparing that with $60 paid to a family, with no income test, for child care&mdash;a millionaire's cash rebate!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put some facts on the record. The home child-care allowance is a maximum flat rate of $30 a week, irrespective of the number of children in the family. The child-care cash rebate is $28.20 a week for one child and $61.20 for two or more children. Unlike the home child-care allowance, one does not just get it. One has to spend three times that amount of money on child care with an accredited child-care provider to be eligible for the rebate. It is not a handout&mdash;`Here's the money;  go spend it on child care'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one spends at least $110 for one child or $220 for two children with a registered carer in a licensed child-care arrangement, formal or informal, one is eligible for up to $61.20 a week. So it is not an exact comparison to say, `You're getting a miserly $2, but the person over there is getting $61'. That is not a fair comparison. I have never heard anyone from the other side argue that we spend a very large number of child-care dollars on the occasional care which is specifically provided for parents at home. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, that is so. Senator Harradine must not shake his head like that because that is a clear indication that he has either not understood or he is determined not to understand it. There are also payments to assist parents with the care of their children in the community, particularly occasional care and the allocation of money for playgroups.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> More could be said about comparing women at home to women in the work force, but the argument that is being run at the moment is a sad one. It goes back to the days when women at home were set up to be at war with women in the workplace. We know that most women in their adult lives will spend some time at home and some time in the workplace. They are being assisted by this government in the move from one place to another, into or out of work, from the home into the workplace. They are being given assistance by way of child care, by changed arrangements to give them opportunities to study and train and assistance in employment. They are now being assisted with the home child-care allowance&mdash;a payment that recognises the contribution of the spouse, usually the mother at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, the arguments for this legislation far outstrip the arguments that it should be amended in the way suggested by Senator Harradine. I take the points raised by the honourable senator, but I do not find them persuasive in the overall scheme of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last question that Senator Harradine asked&mdash;and it was a point raised by Senator Panizza&mdash;was how we would police whether or not people are taking up the home child-care allowance. We will not have to because it is a voluntary arrangement. Families do not have to apply for home child-care allowance if they do not wish to, but I will be very surprised if they do not. As the dependent spouse rebate at the higher rate will not exist, families will be eligible to continue to get the dependent spouse rebate. But most families who have the option of a lower amount of money paid by the tax system into the husband's account or a larger amount of money paid directly to them per fortnight will not face too hard a choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that right at the beginning Senator Harradine moved amendments Nos 1 and 2 standing in his name. I did actually throw out the challenge to the minister that if there were problems associated with those amendments, they should have been highlighted. If the minister thought that there were problems, why did she not raise any issues about the first amendment? I did say during the second reading debate that the minister had every opportunity to address the issues that Senator Harradine was trying to address in those amendments. With my amendment to the second reading, I gave her that opportunity. I called on the minister with her resources to deal with what is a very difficult issue.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have had all the arguments about being advantaged and the benefits of the change to the social security legislation so that the carer at home would receive the money and we are not arguing with any of that. What we are saying is that there is a very small group of people who, because of the income test or because of other definitions of the length of time they were overseas, will be disadvantaged. We believe that these people should not be disadvantaged&mdash;people who are aid workers overseas, young academics on the lower income scale trying to benefit or advance themselves, students, or exchange students overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the bill came from the House of Representatives with concerns, let me say on the record that the minister had her opportunity twice over&mdash;in the second reading debate and here today&mdash;to raise those concerns.

I assume that the government is doing this to avoid a tax liability for a couple on unemployment benefits. Is this entrenching into legislation the principle of income splitting?

Senator Harradine mentioned this in the debate and I thought she might have considered that option at the weekend.

I wonder whether that is also importing into the social security legislation a new definition of means testing? The minister has been complaining that we possibly have two criteria for income testing for the purposes of the social security legislation. Is it a fact that this will import a new definition or a new provision for means testing HCCA? If so, does she, on the basis of uniformity, feel that that is appropriate?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the committee has raised some issues which should be reviewed in the future. These include: public access to information; cost recovery, including community service obligations; third party appeals; and control of use of chemical products after retail sale. In this regard, I would like to point out that in the development of the national registration scheme, the establishment of the National Registration Authority and the preparation of these bills, there has been an almost unprecedented level of consultation with all stakeholders&mdash;including community, environment and public interest organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the exposure draft bills benefited substantially from being released for public comment.

Notwithstanding this comprehensive program of consultation, I am happy to agree to the recommendation that the agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation will be reviewed after 18 to 20 months of operation to address the issues noted above. Furthermore, I note the dissenting report by Senator Bell raises the same issues; however, Senator Bell argues that they should be addressed now rather than in 18 to 20 months. I agree with the committee's views that the issues should be considered after a suitable period of operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of submissions presented to the committee expressed concern about control of use matters. I wish to make the point that the Commonwealth has only limited powers in this field&mdash;for example, use by trading corporations, use in the territories, and use in the course of interstate trade. In general, these matters constitutionally are state responsibilities. It needs to be recognised by all of us that without the states' agreement to enact further legislation, there are constitutional impediments imposed on the Commonwealth relating to the measures it can take in respect of control of use of chemical products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I emphasise that the Agricultural and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand has requested the agricultural and veterinary chemicals policy committee to examine the issue of control of use. A working party has been established, which includes representatives from the National Farmers Federation and the chemical industry. The terms of reference include defining the scope of control of use activities; developing an equitable mechanism for funding control of use programs; taking into account the recommendations of the Prices Surveillance Inquiry into the price of farm chemicals; and recommending the most appropriate way to harmonise control of use programs across the states and territories. </PARA>

This will be more effective and efficient for all concerned. I thank the Senate. </PARA>

Importantly, this legislation is supported by the agricultural and veterinary chemicals industry, the National Farmers Federation, Commonwealth agencies involved in the scheme, and state and territory agricultural agencies. The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Bill imposes the Agvet code in the Australian Capital Territory.

Originally, the government said the requirement would be phased in over four years, but it is now anticipated that the scheme's costs will be fully recovered in 1995-96, with well over 80 per cent in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRA will be responsible for assessing whether a levy payment is required in the amount of that levy. Normally, the levy will be based on the sale or disposal of chemical products. Hopefully, this body will keep its administration lean so that costs do not get out of hand. No-one wants another body like AQIS in terms of the relationship between its efficiency and operating costs and the burden those activities place on industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code Bill is the major component of the package. It enables the NRA to evaluate and, if it is satisfied on grounds of human and environmental safety, to approve the active constituents to Agvet chemical products, to register the products enabling their lawful possession and sale, and, importantly, to approve the label which must be affixed to the container. The bill also allows the NRA to license manufacturers of those chemicals. The overriding criteria to be addressed by the NRA include public health, occupational health and safety, the environment, product performance, and trade and commerce. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NRA can also reconsider an existing registered chemical product to ensure that it continues to meet current safety and performance standards. The authority may suspend or cancel the registration if appropriate. Permits to use unregistered chemicals may be issued for trials or experiments in order to determine whether an application for registration should be made. The legislation also allows the National Registration Authority to consider the results of any trials or experiments carried out in other countries. The aim is to remove unnecessary duplication and expense for companies which have developed and/or registered products overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advantages of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are well acknowledged. The Bureau of Rural Resources, as it was then known, in evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals in Australia, claimed that if farm chemicals were not used, 30 per cent of the world's agricultural product would be lost, in addition to the 20 to 40 per cent which was lost annually because of the effect of weeds, pests and diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Association, now known as Avcare, in evidence to the same committee, estimated that in 1988 the value of increased production by Australian farmers, resulting from the use of pesticides in their activities, amounted to $3.2 billion per year. Avcare also estimated that the withdrawal of chemicals from Australian agriculture would have reduced farm output in 1988 by some $7 billion. The complete withdrawal of sheep blowfly treatments alone would have caused production losses of some $465 million per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Avcare believes, and its belief is reinforced by evidence from the United States, that every dollar spent on Agvet chemicals adds $4 to the value of Australian production. It is estimated that in 1992-93, Australian farmers spent $720 million on agricultural chemicals and a further $290 million on veterinary chemicals&mdash;a total of just over $1 billion; boosting agricultural production by a massive $4 billion annually. The benefits, in other words, are extremely substantial. Reduced or minimum tillage in agricultural production, cropping production, provides a great example of the benefits to agricultural production. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ongoing study and  research in this area will obviously expand knowledge and improve results as we work towards managing sustainable development in agriculture in this country. Certainly, the wise and sensible use of chemicals has an extremely important role in maintaining agricultural production and, at the same time, helping to maintain the quality and diversity of our soils. Agricultural agriculture is an enormous employer of technology and of modern methods. For example, an Australian company is seeking permission to run field trials of cotton plants which have been genetically engineered to improve their resistance to caterpillars and, paradoxically, the herbicide Round-up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to make some brief comments about the coal strike which is currently spreading outside New South Wales to Queensland. Nobody, especially the 25,000 coalminers employed in New South Wales and Queensland, can seriously believe the latest strike will cause a renegotiation of the Japanese coking coal prices. In fact, it will have quite the opposite effect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australian coal executives sit down with the Japanese again next year this strike will be used as an example of how unreliable Australia can be and could be, and it can only force prices down further. Tonight I appeal to the average Australian coalminer to look objectively at the results of the current strike. I appeal to them to look beyond the rhetoric spun by their hardline, myopic coal union leaders. There are other ways to pass on a message to their bosses&mdash;ways acceptable to both parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it simply, this strike is the equivalent of cutting their own throats. Coal companies face a $26 million a day bill for as long as the mines remain closed. Further, our trade reputation is being irreparably damaged in the international marketplace, which boasts a number of companies and countries that can supply the Japanese coking coal requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's national debt blows out even further while these strikes continue. The strikes will achieve nothing. To expect coal companies to pay workers attending a rally at Parliament House tomorrow is sheer cheek. Some Queensland coalminers, reportedly, will not return home until Thursday because the buses the union has organised will not get back until that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout their wheeling and dealing with Japanese steel mills, Australian negotiators have had to steer a tortuous path between sustaining our market share on one hand and remaining viable on the other. I repeat that the surrounding examples of industrial instability do nothing to make us a reputable and credible supplier in the world marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the traditional and fierce competition we face in coal sales to Japan from countries such as Canada and the United States, there are emerging exporters like Venezuela, Chile and Indonesia. Unrealistic union proposals to get a better price for our coal will not be the industry saviour. More efficient work practices, greater capability to achieve improvements in productivity and an overall commitment to improving the industrial relations system is the saviour that we are looking for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are also looking for increased micro-economic reform in the ancillary areas such as ports and railways and overriding all those micro-economic reforms is more flexibility and, unfortunately, a further rationalisation of the pits. Once Australia's coalmines are running at peak efficiency they will be positioned to capitalise on an increased world demand which will come about by increased world economic recovery. When this occurs more people will be employed in the industry, and Australia as a whole will benefit enormously. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise for a few minutes this evening to express my personal thanks to the Australian Navy with which I shared 24 hours over last Friday and Saturday. In particular, I observed a wide range of naval exercises off the eastern coast of Australia on board <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Torrens</EMPHASIS>. It was an exhilarating experience for me, and one which I summarise as having led me to see the direct professionalism of our navy as exhibited by both officers and sailors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Friday morning I left Canberra as a passenger on board a Sea King helicopter that flew directly across New South Wales, over Nowra Airport, past Jervis Bay and the Shoalwater River, across the sea to land on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">HMAS Torrens</EMPHASIS>, a destroyer escort, which was in a fleet of Australian naval vessels. I was winched down from the Sea King helicopter to the bow of the ship, and so began a fascinating 24 hours of naval experience for me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recognise the two pilots on the Sea King helicopter and their two support crew. I happened to have met one of them on another occasion when I went by Sea King helicopter from Adelaide to welcome back <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Success</EMPHASIS> from the Gulf War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> is one of several destroyer escorts in our navy. It was commissioned in 1971. It has a displacement of 2,750 tonnes, a length of 113 metres and a beam of 12 1/2 metres. It has geared steam turbine engines developing 22,000 kilowatts. It has a speed capability of more than 30 knots. The ship's company is 250. Whilst it does not have a capacity for guided missiles, it does have a 4 1/2-inch gun. It has anti-submarine torpedo capabilities and is a very powerful ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On arrival I was welcomed by the captain of the ship,  Commander Warwick Gately, and the executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Stephen Hayes, with whom I spent a considerable time individually and together over the next 24 hours. I admire their professionalism. I was impressed by the enormous wealth of experience and knowledge that was reflected in every element of our discussions on every aspect of the ship and its capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was firstly taken to the bridge, to the operations room and officers' area, including the wardroom. Subsequently, at various intervals between exercises, I was shown every part of the ship. There was a man overboard drill. The officer of the watch was a trainee, and I was fascinated to see the responses&mdash;which I judged to be superb&mdash;of that trainee officer. The trainee officer happened to be a woman, but I am sure the other officers on board would have done an equally excellent job in performing that task which is set quite regularly on all our naval ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a replenishment at sea exercise whereby <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> drew alongside the supply ship <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Success</EMPHASIS> so fuel could be brought in to top up its tanks. This is quite a demanding exercise with minor adjustments having to be made to the direction and speed of the ship being serviced. It certainly demanded a great deal of vigilance on the part of the watch officers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> There was a double replenishment, the other being by cable to a jackstay at the rear of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS>. This was followed almost immediately by an air defence exercise in which Australian air force FA18s and F111s attacked the fleet, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS>, the ship that I was on. There were also New Zealand A4 Skyhawk aircraft that are distinguished by their ability to skim the waves, as it were, at very low height in coming in to attack a naval group.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the main demands of this exercise as far as navy was concerned was for the interpreting of radar signals and the translation of the risks from aircraft, not only for the particular ship, but for those being escorted, such as the logistics ship, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Success</EMPHASIS>, to ensure the best defences were put in place so that the ships were safe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite excited above decks to see these various aircraft whistling past at very low heights in bombing runs and the like, and also much more excited in the operations room to see 20 very well-trained naval officers working as five or six teams, coordinated by the officer translating the radar information to a gunnery command. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next exercise later the same afternoon was a submarine defence exercise based upon sonar readings. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> has a Mulloka sonar which is an extraordinarily well developed piece of equipment requiring a very sophisticated computer as well as a very carefully built&mdash;Australian built, I would even say South Australian built, by EMI&mdash;enhancement read-out, which was directly useful in this sonar exercise of defending the fleet against submarine attack, with a view to eliminating submarines attacking the fleet. I will not go into detail, as I imagine some of the detail I was given remains classified, with regard to the capabilities of the Mulloka sonar equipment, but it was splendid to have that explained to me as a visiting senator and to see it in an operational exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in the afternoon I was invited to put on fire protection gear and go into the gun, which is about as big as a small room, all on a swivel. It has two barrels. Inside this gun there is a team of six sailors, two loading a breech on one side and two loading a breech on the other. There is a coordinating sailor looking above the two breeches and a person virtually in a periscope position at the top. Whilst the gun was firing there were another half a dozen sailors on the deck below the gun, feeding shells up so they could be placed into the gun. At rapid fire, it was an enormously strenuous activity requiring split second timing. They had to be right on time to make sure the gun kept up its firing rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stood right next to the sailors loading the breeches. I was also able subsequently to leave that rotating gun, go back up to the bridge and watch the impact of the shells that were fired from this enormous gun. When I say enormous, it is a 4 1/2 inch gun. The larger ships in our fleet have automatic loading of such guns. This one is not automatic. It requires the work of about 10 sailors. It is about a 40-year-old mechanism, but I witnessed it to be a very formidable gun. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise went on and on. There was no stopping for the ship's company. It was virtually a 24-hour exercise while I was on board, and had been preceded by exercises for some days. I think there was still a day or two to go. In the early hours of the morning, for about five hours there was the encounterex surface engagement exercise in which three ships in the fleet were sussing out three other ships and, by turning off their radar or by other subterfuges, they evaded the others, thus exercising one other capability required of our naval vessels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the midst of all of this, I was taken on a tour of every part of the ship, including the gearing mechanism, from the turbines to the gears to the propeller, which require a constant watch of four naval personnel. Similarly, in another even hotter area, in the base of the ship, there is a series of eight elements in one side of the boilers for one engine of the ship, with the same on the starboard side of the ship. There was a very exacting requirement to watch water levels and pressure points. I was quite struck by the attentiveness of those sailors in the way they were conducting themselves in a quite difficult environment in terms of heat and noise for some hours of their watch. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my tour of the ship I went to all external and internal areas, including eating areas for sailors, petty officers and officers&mdash;three separate areas. The captain eats alone. I had the evening meal with the captain and was able to discuss a wide range of topics with him and ask his advice. I saw the sleeping areas for all elements of the crew, including one mess containing 30 bunks, three high, in an area that I do not think would be experienced by anyone in Australia in terms of such close confinement. There is no doubt that the sailors on board any of our ships are required to be a team, that they are a team and that they really do live cheek by jowl in our ships. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I saw the ablutions areas for all levels of crew of the ship. In particular, I looked at the facilities for women on board the ship. All of our ships need to be ready to take both men and women together. Certainly, what I saw on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> was well thought out and, I believe, very adequate for men and women serving together on a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the officers, petty officers and sailors who were my hosts in what was for me a marvellous visit to one of our naval vessels. I refer to Commander Warwick Gateley, the captain; Lieutenant Commander Stephen Hayes, the executive officer; Lieutenant David Lantry, the mechanical engineering officer; Lieutenant Commander Stewart Winslade; Lieutenant Commander David Sandwell; and Lieutenant Heath Robertson, the navigating officer. There were four females on board, some of whom I met, including the senior one of those on board, Lieutenant Michele Miller. I was delighted to see her displaying such self-confidence and authority when she was officer of the watch. I also met on board the chaplain, some of the division chiefs and some of the sailors, most of whom I did not get to know by name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had asked to sleep in one of the ship's triple bunks. So it happened that I climbed on board at about 1.30 in the morning and into the top bunk with at least a foot between my nose and the pipes of the deck above. I had a very comfortable night's sleep in clean sheets and with a cool air vent ventilating the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I especially wish to mention the deputy maritime commander, Commodore Chris Barrie, who was also on board the ship. He arrived differently from me but left with me on the Sea King helicopter. I was most grateful that we had the chance to be together on the ship for a fair proportion of the time that I was on board. He certainly answered my questions about all sorts of aspects of the ship that were unfamiliar to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also met on board Commander John McAree, commander sea training who, together with a sea training group, comprised an inspectorate that had come on board to evaluate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> in its capabilities on each of these exercises&mdash;that is, there was an independent monitor of professional sailors from the navy who were carrying out their own evaluations. I was happy to meet with them. I thank Captain Robertson and his staff from navy here in Canberra, who liaised with my office and made arrangements for this visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have observed a very professional navy. As a senator, I have had the privilege of observing navy personnel when they appear before us in estimates committees or in a Senate inquiry such as the one currently under way. I am deputy chairman of that inquiry into sexual harassment and the need to ensure that we have solutions to overcome sexual harassment in the three defence services. I have now had the privilege of seeing the navy fully exercising at sea, and of observing 250 personnel coordinating as a team and bringing to bear the professional knowledge and skills that are required of each member of that team. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I was about to be winched off <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> to come back to Sydney, flying via the Wollongong coast and eventually into Botany Bay, I was delighted that the captain, Commander Gateley, and the No. 2 officer on board, executive officer Lieutenant Commander Stephen Hayes put on their naval caps and, on the bridge, gave me the honour of presenting to me a plaque of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS>, which is now already displayed in my room here in Parliament House. They also gave me the same issue of T-shirt and naval cap that is common to their sailors. I assure the sailors of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> that I wore them with a great sense of honour when I went surfing yesterday with my third son. I note that the motto of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Torrens</EMPHASIS> is `Faith and fortitude'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export capacity of the North West Shelf is largely committed under long term contracts to major Japanese power and gas utilities. There is short term excess capacity which has allowed spot sales, including one to South Korea and several sales to Spain. These spot sales, which are subject to Government price approval, are small compared with the long term volumes committed to Japanese buyers.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South Korea is forecast to require around 15 million tonnes of LNG a year by early next century and Australia, with its long term development opportunities, will be well placed to meet future Korean demand. To this end, the Government has facilitated discussions between Australia's potential suppliers and buyers of LNG including South Korea. One such mechanism is the High Level Group discussions on energy held periodically by officials of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy with their counterparts in a number of Asian countries, including meetings which involve industry representation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to iron ore and coal contracts, it is important to realise that many long-term contracts provide for actual prices and tonnage to be re-negotiated on an annual basis. In these annual negotiations, exporters naturally expect to have to meet the conditions prevailing in the market at that time. Annual prices and tonnage therefore depend heavily on supply and demand factors, which in turn reflect the extent of competition in the market at that time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the nexus implied in the honourable senator's question, between the sale of different commodities to Japan and prices paid, it is important to draw a distinction between iron ore and coal contracts which are negotiated on an annual basis, and LNG contracts which are on a long term take or pay basis. The latter are currently linked to movements in crude oil prices and are not subject to annual price re-negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government welcomes, where feasible, further exports of LNG to countries other than Japan. However, this would be a commercial decision involving investment and long term commitment to new development and/or expansion of North West Shelf capacity.</PARA>
