<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night when the time allowed for this debate ran out I was speaking in response to the motion by Senator Ferguson to disallow the determination for the salary package&mdash;as I suppose it can be put, in common terms&mdash;for Mr Kelly to be an adviser to the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. I want to put on the record the general description of the job that Mr Kelly would perform as an adviser.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of my remarks last night I was explaining that a major part of the Conroy report dealt with the way Customs had introduced new technology. The report said that Customs has been a world leader of any Customs department in doing that, and has been recognised at an international level around the world for chairing committees&mdash;in particular, one of the initial committees established by APEC to look at the harmonisation of customs law and rules within our region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, despite the criticism in the Conroy review about internal management et cetera, there was strong commendation in that part of the report about Customs for things that it had done at an international level and at a technological level. The government believes that Mr Kelly must take some of the credit for that, because he was a senior officer in Customs as comptroller-general and as deputy of the department before that, and that cannot be ignored. We believe that Mr Kelly is very suitable as special adviser to DITARD on APEC matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the APEC ministers in Seattle in November 1993 confirmed to the government the importance to Australia of involvement with the regional groupings through such initiatives as harmonisation of customs procedures, harmonisation of standards and conference procedures, promoting technology transfer between APEC economies and improving market access for Australian manufacturing and service industries within the APEC region. Because of the direct beneficial impact on trade and investment these initiatives will have for Australia, the industry, technology and regional development portfolio&mdash;my portfolio&mdash;will be substantially increasing its involvement in these areas over the next two to three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The role performed by Mr Kelly in maximising the potential gain for Australia in this area has been carefully considered by the department with an interest in APEC matters. His position will involve encouraging interaction of complementary APEC activities within the portfolio and with other departments and agencies; ensuring a commercial orientation of the portfolio's APEC activities that is relevant to business priorities in the region; and representing the portfolio at appropriate APEC meetings. Mr Kelly is well qualified to perform the task of special adviser by virtue of his international experience in customs, particularly in the APEC context where he was involved from the earlier stages in developing a customs theme to encourage trade facilitation through harmonisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Public Service Commissioner was willing to make the determination that the salary package for Mr Kelly as an adviser for these responsibilities was quite appropriate in view of his experience and, as I said before, the Conroy review not criticising Customs. It commended Customs for what it has done in the area of introducing new technology into its international obligation. In the criticisms being made, I acknowledge the management problems internally and domestically, but I hope that honourable senators, particularly those opposite, will keep some balance in the debate that is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said last night that Senator Ferguson's comments in this matter showed a lot of preparation and forethought, and I congratulate him on that. Although I do not agree with the thrust of his remarks, at least they show he has put a lot of effort into this issue compared with some of the hot air windbagging and grandstanding of some other honourable senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson raised the question of how we remove a statutory office holder if there is, as he claimed, incompetence and so on. There are three ways to remove a statutory office holder. One of the ways is by resignation, which is what happened. As I have said before, I had discussions with Mr Kelly and, in consideration of the Conroy review, he agreed to resign from the position of comptroller-general, which is a statutory position. Another way to remove an office holder is by a joint resolution of the houses. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ferguson raised the ways, if Mr Kelly deserved to go, other than through resignation. Achieving it through the resolution of both houses, I would have thought, in the end might not have brought great credit to the Senate or to the House of Representatives. The debate would have been about a personality. There would have been questions of natural justice and how he could defend himself. He would not have been able to participate in the debate. Those issues would have been raised. We may have ended up with a process going on for months before we resolved the issue one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the government's view, we wanted to get on with the job of the reform of Customs, not make ourself a hostage to the process of a joint resolution of the parliament. In fact, it might have been referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which could have held hearings to at least give Mr Kelly a chance to put his case. Maybe that is what honourable senators opposite would have wanted. Again, we would have had hours of hearings where Mr Kelly would have been attacked and abused on issues that may not have been particularly germane to what we were debating. I think that process, though it is available to the parliament, is deficient in the context of what we were trying to do in getting on with the job of changing Customs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other way of removing a statutory office holder, of course, as Senator Ferguson quite rightly mentioned, is to amend the legislation and abolish the position of comptroller-general. He mentioned the case of the amending and restructuring of the Industrial Relations Court some time ago. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Someone else mentioned it. If I remember correctly, it took months and months, if not a year, for that legislation to get through the parliament. Again, the government did not want to wait that long&mdash;if we wanted to use that process to remove Mr Kelly or any officer&mdash;to change the legislation. We all know how long the business list in the Senate is. Again, it may well have been referred to a committee. We have given a commitment, demanded by the opposition, that we will respond quickly and get on with the job of reforming Customs. So we are damned if we do and we are damned if we do not. I am not saying that to have a go at Senator Ferguson; I think he acknowledged that these were the other processes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances, with the Conroy review and its criticism available, I think the resignation of Mr Kelly from the position of comptroller-general was the best outcome. We also have acknowledged that he has a good track record in a number of areas. So, after discussions with him, the department and the Public Service Commissioner, we have offered him a role in which he maintains&mdash;for about the equivalent of the remaining period of his statutory office-holder's position, about two years&mdash;salary and conditions equivalent to those he would have earned as comptroller-general. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite describe the individual parts of the package, it is as though some parts of it are special for Mr Kelly. The package is what a departmental secretary is entitled to receive&mdash;nothing more, nothing less. There are many other secretaries of departments, all of whom receive the same package. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Ferguson has interjected about Mr Kelly's responsibility for Customs. The fact that he has resigned may be an indication that he has paid some penalty. That may be an interpretation the public wants to put on his resignation. The way he has been attacked in this place in particular over the past four or five weeks has been so consistent and vigorous and damning that his reputation clearly has been affected. That is a penalty he has paid. For a long time to come the way this matter has been raised and debated in this place will stand against his name. There can be no argument that his reputation has suffered from the way he has been individually attacked in this place. No case has been made to single out Mr Kelly in the way that this motion does and in the way that those opposite have done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson and Senator Watson spoke about this issue because of their involvement in the appropriate committees. The way some other senators opposite jumped on the bandwagon yesterday to speak in the debate indicated the permanent oppositionist mentality of some of those opposite. They realise that in the foreseeable future they will not be in government and they do not have to address issues of government. If they thought they may be in government in the next six months or at the next election, some wiser heads opposite would have said, `Do we want to set a precedent like this which a future opposition against us may have the numbers in the Senate to use to knock over a determination which we think is reasonable and which even the Public Service Commissioner has agreed to?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a warning sign for those opposite. They ought to think at times about what they would do and how they would act in government, not just how to be a permanent opposition. Nobody in the opposition&mdash;National Party or Liberal Party&mdash;has had any ministerial experience in government. That has  certainly been the case since the introduction of PR in the Senate. It is the first time in the history of the Senate that none of those opposite have had ministerial experience and it is showing somewhat in this debate. I am not referring to the speeches made by Senator Ferguson or Senator Watson. But some of the other speeches indicated to me the opposition's mentality. This approach will lead the opposition into a dead end and make it even more likely that the opposition will be rejected by the people in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My final comment about the process relates to where we are at with the Conroy review. I am very pleased&mdash;and Senator Ferguson would probably be pleased&mdash;to hear that over the last four or five weeks since the review was tabled I have had extensive consultations with Customs staff. My staff and Customs estimate that I have been to a number of meetings in all of the states. I have spoken to a total of around 2,000 members of Customs staff at meetings that have lasted for between an hour and an hour and a half. At those meetings Customs staff had every opportunity to raise individual issues and present individual recommendations to me and to express their view about the report. I have spoken to the union delegates committees in most states and that has been a very useful process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process is extremely important, not only because I hear their views but also because it encourages them to see that the process of change in Customs has to be, as much as anything, driven from the bottom up. I am encouraged by the response I have got from the average staff members. Many of them have accepted much of the criticism in the report. Some of them think they have been individually wrongly accused of things they have not done and they will argue that case in their submission. Many of the ordinary staff say that they never had anything to do with the Midford case and that they  should not be blamed for it. At the meetings there was clear criticism by the average staff member of middle and upper management of the organisation. But from those meetings and from over 400 individual and group responses&mdash;the consultation process&mdash;they are overwhelmingly in favour of the general thrust of reform, and that is a very encouraging start. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very pleased with that process and I hope that in the next few weeks, subject to the cabinet list and meetings of cabinet, preparation of the budget, and everything else, I can get a submission to cabinet on the major recommendations and I can make some announcements about where we go forward with Customs. I look forward with confidence to that in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whatever the government decided to do in respect of one public servant should not have been done in the way that it has been done. It used the Public Service determination, which then brought the matter into the parliament. As we all know, the parliament does have the right to disallow those determinations which, under normal circumstances, are there for particular classes of public servants. They are like an industrial award, if you like. As has been pointed out previously in the debate, it would be a most unusual situation for Public Service determinations to deal with a specific question such as this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two things concern me here: firstly, the responsibility of the parliament vis-a-vis the executive government; and, secondly, the responsibility of the executive government to manage the Public Service. I acknowledge what Senator Ferguson has said. He has made a very good case, not for what he is proposing but for what should happen in the future. He has obviously done his homework on this matter and he should be congratulated for that, but what concerns me is that, when we are faced with this situation, as we are now, what does the parliament do about it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said by the minister&mdash;and I think pointed out by Senator Ferguson previously&mdash;that, if the executive government considers that some action should be taken in respect of a public servant, and in this case a senior public servant, there are a number of remedies. Included in those remedies is resignation, a motion by both houses of parliament, and the amending of the legislation to abolish the position.

Presumably the government promised Mr Kelly that his talents would be able to be utilised in another area, and that that would not involve substantial loss of remuneration or entitlement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened with great interest to the words of my colleague Senator Harradine, and I think in his closing remarks he hit at the nub of his concerns. He said that he had some concerns as to whether it is the role of this parliament to unduly interfere in the processes of executive government. It has always been recognised that this parliament, and this chamber in particular, has a responsibility to oversee, scrutinise and sometimes bring into rein the processes of executive government. That is our foremost task. The question in this case is whether the step which is being embarked upon by this motion is an undue interference or whether, in the course of events, it is justified. That is the nub of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those who are fresh to this debate may not be fully aware of the history of Mr Kelly's involvement as Comptroller-General of Customs. I am sure there are many in this chamber who are not aware of the history of Customs over the last four years, other than with regard to the Midford Paramount case. I speak as a senator who spent three years overseeing the Customs Service when it appeared before Estimates Committee A. There were many manifest defects in the Customs Service. Midford Paramount was but one case in the sorry story of Customs. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. There have been many problems with Customs, and there have been many problems recently. The most noticeable, as far as I am concerned, are the manifest problems we had with the Coastwatch contract and the inability of Mr Kelly, when he was given good warning of my intention to question him on the Coastwatch contract, to answer even basic questions such as, `What was the financial situation of the contractor? Did the contractor have sufficient staff to meet its contractual obligations? Did Customs ever, in fact, ensure that the contractor had the sufficient staff?'. We could go into that in great detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a report which was very critical of Customs. Mr Kelly appears to have been persuaded&mdash;Senator Harradine quite rightly asked, `How was he persuaded?'&mdash;to hand in his resignation and he was then appointed as a special adviser on customs matters with the salary level and entitlements of a departmental secretary. That brings this matter to this chamber, because there was a special determination by the Public Service Commissioner to advance Mr Kelly to the level of a departmental secretary when he had previously been at the level of a deputy secretary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Kelly's defence, Senator Schacht said that there is absolutely no reason why those of us on this side or anybody in this chamber should overturn that Public Service Commissioner's determination because Mr Kelly has paid a sufficient price. In that statement alone Senator Schacht recognises that some responsibility attaches to Mr Kelly; otherwise he would not say that Mr Kelly has paid a sufficient price. But what a marvellous price it is when one is asked to bear some of the responsibility for the failures of the Customs Service and one then receives a pay rise. If only I could pay a price like that. This is the nub of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht made many comments. After listening to Senator Schacht last night, I thought the comments of Ralph Waldo Emerson, that men are always conservative after dinner and that radicals rarely have full stomachs, were highly relevant. Before he assumed his position as a minister on the treasury bench, Senator Schacht was the arch radical. He spent three years with me on the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, during which time he espoused every possible radical cause, and I do not begrudge him that right. We had many interesting debates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the arch radical has become the arch conservative. Senator Schacht was advancing a very interesting case last night. He said that it would be a dangerous precedent for this determination to be overturned. He said&mdash;and I do not think I am unfairly paraphrasing him&mdash;`It has never been done before and we shouldn't do it again'. The arch radical has turned into the arch conservative. But Senator Schacht knows full well that the process by which this determination is made is pursuant to a statute, and certain important observations need to be made with respect to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and foremost is that in previous times in other parliaments the appointment of people to high office was done by an act of parliament. The effect of the legislation, which sets up the office of the Public Service Commissioner, was to ensure that many of those matters were dealt with by a disallowable instrument, such as a determination. But it is surely not the intention of the statute that this parliament should abrogate its responsibility to oversee those matters; in fact, it is quite the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that this parliament requires the Public Service Commissioner to make a determination, which is a disallowable instrument, is not an abrogation of the power of this parliament; it is a reservation of the power of this parliament. It means that the parliament will give that responsibility to the Public Service Commissioner, but that this parliament reserves the right to say whether it does or does not agree with this or that determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an extraordinary argument for Senator Schacht to say, `Look, the Public Service Commissioner has made a determination; parliament should butt out'. If the intention of the act was that parliament should have no oversight and no say in these matters, then why would parliament require such determinations to be disallowable instruments? Parliament made that decision because it wished to reserve the right to oversee that process. So the arch radical turned arch conservative falls at the first hurdle because he does not understand the processes which he purports to be defending. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht then made another argument. In an attempt to persuade Senator Harradine to follow his side of the argument, Senator Schacht said that the parliament overturning a determination of the Public Service Commissioner would be like the parliament overturning a decision of a court or the Industrial Relations Tribunal in relation to an award. That is also a very flawed argument. I am sure Senator Harradine will appreciate the fact that the Public Service Commissioner is not a judicial officer, a court or a judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That argument is highly flawed. It is like saying that the parliament should not be allowed to oversee any actions of this individual. It is like saying that the actions of the Public Service Commissioner should be sacrosanct. In my role as Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I can assure this Senate that we have been highly active in scrutinising the determinations of the Public Service Commissioner. We have disallowed many determinations of the Public Service Commissioner for a whole range of reasons, yet Senator Schacht, through his argument, seems to be denying us any power at all. His argument is clearly flawed. In upholding the suggestions put forward by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, this Senate recognises the fact that there is a role to oversee the determinations of the Public Service Commissioner. The Public Service Commissioner is not sacrosanct. He is not above review and nor are his decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht then tried to take the argument one step further. He said, `Look, this is a disallowable instrument. The only ground that you have to disallow the determination is if it is improperly made'. He suggested that the Senate had the power to disallow the determination only if there were some defect in the process. That is not true. There is certainly a role for the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to disallow regulations that have a technical defect or where they breach one of the terms of reference to that committee. There is a general power for this Senate at any time, for whatever reason, to disallow a disallowable instrument; and that is a step we are taking. For Senator Schacht to say that there is no power or that the power is limited only to determinations which are improperly made or not made in the course of proper process is an absolute nonsense. So the arguments that Senator Schacht advances in this matter are extremely weak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In the case made by my colleague Senator Ferguson the question is: is it appropriate in these circumstances, in view of the manifest values of Customs over the past few years in which Mr Kelly has been comptroller-general, for him to be appointed to this position at this particular level of remuneration? The opposition, and other senators in this chamber, have formed the view that it is not. Not one argument has been advanced by the minister to say that what we are doing is improper. In fact, it is highly proper, because it seeks to ensure that parliament properly oversights the actions of executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the arch radical, having become a minister&mdash;now the arch conservative&mdash;is not so keen on the oversighting of executive government. It is entirely proper that this parliament sets standards and guidelines which should be followed. It is entirely proper, at a time when government is saying that it wants to make the terms and conditions of Public Service remuneration more like the terms and conditions in the private sector because it wants to attract the best talent, that we ensure that there are rewards for success and penalties for failure. That is the basis upon which Senator Ferguson has moved this motion of disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support my colleague Senator Ferguson entirely; he is correct. If the minister perhaps had not had so much to eat last night and was not such an arch conservative, and had considered the consequences of what was happening here, he too would recognise the fact that there is inherent merit in the motion which was moved by Senator Ferguson last night and which will be voted upon this morning. </PARA>

While he went some way to answering some of those questions, he raised a couple of issues that I do wish to comment on before the debate is closed. This morning the minister said that in the past four or five weeks opposition senators had personally attacked Mr Kelly. I make it quite clear that on no occasion have I or my colleagues personally attacked Mr Kelly. The attacks that have been made and the questions that have been asked have been in response to decisions that the minister or the government have taken.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the minister has been badly advised on this particular issue, and it does him no credit at all to suggest that a dangerous precedent will be set.

Apart from that, why would the parliament be given the power to disallow section 82D determinations if it was not intended that that power ever be used?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was obviously envisaged that there would be times that section 82D determinations would have to be disallowed, and that is why Labor government senators did it in 1987, 1988 and 1992. The only dangerous precedent that has been set is that the minister has chosen to reward Mr Kelly by paying him a salary package higher than he is legally entitled to. The minister also said that at the end of those discussions `Mr Kelly agreed that he should resign' from the position of comptroller-general. Yesterday the minister stated that the Conroy report did not find Mr Kelly personally responsible for the failings of the Australian Customs Service and did not find him guilty of any wrongdoing. If that is the case, why did Mr Kelly agree that he should resign? Surely, an agreement that he should resign is an admission of failure on his part to properly administer the service and to perform to the level expected of the comptroller-general. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill proposes an amendment to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. Details of the amendment are set out in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has been made necessary by the issue of Letters Patent to the Honourable Gordon Samuels AC QC and also to Mr Michael Codd AC to conduct an inquiry into the operation and management of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service. That Inquiry has been asked by the Government to report if possible by 30 September 1994 and in any case by 31 December 1994. As the terms of reference include the effectiveness and suitability of existing arrangements for control and accountability of ASIS and the resolution of grievances and complaints relating to ASIS, it is likely that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will have information and documents which would be of considerable relevance to the Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that provisions in the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act which were intended to give the maximum possible protection to information held by the Inspector-General may preclude the Inspector-General from providing information or documents to the Inquiry and therefore substantially impede the ability of the Inspector-General to co-operate with the Inquiry. Subsection 34(1) of the Act precludes the Inspector-General and his or her staff from disclosing or communicating to any person any information obtained by the reason of the person having held one of those positions except in the performance of duties and the exercise of powers under the Act. The Inspector-General's powers and functions are listed comprehensively in the Act and do not include the giving of evidence to Royal Commissions and similar inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this is that the Inspector-General may not lawfully disclose information or give documents to the Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill is intended to remove this difficulty. It will permit the current and former Inspector-General and the current and former staff of the Inspector-General to give information and evidence to the Commissions of Inquiry conducted by the Honourable Gordon Samuels and Mr Michael Codd without risking prosecution. In that way, it will ensure that the Commissions have access to a class of information which would be among the most relevant available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point should be emphasised that the amendment made by the Bill will not permit the disclosure of information or the giving of documents by the Inspector-General or staff other than to the specified Commissions of Inquiry just referred to. In that way, the present position, which emphasises the need to maintain the greatest possible protection for the privacy of individuals and for information about matters related to security, will be preserved as far as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the Bill is a measure of the importance which the Government attaches to enabling the Commissions of Inquiry to conduct the fullest examination of the matters within their Terms of Reference.</PARA>

<PARA>The need for this motion is self-evident. This is the sixth time that this matter has been debated in this place. The issue has been before the Senate since the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, made a statement on 22 September 1983. This matter has already occupied over eight hours of the Senate's time since the system was adopted by the House of Representatives. It was first proposed in 1987. Of that, 6 1/2 hours of debate has occurred during the life of this parliament. We debated it once in the autumn session last year, and we debated it twice in the budget session last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators would be aware, the government became extraordinarily frustrated with the progress that had been made on this particular issue. As a result, combined with a range of other senators representing minor parties and independents, the government voluntarily tabled pecuniary interest information in this chamber. I would suggest that the time proposed in this motion for this debate is a more than generous allocation, notwithstanding the fact that we have an extraordinary amount of time already involved in debate on this matter. Unfortunately, given the opposition's appalling record on this particular issue, it would be very irresponsible for the government not to take some precautions against further filibustering and time wasting on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government had, in the first instance, planned to list these motions for debate at the beginning of the budget sittings. But we have agreed&mdash;in response to strong requests from the Australian Democrats and Western Australian Greens, who do share with the government a view that these matters are of significance and are of great importance&mdash;to see these motions finalised in this chamber. We have agreed, appropriately, to bring this matter on for debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not my intention to prolong the debate on this particular motion, given that any time in excess of 30 minutes obviously will reduce the time for debate on the substantive motion. I believe that the time this motion proposes for debate on the substantive motion is a very generous amount of time indeed. I do not intend to prolong the debate at this stage. I do, obviously, wish at a later stage, assuming the carriage of this motion, to make a longer contribution on the substantive motion. I do commend this procedural motion to the Senate, and look forward to an early conclusion of this matter so debate on the substantive motion can commence yet again&mdash;but on this occasion conclude. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is really an appalling attempt by the government to gag debate in this chamber on an important matter. In my years here I do not recall any instance where before a debate the government has in fact sought to impose a limitation of time. Certainly, I can recall instances when it has sought during a debate to impose a guillotine, but this is a debate early in the session on an important matter coming on afresh. I cannot recall any instance where it has sought to pass a motion of this type.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly cannot recall any instance where the government has included a provision such as that included in paragraph 3 of this motion; that is, any time in excess of 30 minutes on this procedural debate will then be taken off the time for the substantive issue. If we follow through that logically it would mean that, if this debate went for some hours, the government would then expect the substantive motion to be passed without debate and we would not have the benefit of the long speech that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) has already forecast he would be giving on the substantive debate, which I think indicates just how shallow this attempt is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly appalling in the circumstances of the history of this matter. The minister said that it is self-evident that we should have such a restriction on debate because this issue has been around for some time. All that demonstrates is the failure in programming and planning by this government. The minister knows, and I can see the acknowledgment in the smile on his face, that for 11 years the government has from time to time introduced this motion into this place&mdash;I am talking about the substantive motion, not the procedural motion&mdash;and on no occasion did it pursue it to finality. On no occasion did it not proceed as a result of any filibuster on this side of the chamber. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am laughing at Senator Faulkner. In each instance, the government abandoned the project of its own accord and without action in this place. As the minister said, the government first brought down a statement in this chamber in 1983, under the name of Senator Button, saying that it intended to proceed with this matter. I remind honourable senators that it is the government's program and it has been the government's program every year since, every parliamentary session since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the government brought down a statement in the first instance, but basically did not pursue it. In 1986 the government remembered it again&mdash;it took it three years to recall what it had promised to do&mdash;and in 1986 the matter was brought in again. The government said that it was going to pursue it, but it kept postponing it. It was postponed for five days and then there was another motion to postpone it. There were something like five or six subsequent motions to postpone it before it was abandoned&mdash;in that instance for another year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the matter was brought up again. The government said that it would pursue it, but did not do so. In 1992, it was brought up again. We have been through various government ministers: we started with Senator Button&mdash;he had a go; Senator Gareth Evans had a go; then Senator Tate had a go, but he lost interest. In 1992, the government passed the matter over to Senator Cook. He started on it but he obviously was not interested and did not pursue it. It went back to Senator Button later in 1992. Then, in 1993, Senator Faulkner introduced it again and Senator Gareth Evans supported him on a subsequent day, but the government lost interest again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eleven years after the government first introduced this matter into the chamber, it has decided that it should be put on the front of the agenda again and that it should now be debated. The government says that it should not be debated in full; it should be debated pursuant to a time constraint to be imposed up front. As I said, this is unprecedented and an appalling abuse of the debating responsibility of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope that the minority parties would recognise that this is unacceptable to the Senate in terms of its traditions and functions because this is the chamber of debate. This is the chamber that can require accountability of government. We presume that the minority parties would say, `We won't have a bit of this, we will oppose it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate on senators' interests is a complex and important one and should be heard in full. We would hope, therefore, that that would be the position of the minority parties; however, we do not believe that it will be so. I regret to say that, although the minority parties continually reassure the Senate that the gag is not within their armoury, whenever the government says, `It's time', the Australian Democrats and the Greens jump. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have done it before, but I again remind the Australian Democrats of the advice a Democrat whip, former Senator McLean, gave to this chamber when, after an occasion on which the Democrats had agreed to the gag at the government's request, he said, and communicated in writing, `We will never allow the gag; we will not allow it because this is the chamber for debate'. He said that it would never occur again, yet every year when the government has gone to the Australian Democrats and said, `We want to constrain debate; we want to limit debate; we want to push something through', the Australian Democrats have said `okay'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Bourne that, with the Democrats' agreement, in 1984, 14 bills were allowed to go through as urgent; in 1987, 25 bills were allowed to go through as urgent; in 1988, 36 bills were allowed to go through as urgent&mdash;by `urgent' I mean constrained under the terms of debate&mdash;and in 1990, 52 bills were allowed to go through as urgent. In 1992, a further 57 bills went through under a guillotine imposed by the government with the support of the Australian Democrats. Yet the Australian Democrats come into this place and say, `We are here because we take on a responsibility to keep this government honest'. I say to Senator Bourne that the Democrats will not keep this government honest if they are prepared to constantly agree with the government to limit debate in the only real chamber of debate in the Australian parliament.</PARA>

Is it a demonstration of how this government intends to use its numbers, together with its friends in the Australian Democrats and the Greens, to further restrict debate on other matters? If this motion were carried, I think it would be a highly undesirable precedent for this chamber. I trust that when the minority parties join the debate on this motion they will recognise that and throw out the motion and say that in this chamber we will require full debate, not artificially restrained debate.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Hill that over the past few years it has been only by agreement that we have got through so much legislation at the end of the year. On many occasions in the last three years&mdash;in fact, for as long as I have been here&mdash;the Australian Democrats have not wanted to stay past the finishing time. When there was a motion to negate the adjournment, it was the opposition that agreed with the government, not the Australian Democrats. We have done this by agreement. `By agreement' is a very good thing, so I will not&mdash;yet again&mdash;hear this tirade from the opposition about this outrageous and appalling thing that happens; that when we want to get something finished we have a gag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a gag; this is a guillotine. It means that there will be a finalisation of this debate, which is something that the opposition does not want and has never wanted. It is going to come to a vote.

Their spouses can do it for themselves, and that will not be made public. The only reason for that is the Australian Democrats have got the government to agree to that amendment. I would hope that opposition senators would agree to that amendment, and I would expect them to agree with that amendment, because I heard Senator Hill on the radio this morning saying that he was concerned about that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no-one for the Democrats in the chamber for this debate. That is fairly typical of the way the Democrats go on.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about it, it is a gag, a restriction on free speech on a very important bill. Senator Bourne has indicated that she will be moving amendments about spouses not having to disclose their assets, on which the Democrats and the ALP have apparently done a deal&mdash;an exchange of buying. I suppose that is not a bad idea, but it shows that this whole proposal is absolutely stupid. It would be very easy for members of the Labor Party to move all of their assets, the piggery and everything else, into their spouse's name and, in that way, no-one in parliament would know anything about it. That shows the absolute stupidity of this proposal and the rules as they are before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one on our side of the parliament objects to a proper disclosure of assets if it is meaningful and proper. The way the rules are at the moment makes a mockery of this. I have had a look at some of the registers of interests. I notice Senator Schacht, the Minister for Science and Small Business, sitting opposite. He has indicated in his register that he has some interest in a public company, and then shows a company with `proprietary limited' after its name. For the minister responsible for small business not to understand the difference between a proprietary company and a public company is absolutely amazing. It simply shows that not even the small business minister can fill in his form properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can go through all of the Labor Party people. Where was the information about Mr Keating's piggery?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to embarrass Senator Denman, but two days ago I asked for a list of all senators' interests. I do not see Senator Denman's there. There is nothing wrong with that; I do not particularly care to see what she has got. But again it shows the stupidity of these rules and makes a mockery of them. Government members simply do not comply with them; they only comply with the rules when it suits them. They do not put in their spouses. I understand there is a rule about de facto spouses. I would like to know what the Labor Party and the minor parties mean by `de facto spouses'. Will they give us a definition of that. They have funny definitions of family relationships; just what does `de facto spouses' involve?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters have to be debated in full, and that is why this proposal needs full debate, not curtailed debate, not debate which is cut down to 2 1/2 hours or even less. It is absolutely abhorrent and appalling that whatever time over 30 minutes we take in this debate now on the guillotine comes off the substantive debate. The Democrats are wrong again when they say it is going to be a 2 1/2-hour debate; it could end up being a 10-minute debate. That is the sort of thing that the Democrats get sucked into every time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of very important issues have to be addressed when looking at the substantive motion. If we are going to get senators to declare their interests, when are we going to get political parties to declare their interests? When are we going to get a register to show what the ALP owns? For example, what shares does the ALP own in Queensland? Does it own shares in the casino that the Queensland Labor government is dealing with all the time? Does it own Centenary House which it leases to the audit office?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union people who control the ALP are some of the biggest landlords in Australia and yet the ALP makes rules in relation to that every day of the week and there is no disclosure. Senator Schacht and others are part of these unions; they have a very senior influence on the unions and, vice versa, the unions control this government. We all know that Mr Kelty sits at the cabinet table. Are their assets ever disclosed? Do we have a register of the interests of the ALP or the unions?  They should be disclosed, as should the shareholdings of the Labor Party. I know that the Queensland Labor Party has a huge share portfolio, but it is not disclosed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed a fairly sanctimonious editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> a couple of days ago that no doubt upset the Democrats; that is why they are getting all precious about it. </PARA>
<PARA>One might ask: are there some grounds, reason or need for asking the press and the media&mdash;the senior members of the press gallery, the proprietors of the major media outlets, the senior reporters and feature writers in the media&mdash;who have such an influence on the way this country is controlled and operated, to disclose their assets when they push a line or a particular party, usually the ALP, to get particular things done? These are matters which should be debated very fully, but with the help of the Democrats the government is going to curtail debate on these very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one would believe Senator Faulkner or anyone in the ALP, including its various spokesmen over the years, when they say that the opposition has filibustered on this particular issue. We have never filibustered on this issue. We have attempted to debate the issue fully and properly, but the government has never been bothered to bring the issue to a head. It is only doing it now, as it comes kicking and screaming, because it had to make some deal with the Democrats to keep Mrs Kelly and Senator Richardson out of another investigation on the sports rorts. So it had to give in on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will tell you why, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Labor Party has never been interested in pursuing this matter before; that is, because it does not want proper scrutiny of these rules and the register of interests. The ALP has deliberately tried to keep debate on this matter to an absolute minimum. It knows that it can push things through the lower house and nobody has the time to properly scrutinise things, but in the Senate, when we have the time to do so, we are able to debate things. We are able to look at the rules and see whether the ALP has ever complied with a proper disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's concern is that, if we debate this properly, we will be able to clearly show in the debate that the ALP continues to hide its assets and not to disclose properly. As I say, we have only to look at Mr Keating and the piggery to understand that these rules mean absolutely nothing. We have only to look at the ALP and the unions, which have enormous assets that are not disclosed, to realise that these rules mean absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate I am going to disclose my view on the matter. I do not care about disclosure. I will disclose honestly. Whenever we debate any legislation in which we have an interest or in which there is a possibility of a conflict of interest, the Liberal and National parties&mdash;I do not include the Democrats&mdash;disclose that interest. We tell honourable senators about it. We say, `We have an interest. Take what we say with that in mind'. That is the proper way to disclose and to register against any malpractice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party does not do that. It puts out these silly rules, which it does not comply with. Its members put in returns that do not show anything and, as I say, in the case of at least one senator, they do not even bother to put them in at all. That shows the absolute and complete futility of it. The Labor Party has always had it in its power to bring this matter up for debate if it wanted to. Senator Hill has pointed out the history of this matter. Since 1983 this matter keeps coming up. It is the Labor Party which will not proceed with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take offence at the editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> which says that we do not want to have a full disclosure. It is a sanctimonious article. It blames us and the Democrats but says nothing about the press gallery, the editors or the proprietors. It simply says that we have held it up. We have not held it up. It is the ALP which controls the business in this chamber. It could have brought this matter on at any time since 1983 and it has refused to do so. </PARA>

It is the Labor Party&mdash;I repeat&mdash;which has always had the ability to bring this matter before the chamber and it has refused to do so. The ALP does it now because it has almost run out of dollars to buy the Democrats with. The ALP has given them staff and other things and it has got to a stage where its currency has got a bit tainted. In a last, desperate attempt to keep Mrs Kelly and Senator Richardson out of an inquiry, here is the other deal: `Let us fool the Democrats'&mdash;which is pretty easy to do; and Senator Schacht and Senator Faulkner are past masters at putting it over the Democrats, but one does not have to be very clever to do that&mdash;</PARA>

It is a debate which should fully canvass whether the register of interests should not extend to heads of parliamentary departments in the Public Service; whether it should not extend to the ALP, the Liberal Party and the unions; and whether it should not extend to the press gallery.

The Auditor-General could not find a proper audit trail or proper documentation. That required the Senate to go back through the trail to find out whether or not political corruption occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we had a smoking gun; we had enormous evidence of political bias and political corruption. It required the Senate to go and find whether that corruption took place. On 3 March the Senate chose to turn a blind eye to potential political corruption. The Democrats, with Senator Harradine's support, voted with the government to ignore and turn a blind eye to potential political corruption, for two reasons: firstly, Mrs Kelly had resigned and, secondly, we came up with this hastily cobbled together package of accountability measures, which are welcome. However, the time limit issue becomes crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures included a commitment by Senator Evans that there would be timely responses to the Auditor-General's reports. That is not a measure. That is something that should take place as a matter of course. There should be timely responses to the Auditor-General's reports. That should not be a part of some new package; it should just be taken for granted. Another measure in the package was to ensure that the Auditor-General had proper resources. Again, that should not be part of a new package. That should be part of sensible parliamentary democracy with an independent Auditor-General. Where he senses that there needs to be an inquiry into malpractice, maladministration or bad financial management, he should have the independence and the resources to conduct an inquiry. It should certainly not be something, as Senator Evans said in his statement to the chamber on 3 March, that will be reviewed in the forward estimates and in allocating funding for the audit office for 1994-95 following the outcome of the inquiry into the Centenary House affair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no commitment on one of the most crucial parts of the accountability package&mdash;the resourcing and the independence of the Auditor-General. It is going to be reviewed in the estimates process later this year. What becomes urgent? Out of all of the commitments in the so-called accountability package that the Democrats and Senator Harradine so readily supported as a way of stopping a proper inquiry into potential political corruption, which are urgent? The urgent measure is to ensure that senators disclose and register their interests&mdash;very powerful stuff. Out of all of the accountability measures, who has to take the rap for potential political corruption in the sports rorts affair? <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures are not upgrading the Auditor-General immediately; they are not ensuring he is independent, that he has the resources or that report No. 296 of the Joint Committee on Public Accounts is implemented. This is just the bringing on of an urgent debate on the register of senators' interests. As Senator Hill has already said, that debate has occurred on a number of occasions. The government has been so non-committed to this issue. It has just used it as a political football; it has wheeled it out when it suits to turn up the heat on the opposition. That is not a very good way of conducting debate on government accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very sad thing is that this accountability package has occurred because the government had to buy off the Democrats and convince Senator Harradine that this was the  solution&mdash;not to have an inquiry, not to look into political corruption; just to ignore it, and to promise some of these measures down the track. Out of all these measures, the one that is considered urgent is to have senators register their interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the Australian Democrats that all of the other measures in the accountability package are the things that really matter. Senator Evans promised on 3 March that `if possible' within one month he will introduce redrafted legislation on the review of the Audit Act and will ensure that it is debated in both houses early in the spring session of 1994&mdash;not the budget session. A bill which was put up by Senator Watson is already on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. It is a very sensible piece of legislation which would make the Auditor-General a truly independent officer of the parliament. His resourcing would be a matter for us, not for the Department of Finance and Australian Labor Party ministers who despise the Auditor-General&mdash;or who have done for many months, until 3 March when they suddenly decided that the Auditor-General needed more money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told that we would see the legislation we have been promised within a month. We are already two weeks into that month and we have not seen it. We were told that it may not come into the parliament until the budget session and that it then may not be debated until the spring session of 1994. I can see us all here in the days before Christmas, on 20 December or something like that, with the poor old audit act amendment bill wallowing down the bottom of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>. The Democrats will have totally forgotten about it. It will just slip out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The register of senators' interests&mdash;this crucial part of the government's accountability package&mdash;is so urgent it has to be guillotined today. We even have to have a retrospective guillotine on the debate on the time limits on the guillotine. The amendments to the Audit Act will be put off until Christmas and they may still be awaiting debate in 1995; in fact, we may never see them again because they do not seem to be important to the government and the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no clear commitment that the Auditor-General will have the resources to do proper inquiries. All we are given is a vague reference to the fact that the government will review the Auditor-General's resources in the normal budgetary process. That is nothing new; of course, the Auditor-General's finances and appropriations are reviewed every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are having an inquiry, finally&mdash;with no help from the Australian Democrats, I might say&mdash;into the Centenary House affair. When this inquiry was originally raised by the Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, it was going to be a private inquiry that did not even report to the parliament. A firm commitment still has not been given in this place about the inquiry into the Centenary House affair, which I remind honourable senators involves a deal that the Australian Labor Party receive an over-market rent on a 15-year lease with a nine per cent increase every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the few pieces of paper coming out of the Auditor-General's office that the government reads on a monthly basis is the monthly rent cheque from the Auditor-General's office. The government does not like reading the Auditor-General's reports. It does not like reading the reports into the sports rorts affair. It does not like reading the reports into the abuse of the Australian government credit card. What government members, especially over there at Centenary House in the Labor Party offices, love reading is the rent cheque that comes from the Auditor-General every month. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government loves receiving it because every year it is a better story&mdash;it gets bigger by nine per cent. It is a lovely bit of paper. But unless it is reformed&mdash;and reformed urgently, because in September that rent is going up again by nine per cent; we will see that work through the budget process&mdash;every time that rent goes up by nine per cent, the resources of the Auditor-General go down by eight per cent. As we talk here today, there is only a one per cent increase in the Auditor-General's property operating expenses. What the Australian Labor Party likes reading from the Australian National Audit Office is the rent cheques; it does not like the reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that this matter is important and that the timeliness of these reform measures for the Auditor-General are crucial now is that only yesterday I incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a letter from the Auditor-General saying that he wants to do an inquiry into the allegations I have raised about uncommercial practices by Dasfleet. Dasfleet is engaged in tax evasion. It has cost the Australian taxpayer in the vicinity of $234,240 in the past 15 months in unpaid sales tax due to an administrative failure within Dasfleet and through a deal which supplies executive cars, like Ford Fairmonts, to the Transport Workers Union and government fuel cards which provide fuel at 59c a litre. These cars are supplied at a discount to the trade union movement of between $250,000 and $500,000 every year. The Auditor-General wants to look into it. In the letter that I incorporated into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> yesterday, the audit office said that it would like to conduct a full inquiry into my allegations; however, it is severely constrained by resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is urgent that the Auditor-General's resources be improved and that his independence be assured. But here we are, at the behest of the Australian Democrats, debating as a matter of extreme urgency the registry of senators' interests. This matter should involve a thorough debate on all of the issues. It goes to the heart of accountability in the democratic process and does deserve a debate. We have had a debate before, but, as Senator Harradine quite properly points out, there are new senators and new issues, including those resulting from the piggery affair and the sports rorts affair. Thankfully, the whole accountability issue is at the top of the political agenda again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what the Australian Democrats consider urgent. I wonder whether they consider it urgent for there to be a full inquiry into the potential political corruption of the operations and uncommercial dealings of Dasfleet. As it stands at the moment, the Auditor-General may not have the resources to undertake what is a sensible inquiry, something that the people need to understand. People do not like the Australian Labor Party government delivering benefits to its trade union mates&mdash;delivering them Ford Fairmonts and cheap petrol at 59c a litre. They do not like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 3 March the Senate refused to investigate potential political corruption. With the support of the Democrats and Senator Harradine, the Senate&mdash;shamefully, I suggest&mdash;turned its eyes away from the potential political corruption, the smoking gun in the sports rorts affair. That was a very sad day for the Senate and a very sad day for accountability, because the Auditor-General said that he did not have the resources to go back and try to uncover the audit trail which had been erased from the whiteboard. The Senate had the power and the capacity to go through the grants, talk to the people, investigate the local needs and find out whether there was political corruption. But the Senate said no. Mrs Kelly, as a minister&mdash;I think it was John Stone, the former head of Treasury, who described ministers as just part-players who flit across the political stage&mdash;just flitted across the political stage. </PARA>

She was not the issue. The issue of political bias and political corruption within government programs is the issue that lives with us. There are the accountability packages, including the package that Senator Gareth Evans put down on 3 March. The deal that was effectively cobbled out over a couple of meetings between Mr Beazley and Senator Kernot is part of the solution. But the timeliness of implementing that solution is crucial, and we are debating the time limits in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I am making in a roundabout and detailed way is that this accountability package, part of which is the register of senators' interests, includes some important measures. They are measures that should take place anyway, regardless of whether or not there is a Senate inquiry into the sports rorts affair. There should be a Senate inquiry into the sports rorts affair. It is a crucial issue of public accountability. All of the other measures that Senator Evans mentioned on 3 March, including the one we are debating today, are important, but they are ones which should take place anyway. They are not things which should be new initiatives of the government. The Auditor-General should be independent, and of course he should be properly resourced, regardless of the inquiry into the Centenary House affair, which is yet another inquiry into government mismanagement and political corruption. They are things that should be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are matters of importance that need to be considered whenever a guillotine is considered, and Senator Harradine of course has referred to those. Whenever senators' times and opportunities to speak are limited, we then impede the whole process of accountability of government. So I will not be supporting the guillotine, and I certainly will not be supporting paragraph (3) of the motion which involves a retrospective guillotine. It says that, for every minute I speak, I limit the time of some senator who in the future may want to contribute to the debate. So, with the nodding approval of my deputy whip, I will sit down and register my abhorrence of this new device called `a retrospective guillotine'. </PARA>

I notice that he took it so seriously that his is in handwriting that cannot be understood. If those opposite do not believe me, they can look for themselves. I will come back to that. As I said, when I spoke in this debate on 30 August 1993 I started by saying that I have no problems with declaring my interests to this chamber&mdash;it is there in my speech at the time&mdash;but I do have other problems. When it is mandatory, I will disclose my interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in disclosure as long as it is proper disclosure. Yet the exercise I have seen is totally inadequate. For example, what did the government's Mr Brereton have to say? He has a wife and, by the look of it, no dependent children, but nothing about his spouse was known to him&mdash;nothing!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sharing a house, a life and a bed with my wife, I have some knowledge of what she does, especially non-public activity, for example, directorships. If my wife were a director of a public company, I would know about it. But Mr Brereton has no such knowledge of his wife. So what is the use of disclosure if it is not proper disclosure? Can honourable senators tell me what is the use of it? It is a useless exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This exercise is only an excuse for the press to start digging in the hope of finding some conflict of interest. If the press had looked hard enough before they would have found Mr Keating's conflict of interest which Senator Baume has so ably talked about here. So I believe that, in its present form, disclosure is a nuisance and a totally unnecessary exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion says that the wife's register will not be open for public scrutiny. Looking at the present declaration of interests lodged, I do not know whether any declarations have been lodged by either the Greens or the Australian Democrats. Those interests may have been lodged, so I will not pass judgment on that. Whatever has to be declared by the spouses of those opposite has already been declared on the public record, so what is the point of having a register and not putting it on the public record?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the declaration of spouse interests. That should be coupled with dependent children. Earlier when I spoke, I said that children can leave dependence and return to dependence. That was the laughable situation with the other side&mdash;has no-one on the other side had a son or daughter who has left dependence after leaving university and then, having worked a couple of years, has gone back to university to do a higher degree? Who keeps that son or daughter? The government cannot keep that son or daughter all the time. So, the parents then take up responsibilities, as I have done. Then the son or daughter comes back to dependence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point&mdash;the son or daughter can come back to dependence. It could be argued that, if a spouse was dependent on my income, a reason could be found to have her declare her interests. However, I could see an argument where an independent spouse would not have to disclose interests. But disclosure should be done properly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I may have not read it properly, but nowhere in this motion are de facto relationships mentioned. Is there any mention of them? No-one is jumping up and down saying that they are included in it. The motion does not mention them. A lot of work has been done in the last 10 or 20 years to give de facto partners the same recognition as spouses, yet nothing about them is mentioned in the proposal. What about de facto relationships? Does a person have to declare such a relationship? Even the government advisers cannot find mention of them in the motion. What has been done about them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the reasons why, to date, I have opposed this proposal. These factors mean that there will not be proper disclosure.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">saving or investments accounts, indicating their nature and the name of the bank or other institutions concerned.</PARA>

My time is about to run out, unless the government grants me leave to continue my remarks for another 10 minutes. The motion also states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">being an officeholder of or financial contributor donating over $100 in any single calendar year to any organisation.</PARA>
<PARA>Does that mean that I have to name the church I belong to? I eventually want an answer to that question. For example, if I give more than $100 to the Church of England, I will have to declare it. If I give more than $100 to the Catholic church, I will have to declare it. Honourable senators opposite carry on about such matters when they are sworn in. Everyone to his own liking. That paragraph means that I virtually have to declare my religion. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think there is any need for me to repeat what the government put on record about this matter when it was debated in 1987, 1992 and again last year, as I mentioned in the earlier debate, in both the autumn and budget sittings. The key issue before the Senate again today is whether or not a declaration of pecuniary interests is a right and proper thing for Australian parliamentarians to do. That is the key issue. We on this side of the chamber believe it is the right thing; we always have. We have always been committed to that fundamental principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has said for a long time that the introduction of this system, which was adopted by the House of Representatives in 1986, is very long overdue for senators in this place.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, in fact. It is a very basic safeguard against conflict of interests. On this side of the chamber, we make no claim that the system as proposed is absolutely perfect. Any system that is adopted by any parliament has to attempt to reconcile the right to privacy of all citizens, whether they be members of parliament or not, with the basic right of electorates to information about their elected representatives. This proposed system attempts to strike, and I believe succeeds in striking, that balance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of parliament are required to declare the nature  of their pecuniary interests but not the precise extent of those interests. They are also required to declare the interests of their spouses and dependent children, but such declarations are to remain confidential unless the proposed committee on senators' interests determines that there is a conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might legitimately argue that the balance which the proposed system attempts to strike between these competing considerations errs on one side or the other. One cannot legitimately argue, as the opposition has tried to do in the past, that the system violates the right to privacy in requiring senators to declare, albeit confidentially, the pecuniary interests of their spouses and dependent children and, at the same time, panders to the right to privacy in requiring senators to declare their interests only in the broad rather than in precise financial terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has spoken at great length and made much of its support for the general principle of declaration of interests but cannot vote for or support the system that this government has proposed. It has trotted out a litany of alleged shortcomings in the proposed forms that are to be filled in and a litany of alleged inadequacies, suggesting that the definitions are imprecise or people may not be filling out the forms accurately. It is suggesting, of course, that the forms have these sorts of shortcomings&mdash;that they are ambiguous, unclear and so forth. This needs to be recognised as nothing more than an excuse by the opposition for doing nothing at all&mdash;which is its fundamental position of lack of principle on this issue.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be struggling, Senator McKiernan. That is a very unfair interjection. I point out to those on the other side of the chamber, who think they can design better forms for the declaration of pecuniary interests and a better system, that we will be providing, as an integral part of the system that we are putting forward, a very effective forum in which they can pursue that matter&mdash;the proposed committee of senators' interests, which will be debated after we have dealt with this substantive motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibilities of this committee will include consideration of any proposals made by senators and others as to the form and the content of the register. The committee will consider any submissions made in relation to the registering or declaring of interests. It will be able to consider what class of persons, if any, other than senators, ought to be required to register and declare their interests. The committee will also be able to make recommendations on those matters and any other matters that are relevant and brought before it in a proper way. So there is a mechanism to deal with this alleged inadequacy of the forms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key thing is that if a senator fills out a form such as the one that has been used voluntarily by government senators&mdash;as a result of the frustration we have all felt because the opposition is not fair dinkum on this issue, and never has been&mdash;that senator can be held accountable for what he or she does or does not declare on the form. That is the principle involved. That is the commitment that this government&mdash;in terms of every senator and every member of the House of Representatives&mdash;has shown. To be fair, so have the Australian Democrats and, I believe, the Western Australian Greens. I am not sure whether Senator Harradine made such a declaration or not. But other senators, independents and minor party senators in this chamber, have joined the government&mdash;out of a sense of frustration because of the desperate attempts by the opposition to stop this matter coming to a conclusion&mdash;and showed they were fair dinkum by voluntarily placing before the Australian people a declaration of their interests. </PARA>

It will be open to the opposition, it will be open to all parties represented on the committee, to put forward at any time suggestions to improve the system. I believe that is an appropriate way for the government to act and respond.

<TITLE>New South Wales Police Service: Taxation of Severance Pay</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to address an issue in relation to which I suppose I should declare a pecuniary interest on behalf of my late spouse. It involved a mistake by the New South Wales Police Service from 1978 to 1989 through which it overtaxed the long service leave component of those members of the force who left as a result of either voluntary retirement at age 60 or 65 or discharge on medical grounds. For those 11 years, the New South Wales Police Service overtaxed these members' long service payment on their retirement. Some of them have been overtaxed by around $1,000 or $1,500&mdash;not inconsequential amounts of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We first became aware of the matter when the Retired Police Association advised its members in 1990-91 that this had taken place and that they should contact the service to ask it to recalculate their severance pays and to calculate by how much they had been overtaxed. According to the police service, my husband has probably been overtaxed by something like $1,000. The Retired Police Association knows of in excess of 200 other members who have been overtaxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also appears from questions that have been asked in the state parliament that the New South Wales Police Service was not the only New South Wales government agency which did this. I am not sure which other New South Wales government agencies in fact did overtax their separating members, but certainly others have been involved. One of my colleagues in the other place spoke on this matter in the adjournment debate on 23 February. I commend that speech to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I became aware of the situation in 1990-91. The problem was very easy to fix for those people who had separated after 1 July 1986 because the three-year period of the statute of limitations for taxation was in force and they were able to seek recalculations and reassessments. The ones having problems are those who separated from the police force&mdash;and, obviously, from elsewhere in the New South Wales Public Service and associated organisations&mdash;at some time between 1978 and 1986. Those people have to attempt either to get an ex gratia payment from the state government&mdash;because it made the mistake&mdash;or to come back to the federal Department of Finance and ask it to make repayments for the overtaxing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue has dragged on since early 1991. There are now a number of estates held up because of the recalculations that have to be made and this overtaxing that needs to paid back. I personally do not know of any, but there must be estates that this has affected for something like three or four years. It must be extremely disappointing and traumatic for the families of those members to have this hanging over their heads. To lose one's spouse or a close family member is difficult enough, but to have this situation as a constant reminder of what has happened is intolerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of questions have been placed on notice in the New South Wales state parliament. On 3 March last year&mdash;it is at page 219 of the state <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;in answer to a question on notice, the police minister admitted that from August 1978 to July 1989 the New South Wales Police Service incorrectly calculated the tax payable on accumulated long service leave payments to employees on termination of services and that a number of other government departments and instrumentalities were also incorrectly calculating this particular tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He further went on to say that the New South Wales service was only one of a number of New South Wales government agencies at the time which misconstrued the taxation affecting termination lump sums. He was sympathetic to the claims by the affected employees of the police service. General issues of compensation for these individuals, and for the affected former members of any other government agency, is something that can be resolved only at government level through state Treasury. That was in March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a further answer to a question on notice on 11 November 1993. I think it is page 2406 from the state <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This one is from the Premier and the Minister of Economic Development:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will be announcing its decision regarding ex-gratia payments when it has considered all the issues relating to the matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That is fair enough. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of chief concern is whether it is possible to obtain compensation from the Commonwealth on behalf of the retired police. The delay is mainly caused by the length of time which has elapsed since the police service incorrectly interpreted and processed taxation on lump sum entitlements of retiring police. The mistake was made so long ago that it is difficult and time consuming to reconstruct events and recalculate the amounts which would be payable. These calculations must be made before a formal approach is made to the Commonwealth. The ministry of police and emergency services is actively investigating the matter and is retrieving records in order to establish who should be compensated and the amounts involved.</PARA>
<PARA>That raises a question with me: the 200-odd in the Retired Police Association know they are affected. What I think somebody should be asking the New South Wales government is just how many of their former employees are affected by this, because I think it could be a substantial number, but it may not be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question to the New South Wales government is: how is it going to advise these people of their rights, of the fact that they have been overtaxed, and how they should go about endeavouring to retrieve this overtaxed amount of money? To someone who is living on a pension, and be it living on a police pension, $1,000 is a huge amount of money. I will say more about the amounts of the police pension shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is a very important question. The New South Wales government and police department have to ask&mdash;because they are the ones with the primary files&mdash;just how many of their members have been overtaxed, and how they plan to contact those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now have a copy of a letter that Mr Hocking, the honorary state president of the Retired Police Association of New South Wales Inc. has received from the acting director of human resources of the New South Wales Police Service. This indicates that the service  has decided that morally the responsibility for repayment lies with the Commonwealth government, and that the best way of dealing with the issue might be for the state government to formally approach the Commonwealth government for assistance in resolving this matter. The letter further states that the Treasurer is at present considering how this might best be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was in February of this year. Again, state departments that have been involved are not moving particularly quickly. I would only urge them to speed up their work and to be cognisant that there are at least 220 that I personally know of who are affected, and there are a number of estates that are affected. Some of these estates could be of people who have died three or four years ago&mdash;or maybe even longer. I would think that if the widows, particularly of those police officers, are entitled to $1,000, they should be receiving $1,000, because the widow's component of the police pension is not particularly great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to another issue which I intend to pursue through several paths, and one of which I will be pursuing as a member of the superannuation committee. But I would bring to your notice today also the issue in relation to pensions to the spouses of deceased police officers, and that is, what I consider, the gross anomaly. Whilst it does not affect me financially&mdash;I obviously have an occupation where I am, I think, well remunerated&mdash;there would be a number of people out there, usually women, who, upon the death of their spouses, would want to know what finances are available to them, and would want those to be fixed up very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came to my attention that, to be eligible to obtain the widow's pension from the superannuation fund, one had to be married to the superannuant at the time of his separation from the New South Wales police force. In my case, my husband left the police force on 12 November 1982. We were married on 28 March 1987, so we were married for nearly seven years. I am informed that because we were not living together in a de facto relationship in 1982, or married&mdash;in fact, I publicly say we did not know one another then&mdash;I am ineligible for the widow's part of the pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether there are a great number of widows or widowers affected by this, but certainly a number of police officers are discharged for medical reasons from the police force at a reasonably early age. When they are medicalled out, the police force gets its pound of flesh off them first. They do not get medicalled out for trivial reasons; they are medicalled out for very good reasons. A lot of these people, if medicalled out when young, could well have re-married or married for the first time. They might well have been married for up to 10, 20, 30 or 40 years, but because they were not married or in a de facto relationship at the time of separation from the job, they would be ineligible for that part of the police pension that the widows are entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found out about this through a phone call I had from the State Superannuation Board. I was told quite abruptly, after I had been led to believe I was entitled to the pension by the police welfare&mdash;but police welfare may not have known the key dates so I am not critical of that body&mdash;that I was not eligible. I also had to inquire as to what date the superannuation entitlement payments ceased. They ceased from the date of death, so, given that most people would take at least a week for the wheels to turn to advise the superannuation board that an overpayment made has been made, most of the estates would be up for an overpayment. I casually asked this because I was not sure; I had assumed that it might have been like the Department of Social Security where there are a number of payments made at the old rate before they cut out to the single rate. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1X4">Senator WEST</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, there are six payments. But, no, this happens at the date of death. I got a lovely letter saying in the second paragraph that they were sorry my husband had died, but we had been made an overpayment of $297.75. That was not a particularly nice letter. I make the point that all the time this had been happening, people did not know what my professional capacity was. I had been doing this as Mrs Martin, not as Senator West.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I got this letter, I was, to say the least, not impressed. When I asked about it during the phone conversation, the comment was just briskly and brusquely made that I would have to talk to social security if I needed some money. I said that I did not need to talk to social security. It was a particularly horrible attitude. As I say, they had written to me to tell me that an overpayment had been made, and during the telephone conversation I asked for a written determination as to why I was ineligible for the widow's part of the superannuation and they sent me back this letter which did not address that at all. I then wrote to them again and requested a written determination on that&mdash;advising them, as they had requested, who the solicitor handling the estate was. I also requested a copy of the trust deeds for the superannuation fund of which my husband was a member. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received a written determination which was fairly scanty telling me it was in the terms of the `Police Regulations Superannuation Act 1906'. However, I have not received from them either a copy of that act or the trust deeds. This is an issue which I intend to discuss with the ISC because I am not quite sure where it is going to fit within the superannuation scheme of things. I would think that, as I had written as the widow of a superannuant member of the superannuation fund, I would be entitled to a copy of the trust deeds. If there are no trust deeds&mdash;and I do not know how that would come about&mdash;at least I should be entitled to a copy of the act and regulations which determine how these decisions and determinations are made. I have yet to take that up because this is a rather difficult business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I bring these things to the attention of honourable senators today and anyone who is listening out there because in difficult times one does not need to be treated like this. The treatment that I received as Mrs Martin was certainly a lot different to the treatment that I would normally have received as Senator West. As to the treatment that Mrs Martin got in a number of departments, whilst some have been absolutely wonderful, there have been others which have certainly been lacking in a lot of respect and understanding of the difficult times that families have to face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was angered recently when I listened to the attack by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) on the medical profession. I intended replying on their behalf, but I realised that his attack stemmed more from ignorance than from his knowledge. It was simplistic. While I was pondering this, I happened to read the latest news bulletin from the President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the beginning of October I decided that I should make `trust' the topic for my next Newsletter. A few days later, I was privileged to attend the Harveian Dinner of the Royal College of Physicians and to hear Professor Leslie Turnberg speak on this topic after dinner. His words so precisely and concisely expressed my own thoughts that I sought his permission to quote them.</PARA>
<PARA>I, in turn, wish to quote Professor Norman Browse, the President of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. He said that the President of the Royal College of Physicians of England said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to spend a moment talking about the nature of the relationship between doctor and patient, and the potential threats being posed to that interaction. It is a relationship which is critically dependent on trust, and extremely sensitive when that trust is replaced by suspicion. And there is no denying that there are tensions at the moment which may interrupt or inhibit that trust.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interaction between doctor and patient, a key element of any health system, has been changing over the last 20 to 30 years. The autonomy of patients has increased as their desire to become much more directly involved in their own care has developed. And acceptance by the patient of the doctor's opinion is less the norm now than it was, and our desire to do the best we can for our patients, acting simply in a benign form of paternalism, is clearly no longer sufficient or appropriate. But preserving the doctor's beneficence at a time when patients want to be involved to a much greater extent in decisions about their care, to choose their treatment, or even exercise their right to refuse treatment, is an adjustment we have to make. But, as we adjust, it is essential that we preserve the trust which contributes so much to the quality of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Patients consult doctors at a time of need when their morale is often at a low ebb. They are anxious and even desperate in their need to trust that their doctors will do their best for them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is now a danger that this relationship may be threatened. If patients suspect that their doctors may be weighing up the cost of what should be done for them against what may be done to treat other patients for the greater good of society, then that critical trust is eroded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all accept that resources can never keep up with demand and that the gap between what we do now and what we can afford is widening. The dilemma of having to choose how to use limited resources is not new, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">but the more doctors seem to be part of any process of rationing the less patients will trust them</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clear distinction to be drawn between the absolutely necessary process of setting priorities for health care and that involved in the provision of care by an individual doctor for an individual patient. This dilemma faces the Colleges as well as each doctor but, while we play our part in helping the politicians to tease out the priorities of health care need, neither the Colleges nor individual physicians wish to be seen to be part of a rationing process in which some treatments are denied because of lack of funds; <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">that is something which society has to decide through government and their representatives in management</EMPHASIS>. This poses a particular difficulty for those physicians who take on the dual role of clinician and manager and thus have to participate on behalf of the Health Service in decisions about the distribution of scarce resources. We must ensure that these roles are clearly distinguished and the two modes of behaviour&mdash;both important&mdash;are not confused. The implications of not doing so are bad for doctors and bad for patients.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current wave of adverse criticism of members of the medical profession in the press cannot be dissociated from this failing trust which, at least in part, comes from the uncertainty about what role doctors are playing in the Health Service. I do not believe we can ignore what the public and the press is saying.</PARA>
<PARA>Professor Browse went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I echo the words and sentiments of the PRCP which epitomise the concern of all the Colleges. As surgeons, we find ourselves in the front-line of the battle for the trust of our patients for, in addition to the problems of rationing and two-tier care, we have to endure television programmes claiming that surgeons perform operations for which they have not been trained, and which they have never performed before. How can we sustain the public's trust? We can and we should, because most of the TV and press statements are untrue or&mdash;worse&mdash;relate to a minute proportion of our colleagues and because most surgeons are wholly deserving of their patients' trust and support. Nevertheless, trust can only be maintained&mdash;or in some instances regained&mdash;by our individual dedication to our patients' welfare, by being open and honest, and by providing evidence that we are properly trained, and maintaining our knowledge and expertise by continuing our education throughout our professional life.</PARA>
<PARA>It is important that that be on the record because it might explain to the bureaucracy and to Senator Richardson the distinction that must be drawn between the medical profession as a whole and the health economists. The health economists and the bureaucracy are hell-bent on the rationing of resources. On the other hand, the individual medical practitioner has the responsibility to care for the particular patient before him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson does not appreciate that if his proposals go ahead he will destroy that essential trust that a patient should have in his or her doctor because the doctor then becomes the budget holder for the bureaucracy and government. Senator Richardson obviously does not understand. I tried to point out to him once that what he was proposing would destroy a relationship that had been present for over 2,000 years&mdash;when the principles of the Hippocratic oath were enunciated&mdash;that the responsibility of the doctor was to the patient and not to the budget provider. I thought it was essential I read this into the record so that if Senator Richardson does not read it, perhaps somebody in his department will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Australia, the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has introduced a system of continuing medical education and is about to introduce time-limited mandatory specialist registration. The Royal Australasian College of Surgeons is in the forefront in this regard. The Australian public can be assured that their trust in Australian surgery and Australian medicine is well placed and will continue to be well placed because the medical profession as a whole through its body, the Australian Medical Association, will be resisting whatever proposals are being presented by government&mdash;of whichever persuasion&mdash;which will come between that essential trust which must remain between a patient and his or her doctor. </PARA>

Item (f) commends the New South Wales government for its firefighting effort. How petty and mean-minded! I was not prepared to do that. I wanted that commendation to stand on the Senate record, and so I repeat it today. It was only because of the way in which the New South Wales government prepared for this, the structures that it had set up, the strength of its personnel and the excellence of its leadership that a greater disaster was averted. This should be on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a great shame that the ALP was not big enough to allow the full motion to be debated in this chamber so that people on this side of the Senate could have had the opportunity to speak.

We were very fortunate in being in a town that was on the coast.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always had a very healthy respect for bushfires, but I did not really appreciate their awesome power until the January fires in New South Wales, which were the worst fires ever. I had the opportunity as a senator to fly over them while I was doing other tasks. Looking down on these massive fire systems, I appreciated how incredibly difficult it was to do anything about them. The Royal National Park south of Sydney&mdash;the second oldest national park in the world&mdash;looked like a moonscape. There was not one vestige of green left. Ku-ring-gai Chase was a wall of flame on the evening we flew over it. The flames stretched from the Pacific Ocean right across to the Brooklyn bridge. In one direction it was headed for the Hawkesbury and, in the other direction, it was headed for the northern suburbs of Sydney. </PARA>

The essence of what it means to be an Australian stood in stark relief before him last January, silhouetted against the flames of the bushfire. Thousands of men and women dropped everything in early January&mdash;they left their jobs and their loved ones and risked their lives for others. It was in the same spirit of the pioneers who first came to this country, it was in the same spirit at the time of war, and it was in the same spirit at the times of hardship that have faced this country.

I raised these matters in the adjournment debate on the last day of the last sitting fortnight. I rose on that occasion because two nights previously Senator Schacht had challenged my speech and that of my friend and colleague Wilson Tuckey in the other place as being one of the worst sledgings or smearings that he had seen in 25 years. Senator Schacht must not have been listening in or may not have been around when his old backbench buddy former Senator Walsh was smearing the now Senator Noel Crichton-Browne before Senator Crichton-Browne had entered this place in 1980.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is beside the point. We are dealing with more important issues than that. The whole process of Senator Chris Evans coming into the chamber last night and speaking about my conduct during the previous sitting week needs to be put on the record. When I first spoke, Senator Schacht challenged me to substantiate my allegations. He said they were outrageous and that I was just throwing mud. I know that is not the case, but no-one else in this chamber knows that because the Australian Labor Party refuses to allow the documents to be tabled. Over the course of some sitting days, probably next week but possibly starting tomorrow, we will read those documents into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Either way, they will be put on the record. That will be a slow, tedious and painful process but it will take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important for Australian citizens to know&mdash;even more so now that Dr Lawrence has convincingly won the by-election and will be in the Keating cabinet within a few days&mdash;that Dr Lawrence's standing in the community, having been a former premier and having been a so-called defender of parliamentary standards and standards in personal behaviour, will be scrutinised as to her own behaviour. She entered the Western Australian parliament and put herself up as someone who would try to take the nasty heat out of politics in the Legislative Assembly and would not engage in crass, nasty, dirty politics. She has very successfully ensured that that is her image. If she behaves in her own affairs in the way that she says she behaves, that is to be commended and I will be the first one to commend her. But it is quite appropriate for people to make their own judgments about Dr Lawrence's behaviour based on the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last sitting Thursday, I decided to take up Senator Schacht's challenge and put on the record in the most unemotional and non-political way as is possible in these things the facts surrounding this matter. I carefully went through a whole wad of correspondence, documents and articles that would support my allegations and would allow others to look through those documents and find out whether I was indeed throwing mud or whether I was basing my analysis on a series of documents that showed quite conclusively one way or the other that Dr Lawrence had specific knowledge of the contents of the petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I approached Senator Gareth Evans, who was the minister at the table at the time, and said, `Here is a series of documents that I will seek to table in the adjournment debate'. Senator Evans flipped through them flippantly and said, `Yep, no worries'. I suggested to Senator Evans&mdash;and this is revealing a private conversation which I am sure Senator Evans would not mind&mdash;that as a matter of courtesy, sense and fair play he refer these documents to Senator McKiernan because Senator McKiernan has an interest in and knowledge of this. I told him that I would be happy to allow him to go through these documents with Senator McKiernan and that I would review my position if Senator McKiernan did not want any of the documents tabled. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had spoken to Senator McKiernan, as he will probably attest when he responds, on a number of occasions during that day regarding what I was going to do. We had various discussions about the contents of some of the letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe I behaved in an extremely fair manner when it came to the discussion of those documents and the tabling of those documents. The fairness that I displayed during that day was not returned that night because not only was I not allowed to table the documents to allow people to make a fair assessment of the facts but also I was not even allowed to list the documents or read into the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the documents that I sought to table. In fact, Senator Faulkner said, `I do not care what documents they are; you are not getting leave'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a number of occasions I asked the President for permission to summarise the documents that I wanted to table so people could see the nature of the very documents. The government did not even want that known. That shows again a very severe double standard. As I said, we will ensure one way or another, sooner or later, that these documents are before the Senate, even if that takes up an enormous amount of time of the adjournment and matters of public interest debates over the coming weeks to read page by page, paragraph by paragraph, those letters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Chris Evans from Western Australia decided to keep this matter on the boil and, I guess, to rub our noses in the loss in Fremantle by coming in here and referring to the comments of our federal secretary, Andrew Robb, that the campaign in the House of Representatives and the Senate was not an orchestrated one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I found out through a third-hand source that Senator Chris Evans was going to come into this chamber to raise these matters again. On every occasion that I have raised these sorts of contentious issues&mdash;and I am sure there have been some from time to time over the last 3 1/2 years that I have been in this place&mdash;I have always gone to my counterpart, whoever had the interest in the same debate and was to be my sparring partner, and said that I intended to do something of that type. I did that, as Senator McKiernan will attest, on the last sitting Thursday. I told Senator Evans, again, early this morning that I intended today to respond to his remarks last night. But yesterday Senator Chris Evans chose not to so inform me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that Senator Evans, as he has been here for only a relatively short time, does not know that it is a fundamental courtesy to do that: when one intends to come into this place and raise controversial political issues, particularly that relate to individuals&mdash;and in this case he referred to me by name&mdash;notice should be given, even if it is only a few minutes notice. Then at least I would have been here to respond, I would not have been surprised by seeing Senator Evans's contribution on the monitor and would not have had to rush into the chamber unprepared. But Senator Chris Evans chose to do as he did. Having got to know Senator Chris Evans from sitting on aeroplanes with him from week to week, I respect him as an honourable and decent human being, and I will give him the benefit of the doubt. I hope that he will not do it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point of the speech made last night by Senator Chris Evans was to imply that Andrew Robb had misled the Australian public, particularly in relation to the comments I had made here in the Senate. I did not discuss with Andrew Robb anything I had done or said in the Senate. In fact, I know very well, from discussions about the Fremantle by-election, that it was very much Andrew Robb's opinion that personal attacks on Dr Lawrence would not assist our campaign. To that extent, I probably contravened our federal secretary's specific political instructions earlier in the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I thought that it was important, having been challenged by Senator Schacht, that I should at least put the efficacy and details of my allegations right on that Thursday night. Of course I was thwarted in that, firstly, by the Labor Party's spurious points of order, which I have now referred to the President for further ruling and consideration and, secondly, by its refusal to allow me to table what I think are important documents which will reveal the facts and information which will allow Australian citizens, members of parliament and senators to come to their own conclusions as to whether or not Dr Lawrence was aware and was a party to the political tactic to table Brian Easton's petition of last resort in the Legislative Assembly late in 1992. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me just take up the point made by Senator Panizza and Senator Campbell. Last week I received a letter from the mother of Penny Easton, the person who died in very tragic circumstances. The mother wrote to me about the comments I had made in the chamber last week. She did not have the accurate comments that I had made. I have corrected that by sending her an extract from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I suggested to Mrs Campbell that, if she wants to pursue this matter further, the place to do it is in the Western Australian parliament; in the Legislative Council, more particularly, where the incident first was raised with the petition of last resort, or in the Legislative Assembly. If Mrs Campbell wants a parliamentary or judicial inquiry, that is where the matter should be raised, not here in the federal parliament. The petition of last resort which has been mentioned was presented to the upper house, the Legislative Council, of Western Australia&mdash;not to the Senate and not to the House of Representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my response to the letter that Mrs Campbell sent me, I made a point which I think is a very important one; in Western Australia there is now a Liberal government administration. I suggested that, if there were political games being played at the time of Penny Easton's death and if those political games had any impact or any causal connection with the death, there might be a better chance of getting such a judicial or parliamentary inquiry established in Western Australia now that there is a Liberal Party administration in that state. I think that is where it should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people want to continue to pursue this matter, I think the quite proper place to do that is in the respective legislature in Western Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points of order that I raised was that the matter of the petition of last resort had already been investigated by the privileges committee of the Legislative Council of Western Australia. That privileges committee brought down its report and exonerated Mr Halden, the person who tabled the petition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the non-controversial matter of tobacco. Although it is non-controversial, it is certainly providing a lot of problems for growers in North Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria. The tobacco industry is a vital source of employment and income to parts of northern Australia and is the mainstay of the area around Mareeba and Dimbulah.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tobacco industry was one of the industries that opened up North Queensland. The government started the tobacco industry as an import replacement industry. People were encouraged to come to the area and take up selections to grow tobacco in the 1930s and 1940s. The Tinaroo dam and canal systems were built to sustain the industry. Out of all this government encouragement, a vital industry developed. The area prospered, the north was developed, and the industry became the mainstay for a diverse, cosmopolitan region as many European migrants were attracted to the area&mdash;Albanians, Greeks and many others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, for the last 10 years the industry has been in decline. It has rationalised itself, with over half the growers in North Queensland leaving the industry. The tobacco industry in recent years has also suffered the vagaries of decreasing production through health campaigns and massive government taxes. Both state and federal governments have used tobacco as a giant revenue source. Just last year, the Commonwealth collected excise of $4 billion, and Queensland had an extra $18 million windfall. Taxes are significant in that not only do they reduce consumption, which is falling at six per cent a year, but also governments directly gain extra revenue to fund worthwhile community programs such as increased education and health facilities. A breakdown of the tax from an average pack of cigarettes gives $1.22 to the federal government, $1.70 to the state government, $1.01 to the manufacturer, 80c to the retailer, and 0.06 of a cent to the grower. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to address the issue of the tobacco industry today not from the health issue&mdash;an important but entirely different issue&mdash;but from the angle of the tobacco industry as a primary industry that has become established and sustained rural communities for the last 70 years. The tobacco industry presently operates under the tobacco industry stabilisation scheme which is due to end in September 1995. Under the scheme, growers' quotas are set. These quotas have declined way below the industry's capacity to produce 16 million tonnes. Just over the last two years, growers' quotas have been reduced by 42 per cent to 8.1 million kilograms and are expected to continue to decline next season. The industry presently operates under a mixing regulation supported by the three cigarette manufacturers as well as the growers whereby local tobacco forms 57 per cent of the tobacco used by manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the industry has just been dealt a further blow with the high quota levels submitted by the government under our schedule to the GATT Uruguay Round resolution. The government has submitted a tariff quota level for tobacco entering Australia at a concessional rate of 11.184 million kilograms or 70 to 80 per cent of local consumption. Both the manufacturers and the growers have said that this figure is too high and have said so to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT process was meant to convert the local content provision which stands at 50 per cent to a tariff rate. But the effect of it being based on the 1986 to 1988 levels and not the more recent years, which more accurately reflects declining consumption, means that Australian growers will have 70 per cent or more of their market open to imports. This is a most unfair consequence of the GATT solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry was assured by Minister Kerin when negotiations first started that it had nothing to fear, that it would not be left in a worse position. There is an Industry Commission inquiry presently under way, to be followed by a task force, but the damage has already been done to the industry by the high tariff quota level agreed by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is predicted that by the year 1996, when the full effect of the tariff quota is being felt, Australian producers will be reduced to contributing three million kilograms, a small quantity even when compared to the much reduced 8.1 million kilograms this season. That will be a reduction of around 70 to 80 per cent of the previous quota and will result in a reduction of their income of the same proportion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that the Australian tobacco industry is an inefficient industry. The recently released Tobacco Research and Development Council report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prices achieved are the only guide available to portray the movement in crop quality and it is pleasing to see the upward trend.</PARA>
<PARA>It is also reported that, as production decreases, so does research and development funding, just when it is most needed. </PARA>
<PARA>The industry realises that half the growers will have to exit for the other half to survive. They need help to restructure and they need time to convert to other crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Queensland it is not simply a matter of switching to rice or sugar, as the soil requirements are quite different, but there may be other crops that, once researched, can be used as replacement industries for some of these growers. Most importantly, towns such as Mareeba and Dimbulah, that have been legitimately based on the tobacco industry, cannot be allowed to suffer and die. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year the tobacco industry contributed $50 million to the Mareeba area. Mareeba has already taken the full brunt of the wet tropics declaration, resulting in the closure of its timber industry and the loss of hundreds of jobs. It has not benefited from the growth of tourism in the coastal area. It is a town hanging on the revival of the tobacco industry and the introduction of new replacement primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Towns such as Mareeba and Dimbulah are solid towns supporting the region. They provide good private sector services, essential medical services and financial services. Their continued healthy survival is essential for the far-flung beef industry and the people and industries of the far north and north-west of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must take some responsibility for the situation now faced by the towns which support the tobacco industry. Tobacco growers are hardworking farmers growing a legal crop in a mechanised and advanced way. Each tobacco farm is a high level employer, employing around eight workers at harvest time. The industry is a valuable contributor to the economic health of the entire nation, as well as the areas where tobacco is grown. The industry is now facing a crisis. Although normal market changes are having their effect, it is the extremely high import tariff quota of 11.184 million kilograms that has been set that is hanging like a death threat over the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian growers have to compete against highly supported industries overseas. Japanese growers are guaranteed $17 a kilogram when our growers receive $6.03 a kilogram. Major exporters such as Zimbabwe and Malawi benefit from massive devaluations of their currencies, and the US in the lead-up to the Uruguay Round resolution imposed a 75 per cent local content rule on its tobacco industry as a massive support scheme for its tobacco growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian tobacco growers find themselves in a serious position&mdash;one caused by factors beyond their control. Serious consideration must be given to government funding to restructure the industry. It is most important that this be done over a sufficient period of time so that new agricultural industries can prove their sustainability and viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While hoping the Industry Commission and task force will bring some sought after solutions to the industry, it seems that any tariffication is still stuck with the high 70 per cent to 80 per cent tariff import quota level that the industry must now wear. Growers have been left in a seriously damaged financial position as a consequence of the GATT Uruguay Round. Consequently, the government must take a special interest in the future of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A smaller domestic industry can survive. However, around 50 per cent of the industry must leave. This restructuring must be done in stages, giving the industry and towns time to adjust. They cannot restructure all at the one time. Government funds must be provided for buyouts at the appropriate times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with some other rural industries, tobacco has been badly hurt by the much higher levels of the 1986-88 quotas being used. Tobacco is only a small industry and gains for other rural industries from the Uruguay Round do not provide much comfort when it is their industry that is bearing a very unfair burden of production cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is to be subject to the loss of its mixing regulations next year. I put it to the government that before this happens the tobacco industry must have in place a restructuring program that allows the industry to survive in a viable form and that allows growers who must leave the industry a future in other rural industries that have been tried and proven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future of the tobacco industry is certainly a case where the government must take responsibility for the state it now finds itself in. I look forward to the government accepting its responsibility in a constructive way. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the Treasurer is at this very minute giving a press conference on the national account figures. The national accounts for the December quarter were released at 11.30 a.m. today. They show that the economy grew by 1.7 per cent in real terms, seasonally adjusted, for the December quarter. That is the highest quarterly result in five years in this economy. They also show that activity increased by 4 per cent in the course of last year. This growth is controlled and appears to be occurring without any inflationary pressures. It is unambiguously good news for Australia and the economy. It shows that the economy is on track with low inflation and low interest rates and that the growth is being taken up by the private sector. These figures demonstrate private sector growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the normal practice, the release of the national accounts will provide a trigger for the review of the government's economic forecast for the current year and for the 1994-95 year as part of the preparation for this coming budget. It is safe to say that today's figures are likely to lead to a further upwards notch in the expected growth figure for 1993-94 from the revised figure of 3 1/2 per cent announced by the Treasurer in early February. Indeed, the December quarter result confirms that underlying growth is now running at around four per cent, as indicated by the Treasurer at that time. However, it provides no credence for those who, for whatever purpose, have recently been stirring up concerns about the economy overheating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The composition of the growth revealed by these figures is further confirmation of the shift in activity to the private sector. Private sector consumption and stock building were by far the largest two contributors to growth in the December quarter&mdash;contributions of 1.1 percentage points and 0.7 percentage points respectively to the expenditure measure of GDP. Net exports contributed a further 0.4 percentage points&mdash;evidence of the significant structural improvement which has been achieved in Australia's external accounts. In contrast, public sector consumption was merely 0.2 percentage points.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business investment was neutral in terms of growth in the December quarter. Nevertheless, the strong build-up in private non-farm stocks is evidence of the continuing improvement in business confidence and a further reflection of the strong fundamentals, which point to an increase in investment for the future. Those fundamentals are historically low inflation, historically high company profits, strengthening consumer confidence and the evidence of increasing capacity utilisation in the economy. These growth figures are impressive. They surpass our major trading partners as a group. If I were to characterise them, I would do so by saying that the wind is in our sails, we are on a calm sea, we are on a broad reach, we are reaching well and we are on course.</PARA>

If he had read the answer, which he obviously has not done, he could not possibly say that. It includes things like saying that $2 million is for casemix developments which would have occurred in any event.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are many different kinds of Senate committee hearings and inquiries and in some of them it has to be expected that partisan political considerations will prevail and the committee will not meet judicial or even quasi-judicial standards. When a Senate committee is looking at the question of propriety or impropriety, when it is passing judgment on the conduct of individuals, when it is passing judgment on business decisions that affect the credibility and the viability of particular companies, then it is absolutely crucial that the highest standards of propriety be adhered to by the committee and by all those associated with it. That is why the revelations about the actions of Senator Alston are so serious and why the government believes he should step down as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the Print Media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have here a situation in which the inquiry, of which Senator Alston is chairman, is determining three central questions: whether there were conditions attached to the approval of an increase in foreign ownership to the effect that Fairfax coverage had to be balanced; if so, did Fairfax act on the basis of any such arrangement; and, if so again, what was the propriety of such conduct or arrangement. Against that background, we now have revelations of Senator Alston ringing a Fairfax editor on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition complaining of bias and demanding balanced coverage, and doing so at a time when he was exercising real power in determining the outcome of an inquiry that was crucial to Fairfax's commercial reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, whatever Senator Alston's intentions may have been when making that particular phone call, it has all the appearances of a trade-off situation&mdash;`If you want a reasonable outcome from this inquiry which I am running, then you had better give us the kind of coverage we want'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Need I remind the Senate that the last time we had legislation before us to introduce a bill of rights into this country, we got to about clause 4 after 38 hours of debate&mdash;and I say to the Australian Democrats that they aided and abetted in this delaying of that legislation. Four clauses in 38 hours in pursuing legislation to introduce a bill of rights is something that this place can never be proud of. That delay at the time was recognised by most commentators as being fatal to that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises the importance of a bill of rights and its importance in providing a means for protecting and advancing the human rights of individuals. We have had an ongoing commitment to ensure that all Australians exercise and enjoy their human rights, and that the interests of individuals and minorities are not sacrificed at the will of the majority. If one looks at our record, since coming to office some 10 years or so ago the government has established national human rights machinery to assist in the domestic protection of human rights. We have outlawed race discrimination, sex discrimination, sexual harassment, and disability discrimination. We have established the Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission. We have ensured the right to privacy and we have created the office of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. All those initiatives are quite important and fundamental in the protection of human rights in this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But apart from that domestic agenda that we have implemented&mdash;apart from the domestic machinery we have put in place&mdash;we have also, in the last few years, allowed individuals who feel that their human rights have been violated, and who have exhausted domestic remedies, to complain to the relevant international bodies under various international treaties, such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights, the race discrimination convention, and the torture convention. These complaint mechanisms available now to Australian citizens allow our domestic law to be scrutinised and measured against international standards.</PARA>

They stood by and allowed that process to continue, knowing full well that the end result of that delay, that filibustering, would be the failure of that bill of rights.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No site-specific environmental issues arose out of the assessment process. The new site is not expected to give rise to new environmental issues or different impacts. Impacts of the facility and associated dredging on seagrass beds and prawn fisheries were examined as part of the EIS process, and the Northern Territory government made recommendations for further studies in regard to these impacts. I am advised that these studies are addressed in the draft dredging environmental management plan. The EMP provides for the monitoring and management of impacts. For example, impacts on seagrass beds will be managed as part of that monitoring process. I understand that the changes to the design of the facility were in response to a recommendation by the Northern Territory government that the length of the causeway originally proposed be minimised. This causeway has now been eliminated to reduce impacts on longshore drift.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the 20 of 36 recommendations, that is a matter for the Northern Territory government. They are its recommendations. However, I am advised that the Northern Territory government considers that the recommendations are being appropriately addressed.

Many of the Northern Territory recommendations are ongoing for the life of the project or only relevant at later stages of development.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ongoing environmental impacts will be managed through the EMPs required for the project.

It is at an estimated cost of $40 million in a full year. It means that there is an increased incentive and reward for unemployed people to look for and take up part-time or casual work without the same threat against their pension, particularly if they have this credit amassed. It is also going to be particularly useful for people who at the moment find that it is very hard to get full-time work but who are able to benefit from part-time and, particularly, casual or seasonal work.</PARA></TALK.START>

Once people leave the unemployed payment system, their accumulated credit will be preserved for up to 13 weeks, so the earnings credit will also be of benefit to those people who come on and off unemployment benefits looking for and enjoying sometimes the benefits of casual or seasonal work. The earnings credit very much assists people on unemployment benefits. It recognises that they are much better assisted towards returning to full-time work if they are able to have access to part-time or casual work.

In the case of the US, for example, that will mean a reduction in value of subsidies on wheat and flour exports from $US846 million to $US364 million and a very significant reduction in volume from 21.4 million tonnes to 14.5 million tonnes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid raised an issue with me last night about a possible defraud of the Customs Service. She suggested a figure of around $1 million. I undertook to provide an answer today. I am somewhat disappointed to see that the issue has been raised at all at this point, because the attendant media exposure could actually jeopardise an ongoing police investigation. Therefore, my answer today will be limited to some essential facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week, customs identified in the computer system a number of payments which aroused suspicion of internal fraud. The figure is over $1 million. The matter was passed to the Australian Federal Police on 9 March. The person involved has surrendered his passport to the police, who are continuing their inquiries. No charges have been laid as yet. The person is not a customs officer. He is engaged by a private firm contracted to customs. The matter is in the hands of the police. I think it would be best at this stage to accept that we will wait till we get further information of developments in this matter. I say to Senator Reid and the Senate that I will provide further appropriate information to the Senate as it becomes available in this matter. </PARA>

So that, I am assured, will be very soon in coming. The answer to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy question, which is question No. 1023, is now only awaiting input from the Department of Administrative Services.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr this day, relating to the Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in relation to the Print Media.</PARA>
<PARA>The history of this inquiry is essentially a farrago of appalling misjudgments. The very fact that the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media was established under the terms of reference that it was, suggested to me that there was a distinct possibility the committee would turn into a farce. When we look at a Senate committee which essentially is examining the propriety or impropriety of, and passing judgments on, the conduct of individuals or business decisions that affect the credibility and viability of particular companies, it is absolutely crucial that the operations of that committee are seen to be aboveboard. However, that has not been the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the beginning of the operations of this committee on 9 March 1994 we were told there would be no witch-hunt. Assurances were given, both by the opposition and the Australian Democrats, that there would not be a witch-hunt and that issues of great substance would be considered. However, the establishment of this committee has demonstrated that to have been an act of misjudgment. The second act, I suppose, was the proposition that the chair be given to Senator Alston, a member of the opposition, which clearly has a political agenda to pursue, as evidenced by the way in which the matters have been under investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has demonstrated to us that it has been operating double standards. We have complained on many occasions about the way in which this committee has operated. We have indicated that we are not entirely happy with the breach of the conventions in the way in which these sorts of committees should operate. We have seen the threatening of public servants and, I believe, attempts to intimidate public servants and acts of misjudgment. We have also been given in recent times an indication by Senator Alston that he has the capacity to ring the editor of a newspaper, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, which is under investigation by this committee, and complain about that newspaper's editorial balance. We have been given the reference to look into that paper's content and the way in which it is operated. That act has been described as dumb. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In politics, one should not necessarily suggest that stupidity in itself is a reason for resignation. We know that if that were the case quite a few people in public life would have some difficulty. However, we do have a real problem with the intentions of Senator Alston. Whatever he claims were his intentions, his actions have given the committee the appearance of having been fundamentally compromised. We have a situation where the chairman of the committee at this time has more power at his disposal than he is ever likely to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report to be brought down will comment upon the operations of John Fairfax Ltd and the actions of individuals with respect to their propriety. That raises some pretty basic questions about the way in which the committee should operate. When it is said that there should be some discussion and that questions of judgment should be exercised with respect to the transfer of ownership of Fairfax, it is important and absolutely fundamental that there is no hypocrisy from the chairman. There should also be no question of double standards. In this case, the chairman of this committee has indicated on the public record that he believes that these matters are clear and that a deal was done. He has prejudged the operations of the committee. We have seen the final act of misjudgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I put to Senator Evans today was based on my concern for the integrity of our committee. It really does raise the issue of how long this committee can continue. Quite clearly, it is in the interests of the operations of this committee&mdash;if it wants any integrity at all in the report&mdash;that Senator Alston stand down from the chair. I believe that there are very fundamental issues here that go to the question of propriety and the issue of hypocrisy. Acting on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), the chairman of this committee, at a time when he has more power than he is ever likely to have, is able to raise matters with editors about the question of balance, the very subject we are purporting to inquire into. It is quite clear, as far as I am concerned, that Senator Alston should stand down. Under the terms of reference that have been put through this Senate, another coalition member can take the chair. If there is to be any propriety or integrity in the way in which this committee operates, Senator Alston should stand down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to take particular note of the answer given by Senator Gareth Evans. I thought it was highly significant in a number of respects; in fact, it was quite measured. In some ways, I do not think he had his heart in it. For example, he did not seek to comment on the suggestion of a deal which, in the last day or so, has been elevated in yet another desperate attempt to suggest that somehow the Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media is not behaving in the way that it should. On 18 November last year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), when in Seattle, in talking about Conrad Black, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, we'll think about it, but we want a commitment from you that the paper will be balanced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So therefore, after the election, I, on behalf of the Government made good a commitment to reconsider them, and took them to 25.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think there is a need to say any more than that. We are talking about an agreement, a deal, a commitment&mdash;the words are all the same. I do not think anyone could quibble that it was secret because the matter emerged only after Mr Black revealed it on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> some months after the event. All I can say is that, if anyone has prejudged the outcome, it is Senator Loosley. On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS> last night he very wisely said that there was no deal. He obviously has not read the transcript and, in all fairness, I think he ought to do that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are talking about the way in which the committee has operated, it is worth remembering a couple of important things. This is very significant. There are a number of crucial matters of public importance. The whole role of the Foreign Investment Review Board and its effectiveness are crucial issues to public policy considerations in this country. Yet what we have had to date is, to say the least, a marked reluctance for any cooperation on the part of government. The Prime Minister treats the Senate committees with contempt. The Treasurer (Mr Willis) puts every obstacle in the way of the committee and declines any invitation to attend. Those who are on the committee, particularly Senator Loosley and Senator Carr, have no compunction about doing all that they can to derail the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will not be distracted or deterred. We understand what their political agenda is. It seems to me that today they are demonstrating beyond doubt that the committee is being effective in its work. We are not prejudging anything. We are not doing anything other than pursuing the terms of reference, and it is very important that we do that. I understand why they are desperate to undermine the committee. I do not quite understand however why Senator Loosley and Senator Carr should go out to the media and brief it comprehensively in the way they did after a private meeting of the committee had been held. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans raised two matters. One was that I had brought pressure to bear on Mr Kohler. Let me just repeat Mr Kohler's lines:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He just rang up for a chat and it was quite a friendly kind of call, and he just said he had a few concerns about our coverage of the leadership issues. He thought that one or two of our reporters were running an agenda, and he just wanted to express that concern.</PARA>

<PARA>If that is the best evidence that those opposite have got that I was asking for balance, then Mr Kohler has comprehensively refuted it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would also like to speak to the motion to take note of Senator Gareth Evans's answer to Senator Carr's question. Quite correctly, Senator Evans did raise the question about propriety. I would like to address that because it is a very important matter. This committee was set up on the motion of Senator Alston on behalf of the opposition. The committee's terms of reference went to particular matters, including:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) whether those decisions were influenced by considerations relating to the content of newspapers including any requirement for `balanced' coverage;</PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (iv) stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(iv) whether the Prime Minister influenced or sought to influence those decisions, and, if so, the basis on which and the extent to which he did so;</PARA>
<PARA>On the question of what decision this committee is going to reach and hand down in the Senate, Senator Alston says that he has made no comment that would influence the outcome of any report. When Senator Alston moved that motion he said that it was hoped, in respect of the refusal of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to appear before the committee, that `he will appreciate the implications of his threatened non-attendance, particularly the possibility that adverse inferences may well be drawn even by impartial observers who are anxious to ascertain what it was that really led to the two most recent decisions on foreign ownership in relation to print media'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston, on two occasions, has now publicly stated, in a conclusive way, that there was an agreement between the Prime Minister and Conrad Black. He further said that there was a secret deal between the Prime Minister and Conrad Black. In terms of evidence, if there is anything which shows somebody drawing a conclusion, surely that is it. As chairman of the committee, Senator Alston has a responsibility to act in the most impartial way. Surely he ought to do that if for no other reason than that he is chairman of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His private views are his own, whatever they are, but he ought not state them publicly. The opposition has the numbers on this committee if Senator Kernot chooses to support its views, and clearly we would expect that the majority report would now reflect Senator Alston's statements to the press. If it does not, then he does not have the support of his other committee members.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support Senator Evans in saying that propriety clearly has been breached in this instance. We should not allow the committee to continue with a chairman who has not acted impartially. For that reason, he should not continue as the chairman of this committee. Senator Alston also said that he did not address the question of balanced reporting with Mr Kohler. He did say that to the committee. It is certainly my recollection, as a member of the committee, that he raised the issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may have been said flippantly, but the fact is that it was said. It is a very bad joke, and I know that Senator Kernot agrees it is a very bad joke. In terms of the subsequent letter that Senator Alston refers to that he received from Mr Kohler, one would have to wonder why Mr Kohler even wrote to Senator Alston. Supposedly it was because this article had been leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> and he wanted to clarify that it was not he who had leaked the article. One would have to wonder why Mr Kohler would do that without any request from Senator Alston. He all of a sudden wrote a letter saying, `Well, it wasn't me who told them'.

We should not lose sight of the fact that the committee's own terms of reference, written by Senator Alston, sought to determine whether or not there was any deal and whether or not there were any statements made. He cannot then publicly say conclusively that there were. He has an obligation to the committee and to the Senate to act impartially, and he has not done so.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that the government senators on this committee ought to get their facts straight. I refer firstly to comments made by Alan Kohler yesterday on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Today</EMPHASIS> program on the ABC. He was interviewed in relation to this very matter. He said that Senator Alston contacted him in relation to the coverage by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> of the leadership questions in the Liberal Party. He said that Senator Alston made it very clear that he was calling as shadow minister for communications and on behalf of John Hewson. Mr Kohler said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . during the conversation, and I said to him, you know, `You're not asking me for balance, are you, Senator Alston?', and he laughed and he said he wouldn't dream of asking such a thing. And it was kind of . . . a bit of that banter.</PARA>
<PARA>He is corroborating what Senator Alston said in relation to the joke that he made. It was a joke&mdash;and, in fact, Senator Alston was contacting Mr Kohler about something completely different. Mr Kohler revealed that during the previous week he had had three, four or five contacts from various politicians. He said, `It kind of goes on all the time'. In fact, Paul Kelly, who was interviewed on the same station, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, I don't know exactly what Senator Alston said, but I see absolutely nothing improper in that at all. I mean, it's going to be a sad and sorry day if we get to the stage where journalists or editors believe it's improper for politicians to ring them up.</PARA>
<PARA>I remind the government senators on the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media to remember that the terms of reference do relate to specific matters. They relate to the origin and basis of decisions in 1991 and 1993 to increase the permissible percentage of foreign ownership of newspapers, and that would go up to about March 1993. They do not involve anything which has happened since then. For the government senators on this committee to suggest that members of the committee, including the chairman, are not at liberty to phone up an editor or a journalist in this country and say that they are not being properly treated or they are not being given accurate coverage is absolutely outrageous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hate it if government senators ever served on a jury because I am damn sure they would not look at the facts of the matter before them. In this case the facts are before them and they should look at what Mr Kohler said. Mr Kohler said that in no way did he feel that any influence was being brought to bear. </PARA>

In fact, in his own words, Mr Kohler admitted that he was the first one to raise balance, and he did so as a joke.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kohler said that Senator Alston made it abundantly clear that he was approaching him on a matter completely separate to that which is under inquiry by this committee. Even Paul Kelly, when he was interviewed, thought that this was farcical. He said, `I would never complain about politicians, whatever committee they are heading, calling up and making their views known'. Undoubtedly, at one stage or another honourable senators in this chamber have called a journalist or an editor to make their views known. It is completely proper, in the process of democracy in this country, that honourable members exercise their roles as senators by contacting journalists and editors when they feel they have been hard done by. Every one of us has felt that an article has been unfair either to our party or ourselves. We are at liberty to call the journalist who wrote the article or the newspaper and put our view forward. That is all that Senator Alston was doing: he was talking about something completely different. </PARA>

Really, Senate select committees ought not to be abused in this way; they ought not to become vehicles by which people can be abused. There is no doubt that this inquiry was conceived in political malice. I do not make that reference to the Australian Democrats because I understand Senator Kernot's principal concern rested with the workings of the Foreign Investment Review Board and foreign investment policy generally. It would have been far better had there never been the political malice demonstrated in respect of the Fairfax takeover and had the foreign investment questions been dealt with separately by a Senate standing committee with all the processes of due deliberation and care. It would have been an infinitely better circumstance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation we now have is that the Select Committee on Print Media, Foreign Ownership Decisions has become a continuing embarrassment to the opposition rather than to the government because of the behaviour of the chair. I will not make personal references. What has been going on is just plain silly: the manner in which the government was excluded from the loop of information, the way in which people waltzed into the Senate and moved motions without consulting the committee and now political intervention. </PARA>

The simple issue is political intervention, that in respect to the phone call to Mr Kohler, the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Senator Alston did not tell the committee the whole story. He did not tell us the complete and unalterable truth. He never mentioned the fact that Dr Hewson had asked him to make the call.

It has been characterised by partisanship, by incompetence and by foolishness. Matters may or may not be coming to a head this evening in terms of the standards that should apply to the chair of a Senate select committee. A single standard ought to be maintained for everybody on both sides of the chamber.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Alston was quoted twice in the last 24 hours&mdash;he may have said it on other occasions, but I have only seen two quotes&mdash;I really thought that a deal had been done, an arrangement had been concluded and that he had predetermined matters. My view is that part of the terms of reference cited by Senator Ellison earlier required the committee to look at the circumstances of the Fairfax takeover in 1991 and related matters to see whether there had been any quid pro quo and any arrangement. I say without fear of contradiction that no evidence before the committee to date suggests that in any way, shape or form. I have no doubt that when we come to deliver the final report no evidence in those terms will have been presented to the committee. </PARA>

Is it his line or is it the line of the paper?'. That is what Senator Alston told the committee. They are not my words; they are the words of the chairman of the committee.

<PARA>There is no doubt in anybody's mind that the rapid change in the composition of the global atmosphere is the most important threat ever to the global environment. We now have samples 200,000 years old from ice cores; we know what the composition of the atmosphere has been; and we know that the composition of the global atmosphere is changing faster than at any time in geological history. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we know that this change in the atmosphere is being brought about by human activities&mdash;by the burning of fossil fuels and by various other activities. So this is a human produced change which is more rapid than at any time in geological history. We also know that some 40 per cent of all photosynthetic activity on earth is now being consumed either directly or indirectly by humans. When I raised this question with Senator Schacht several weeks ago, he did not even understand the question. It means that some 30 million other species with which we share this planet have only about 60 per cent of that photosynthetic activity available for all their activities of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth stressing that when we look out from the outer reaches of the solar system, as we have been able to do with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Voyager</EMPHASIS> spacecraft journeys, we find that on all the evidence this is the only place in the whole universe which is capable of supporting life, either our form of life or any other form of life. Yet we are carrying out this enormous experiment on the life support systems of this planet. It is quite true, as we may hear from either the government or the opposition, that we do not know what the consequences of this change will be. There are certainly predictions. The intergovernmental panel on climate change has made estimates in relation to changes in global climate, changes in temperature, changes in rainfall and so forth. One must comment that the changes which have been observed are consistent with those models. We are indeed on track for the sorts of changes that those 200 scientists from over 20 countries on two separate occasions have predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we are conducting this enormous experiment on the life support systems of the only planet which is capable of supporting life and we really do not know fully what the consequences are. This suggests, in line with the ecologically sustainable development principle of precaution, that we should proceed as slowly as possible to change the atmosphere. In other words, we should slow down our rates of burning of fossil fuel; we should slow down those other activities which are affecting the composition of the atmosphere. We should slow down those activities as much as we possibly can until we know what the consequences are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole reason for raising this debate this afternoon is simply that, on all the indications, the government has accepted, temporarily, a very weak set of recommendations. It has not done anything to implement those recommendations and we fear it is now going to move away even from those very weak recommendations for stabilisation by the year 2000 and a 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005 based on the 1988 figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be asserted&mdash;and has been asserted by the opposition in particular but no less on occasions by the government&mdash;that there is some conflict between the economy and the environment. We could easily achieve these targets of stabilisation and a 20 per cent reduction by the year 2005 while benefiting the economy. I stress most strongly that Australia, because of its procrastination, is being left behind. Other countries are instituting energy efficiency; other countries are developing more efficient ways of production. They are reducing their costs by doing that and are stealing a march on Australia. So there is in this instance no conflict between the achievement of these targets and the economic wellbeing of this country either in terms of profitability or in terms of employment&mdash;indeed, the two things are consonant. We can achieve those greenhouse targets. We can do better, and we can improve the economy and employment at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> reports that a letter has been sent to various ministers&mdash;Minister Cook, Minister Collins and Minister Beddall&mdash;arguing against taxes on energy. The letter is quoted as saying any reductions would have serious trade and competitive consequences for our industries. Do people know that Japan already produces steel using half the amount of energy that Australia uses? Do they know that Japan produces that efficiency because it has high energy costs? Do they know that Japan is able to out-compete Australia in so many ways because it has achieved that efficiency? There is no conflict whatsoever between the achievement of those sorts of reductions in CO(2) emissions and the achievement of an improved economy and an improved employment situation as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to transport. With great difficulty I convinced the government that it should go down the road of supporting ethanol as an alternative fuel. Fortunately, we have now embarked on that road, and Australia is well on the way to developing some very exciting technology which will make ethanol as cheap as petrol. We will indeed be able to use a renewable fuel, provided that the government is serious about supporting the remaining research in the development of ethanol from cellulose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We already have the world's best technology in solar hot water; a technology which is present in only 6 per cent of Australia's homes. With the application of solar hot water alone we could very substantially reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from electricity generating stations. But we do not find this federal government consistently and seriously addressing the problem of the recalcitrants&mdash;and I use that word deliberately&mdash;of the electricity utilities around Australia, which have simply sought to increase their production of electricity rather than use least-cost planning to produce a system which has energy service use at the point of use as its principal objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest very strongly that the federal government use its corporations powers, as it did in the case of Tasmania, to say to the electricity utilities around Australia, `You shall import no more heavy generating equipment into Australia for the next 25 years', to force the utilities to adopt least-cost planning and to provide, through various incentives, ways in which domestic hot water services might be just as competitive as the provision of electric hot water. People do not basically need electricity; they need hot water; they need the services which electricity and other energy forms make available. We can do that with fewer greenhouse gas emissions, with more employment and at lower cost by going down the road of alternative energy and energy efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The intergovernmental panel on climate change has twice said that we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible. Translated into Australia's terms, that means a 92 per cent reduction on a per capita basis. The government has accepted a very weak figure when it suggests stabilisation by 2000, and a 20 per cent reduction by 2005. I am very concerned that the government is going to move away from those adopted standards. I urge the government to stay with those standards or, if possible, to improve on them. Next Monday, 21 March, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change will come into force. For the first time Australia, like the other parties to the convention, will be legally required to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, yet the Australian government&mdash;against the weight of international, scientific and political opinion&mdash;has pulled back from the commitments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In October 1990 the Commonwealth government, along with state, territory and local governments, adopted the national interim planning target and agreed to develop a nationally coordinated response. The interim planning target is sometimes, however, mischaracterised, and unfortunately that has happened today. Senator Coulter has not included it at all, because it should be noted that after the words `the year 2005' in his motion the rest of the sentence continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . subject to Australia not implementing response measures that would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse producing countries.</PARA>
<PARA>They are significant words, and I do not think we can ever in this debate avoid confronting them. The target adopted by Australia has a high degree of synergy with the commitments and principles in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. It recognises that there is a range of important greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, and it does not limit action to a single gas. It also recognises the importance of a global response in order to effectively counter the challenge posed by increasing greenhouse gas emissions. It also recognises that concerted action must take place within the framework of a sustainable Australian economy and a sustainable Australian trade competitiveness as well as protecting the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as Australia adopted the interim planning target, the international community&mdash;recognising that the prospect of global climate change resulting from enhanced greenhouse effects presents some of the most far-reaching problems ever faced&mdash;agreed to develop a framework convention on climate change under the auspices of the United Nations. The Rio Earth Summit developed a convention that was open for signature at that landmark conference. Australia, along with 150 other nations, signed the convention and announced that we would work towards its early entry into force. We took the pledge seriously, becoming the ninth nation to lodge an instrument of ratification with the United Nations as far back as December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time, we were developing Australia's national response, becoming one of the first countries in the world to develop an action plan&mdash;the national greenhouse response strategy, which I will refer to later. As Senator Cook said, next Monday is a landmark day because it is the day that the convention comes into force. The necessary 50 ratifications needed to bring the convention into force were achieved in December of last year. I suppose that, in itself, is not of great moment but it is worth noting that among the 50 nations were the US, the European Union, Japan, China and India. They are the nations that are the major greenhouse gas emitters. That event will trigger a series of activities that will culminate in the first conference of the parties, which will occur in Berlin in March 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues can be divided into two streams of activity: operational and institutional arrangements that must be put in place to assure the rapid implementation of the convention; and work in preparation for the first review of the adequacy of the emissions commitments in the convention. The review of the adequacy of the convention's commitments was formally discussed for the first time at the February 1994 meeting of the negotiating body. Resulting from those discussions, there is now a widespread acceptance that the convention's existing commitments are inadequate and need to be strengthened. As a result of this widespread agreement, there is now a strong expectation that the first conference of the parties will launch a negotiating process for a protocol that will establish further and more detailed commitments to move the global community towards meeting the objective of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to state quite clearly that, contrary to what some have been saying, Australian support has not diminished or evaporated on the question of the adoption of targets and timetables that acknowledge the principles embedded in the convention, such as the comprehensive approach and equitable burden sharing. At the last negotiating meeting, the Australian delegation also made this point during the discussions on the review of the adequacy of the convention's commitments. However, we also have to recognise that, without credible action by Australia domestically, we will not have any standing internationally to influence events. We are going to have to make sure that our act is in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consistent with this, the Commonwealth government has been pursuing as a priority the adoption and further development of the national greenhouse response strategy. The Council of Australian Governments endorsed that strategy at its meeting in December 1992. Australia's national greenhouse response strategy contains a comprehensive framework for taking action. The three-pronged goal of that framework is as follows: to contribute towards effective global action to limit greenhouse gas emissions and enhance greenhouse gas sinks; to improve knowledge and understanding of the enhanced greenhouse effect; and to prepare for potential impacts of climate change in Australia. The framework also contains a set of objectives and strategies for key economic sectors and areas of public sector activity and some initial actions to abate greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out some of the general principles which underlie all of the response measures. These are specified in the strategy. It is important to understand what they are because they guide and explain Australia's approach to responding to the threat of climate change. Response measures should be effective in furthering the strategy goal and be economically efficient. Perhaps more importantly, from Senator Coulter's point of view, one of the principles is that response measures should be directed towards the interim planning target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The strategy is a phased plan of action towards limiting greenhouse gas emissions, conserving and enhancing greenhouse gas sinks and preparing for the potential impacts of climate change. It also provides for research and analysis&mdash;which I note Senator Coulter referred to&mdash;amongst other things, to provide a clearer definition of the range of response options and their associated benefits and costs and to develop appropriate technologies to implement response actions. Certainly, in accordance with some undertakings that I have given to Senator Coulter privately, over the next few days I will be taking up with the department some of the matters that he raised here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the strategy contains mechanisms for continued monitoring of the programs identified and for assessing performance in the actions, as well as arrangements for the periodic review and continuing development of the strategy. That includes the scope to reassess objectives as we go along and to reassess programs in the light of new scientific information in this area, because we are getting new scientific information all the time. Therefore, we will monitor international developments, we will monitor the effectiveness of the response actions and we will make sure as we go along that if we need to change then change we shall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first reporting on progress with implementing measures and the further development of the strategy is under way. The first part of the report that was presented to COAG summarised the implementation of measures in the strategy in the first year since it was endorsed. The second part of that report will be presented at the next meeting and it will deal with some further issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did make a comment about the response strategy as endorsed in December 1992. It contains only an initial range of actions to abate greenhouse gas emissions. The important thing to note is that more can be done, more is being done and more will be done. Measures adopted in the first phase include actions focused particularly on the energy and transport sectors and things like energy efficient standards for a range of equipment and goods, provision of the information of energy users and looking at environmentally favourable electricity generation technologies, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further actions have been taken by the Commonwealth since the adoption of the strategy, for example, the funding of development of a national greenhouse inventory; encouragement for alternative fuels with a guaranteed excise-free period and with legislation to be introduced soon on a bounty to support development of an ethanol fuel industry; and a research project by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics into possible measures in the transport sector. Also, the Commonwealth is a major sponsor of a study to define opportunities for biomass derived energy and the development of a strategic plan for those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The available menu of potential actions is greater than that considered for the strategy in 1992. It will also grow with time, for example, with improvements in relevant information, technological developments and economic changes. In addition, the development of measures considered to date for the national greenhouse response strategy has largely been limited to Commonwealth and state-territory government actions. The Commonwealth will canvass with the states some proposal which would draw together a picture of Australia's progress by mid-1994. We will then present that to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the beginning of the statement, the interim planning target has a high degree of synergy with the convention. I think it may be useful to conclude with the objective of the convention, perhaps one of the most important objectives ever crafted in an international treaty, which illustrates the synergy of which I speak. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to stabilise greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Such a level should be achieved within a time frame sufficient to allow ecosystems to adapt naturally to climate change, to ensure that food production is not threatened and to enable economic development to proceed in a sustainable manner.</PARA>

It is interesting to note that the analysis of air from previous centuries captured in the Arctic ice and atmospheric measurements taken since the 1950s confirms the rapid increase of carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because carbon dioxide captures heat in the atmosphere, it follows that we could expect some increase in global temperatures as carbon dioxide levels increase. Fortunately, the equation is not that simple. If it were, we would be experiencing a much greater rise in temperature than the 0.6 degree centigrade rise that has been measured over the last century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists have tried to model the effects, but the models have been crude compared with the complexity of the system. Early models predicted temperature rises of four to five degrees and accompanying sea rises, due to thermal expansion, of one to two metres. More recent models, however, have predicted a smaller temperature rise of one to two degrees and a tidal rise of 20 centimetres by the year 2030. Many important questions remain to be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real fear that, as temperatures are not increasing in concert with the increase in greenhouse gases, a critical point may be reached at which the ability of the world to absorb more carbon dioxide is exceeded and a large and sudden rise in temperature occurs as a consequence. It would be foolish for governments to ignore the possibility of global warming. It is the responsibility of governments to keep an open mind, to monitor scientific evidence and to continually adjust policy on the basis of that evidence. It is also essential that governments continue to monitor costs to business and employment as a result of any action they take on global warming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is said that more than half of the carbon dioxide emissions in Australia come from the burning of coal. That is why the electricity industry, with its coal burning power stations, is often in the firing line. By cutting down on the use of electricity and by using it more efficiently, Australia will cut down its emission of carbon dioxide. Australia contributes only two per cent of the global greenhouse gases and, consequently, any reduction in our emissions would have only a minimal effect on the overall problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australia's per capita emission of greenhouse gases per annum is 11 tonnes compared with the world average of 2.5 tonnes. We are one of the highest per capita users of energy and emitters of greenhouse gases. Unless we reduce our own emissions, we will not have the right to entreat other nations to reduce or restrict theirs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a developed country with high per capita greenhouse emissions, we should take the lead in developing techniques and technologies that can be used by less developed countries to contain their greenhouse emissions as they continue to develop. I think Senator Coulter made the point earlier that there is business and money in developing and selling those strategies and techniques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an attempt to address the problem of greenhouse and its effects on climate change, the United Nations developed its convention on climate change. The convention was put to the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development, known as the Rio conference, held in Brazil in June 1992. The developing countries which signed the convention agreed to a number of commitments, including the recognition that a return to earlier levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2000 was desirable&mdash;I emphasise `was desirable'&mdash;and their eventual aim of returning to the 1990 levels of emission in due course. The convention was not precise about the level of stabilisation by the year 2000 or about when signatory countries should return to 1990 levels of emission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1990 the Australian government set an interim planning target for the stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions at the 1988 level by the year 2000 and a 20 per cent reduction in that level by the year 2005. These targets are more ambitious than the targets that Australia agreed to when it signed the UN Convention on Climate Change two years later. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the failures of the government in this matter has been its failure to consult with industry. It has consulted widely with environmental groups, but it has not consulted nearly as widely with industry. If it had done that, it would have a better appreciation, a better balance and a better idea of the problems those emissions cause to the environment and also the effect of any solutions on business, industry, jobs and employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been a little hypocritical on this matter. While exhorting industry to cut its emissions, the government has failed to develop a comprehensive education program for business or domestic users. Further, its own actions in this regard have been less than impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier last year the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the department given responsibility for increasing energy efficiency, was criticised by the Auditor-General's office. The Auditor-General was critical about the government's implementation of the interim greenhouse response initiatives, and concluded that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy had taken insufficient implementation action, even though there was a degree of urgency intended by the government. In its own program of energy efficiency the department had made almost no progress in a two-year program. It was already one year behind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, the government has been criticised for not evaluating fully the potential implications of its greenhouse emission targets. There are genuine fears within industry that Australia has set itself too high a target for the reduction of greenhouse emissions. In attempting to meet the target additional costs will be put on industry, which will make it less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention that the Business Council of Australia is concerned that the target is inappropriate, given Australia's dependence on fossil fuels, the increasing population and the importance of energy-intensive industries. It would mean a massive cost and structural disruption to attempt to meet the targets proposed by Senator Coulter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics has estimated that to achieve this target would cost $40 billion and would effectively lead to the demise of Australia's coal industry. In other words, if we go too quickly or are too severe, or do not think these restrictions out carefully enough, we will find ourselves exporting jobs overseas as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a concern as to how governments might regulate to reduce emissions. Possible mechanisms include the setting of goals for emissions, selling pollution `rights', taxes, regulations, subsidies and education. Industry has made it clear that in improving its environmental outcomes it would rather have goals than regulations. It believes it can often reach a goal more cheaply by innovative techniques than it can by conforming to government regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current emphasis by the government is on education, but the spectre of an energy tax will not go away, especially as to this government an energy tax has the increased government attraction of more revenue. It behoves the government to deny and to put out of contention that it is likely to do that. </PARA>

For that reason, the Greens (WA) welcome the opportunity to support this motion, and to present the urgency of it to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pleasingly, the minister, Senator Richardson, referred to the measures and support for an increase in the timetable and standards that have been expressed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson used part of his statement to talk about a no regrets measure in there being a qualification on the kinds of changes that the government is prepared to look at within Australia as measures to reduce greenhouse gas. I believe he was referring to the definition of `no regrets measures' in the national greenhouse response strategy as those measures that had net benefits in addition to limiting greenhouse gas emissions. He used it in an unfortunate way which could be construed to exclude emission reduction options which are cost-effective or have no net costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to bear in mind that there are many examples where the alternative strategies are not being properly looked at. An example is my own home state of Western Australia where the $14 billion project, the North West Shelf, is running at a loss. While the cost of production is running from $16 to $22 per litre of oil or gas equivalent, it is selling at $14 a litre. Therefore, the country is subsidising an industry which is destroying our atmosphere at a colossal rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone pointed out to me the other day, if we allowed every household in Australia either tax incentives or subsidies for solar heaters, it would be a fraction of the cost and reduce the damage that we are pouring into the atmosphere throughout the world as a result of the oil and gas that we are selling. The business sector in this country does not yet accept the responsibility for the change in the climate that is required so that we can actually see not only an improvement economically, but also a dramatic change to the way in which we reduce our emissions and fulfil our national responsibilities. </PARA>

I entered this debate with some apprehension, taking on Senator Coulter in the area of his expertise and lifetime dedication. But I have truly put aside those apprehensions because Senator Coulter really did not speak to concerns of the community on this motion. Rather, he took us into the solar system, the outer reaches of the universe, to tell us there was no life out there at all. I do not know why he thought that was relevant. Perhaps he was thinking of migrating at some stage&mdash;if this world should come to an end, then Senator Coulter would jump off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter delved into a number of alternative lifestyles, which seems to be a favourite topic of his. I think the candle wax alternative to energy is Senator Coulter's favourite and most preferred policy. Senator Coulter has to understand, in pushing for this motion to be accepted&mdash;if it were read by those in Australian households, they would not understand it&mdash;that there are more concerns than just alternative energy policies. There are jobs and livelihoods on the line. I was very disappointed that, in the 10 minutes available to Senator Coulter, he did not show a great deal more sophistication in his approach to this matter because, as I said, he is the so-called expert in this area; he has spent a lifetime studying it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, although this motion is accepted by the coalition as having some merit, if Senator Coulter and his policies are set loose, they are, in fact, quite dangerous and a threat to the economic well-being of Australia. The motion before the Senate basically deals with a new age concept of the greenhouse effect. Senator Coulter is calling for the enforcement of the 1990 Rio conference agreement, to which Australia was a signatory with 48 other countries. From the Rio conference, the federal government has adopted an interim planning target of stabilising emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, based on the 1988 levels, by the year 2000, and reducing these emissions by 20 per cent by the year 2005&mdash;an ambitious program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is believed that this target would stabilise the greenhouse gas emissions and stem the alleged and, indeed, phoney prophecies of severe climate change and overheating of the earth. This is being pushed as the politically correct line, but is it real? Scientific data and commentary of late that are starting to come in weigh heavily against the perceived dangers of the greenhouse effect&mdash;those extreme examples put forward by Senator Coulter and his colleagues. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While carbon dioxide levels are going up, it can be said that there is no direct link with current climatic changes. It is not a scientific fact. In fact, Senator Coulter would be hard pressed to find substantial climatic changes anywhere in the world today. All are marginal climatic changes, other than the normal and expected evolutionary changes in climate. This is borne out by the fact that the doomsday predictions of the 1980s have fallen flat in the 1990s. I will refer to two of those predictions of the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scientists at the 1987 greenhouse conference, which was held in Melbourne, warned of higher temperatures, rising sea levels, changing rainfall patterns and more frequent and more violent weather extremes, such as cyclones and storms. It was predicted that about 50,000 square kilometres of coastal land would be flooded if sea levels rose an estimated 140 centimetres beyond the year 2000; the year 2030 was referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted in relation to these doomsday predictions that even the then minister for science, Barry Jones, who is also an expert in the field, saw fit to make qualifications in 1987 regarding these predictions; none of them even looked like occurring. He saw fit, in his opening remarks, to say that much more research was needed because scientists did not yet know enough to accurately predict the impact of the greenhouse effect. Quite frankly, it is now 1994 and most of those predictions have been debunked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987, there was the great prediction by a group of CSIRO scientists that climatic changes may mean that by the middle of the next century every year would be a potential Ash Wednesday year of extreme bushfire. The article said, `It is the first time the possibility of such a dramatic increase in bushfire risk has been linked to global warming'. That has also been debunked. That is the last time the bushfire risk will ever be linked to global warming. The green movement is fighting a rearguard action in relation to bushfires. They now have to explain how controlled burning and controlled logging are not a better policy for preventing bushfires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These obsessions have been debunked in the 1990s. Not one of these doomsday predictions even looks like it could occur. The likes of Senator Coulter and those pushing the Rio convention have on their agenda the introduction of a tax upon energy to meet the Rio convention requirements. Such a tax would have a devastating effect upon the living standards of all Australians as the Australian economy is very dependent upon natural resources. Australia is even more dependent upon natural resources than the other signatories to the Rio convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the world's largest exporters of coal, the second largest exporter of aluminium and iron ore and is also a significant producer of steel, oil and gas. Yet the export abilities or wealth of the other signatories to the Rio convention do not have such a dependence on energy resources. For example, let us compare Australia with France. Eighty per cent of France's power generation is nuclear. Australia's nuclear power generation is zero. Obviously, France has less to lose in meeting the Rio guidelines than has Australia, as nuclear generation has zero gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has Senator Coulter considered the following effect: in the search for cheaper and more efficient power, post-carbon tax, Australia would be driven to the nuclear option? Is that an option that Senator Coulter supports? I think not. When the lights go out on our electricity industry&mdash;predominantly fuelled by coal&mdash;what option does Senator Coulter propose to turn on the lights around Australia? I truly believe that Senator Coulter would prefer the candle wax option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's position is not in favour of the nuclear option. This has been clearly stated by the shadow minister.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have to place some balance upon Senator Coulter's urgency motion I conclude by saying that, further to that, we support the no regrets policy, which Senator Coulter would be familiar with. It is a policy where all efforts will be made to reduce CO2 emissions&mdash;we accept that&mdash;to a point that does not affect the basic standards of living, competitiveness and trading ability of our country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August 1993, at the South Pacific Forum, Australia signed a communique which reaffirmed that global warming and sea level rise are among the most serious threats to the Pacific region and to the very survival of some island states.

That has been signed; we are waiting for the action commensurate with that signing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another matter that led to Senator Coulter being inspired to move this urgency motion today is that this government, behind its rhetoric, has presided over an increase in carbon dioxide emissions at a time when emission reduction is becoming more and more urgent. The National Grid Management Council has released projections that show that emissions from electricity generation only will be at least 67 per cent higher than the interim planning target by 2005 if current policies are followed.

It would create jobs for Australians and improve Australia's economy by reducing our greenhouse emissions and our need to import either fuels or energy sources from overseas. But what do we do?

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 42nd Report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Possible Adverse Treatment of a Witness before the Corporations and Securities Committee, was tabled in the Senate on 27 May 1993. Included in its findings and recommendations was the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate resolve as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That the Senate is of the opinion that all heads of departments and other agencies, statutory office holders and Senior Executive Service officers should be required, as part of their duties, to undertake study of the principles governing the operation of Parliament, and the accountability of their departments, agencies and authorities to the Houses of Parliament and their committees, with particular reference to the rights and responsibilities of, and protection afforded to, witnesses before parliamentary committees. (paragraph 3.8)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate adopted the recommendation on 21 October 1993 and this response gives details of action taken to implement the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following passage of the Senate resolution, my predecessor, the Hon. Kerry Sibraa, wrote to all Ministers advising them of its passage. Similarly, the Clerk of the Senate wrote to the heads of all departments, and to the Public Service Commission, drawing attention to the terms of the resolution. I understand that the Chairperson of the Committee of Privileges advised all Ministers of the content of the report and also of the 36th Report of that Committee, which raised similar concerns.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The content of the reports was drawn to the attention of all Senior Executive Officers in an article written by the Secretary to the Committee and published in SES News of December 1993, in response to an invitation by the Public Service Commission. The Clerk of the Senate has since spoken at one of the SES management seminars which are conducted by the Public Service Commission. It may be hoped that his participation will be a regular feature of subsequent programs.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The earliest response to the recommendations of the report came from the Australian Securities Commission, which, soon after the tabling of the report, arranged for Senators and senior Senate staff to conduct seminars for the Commission's senior officers. So far, these full-day seminars have been conducted in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, and the senior officers who attended included a Commissioner of the ASC, and Regional Commissioners from New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. A further seminar is scheduled for Perth at the end of April.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Brisbane was also the venue for a seminar conducted for regional heads of Commonwealth departments and authorities, organised on the initiative of the Queensland Regional Commissioner of the Australian Securities Commission, who is also the convenor of that group.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator the Hon. Margaret Reynolds, Chairperson of the Committee of Privileges, participated in both Brisbane seminars. Senator John Coates, another member of the Committee and Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, addressed another regional seminar, in Bowral, New South Wales, for regional heads of departments and agencies and for heads of agencies based in Sydney. Senator Bruce Childs, the longest standing member of the Privileges Committee, spoke at the first ASC seminar, held in Sydney, while Senator Rod Kemp addressed ASC officers in Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Procedure Office has received several approaches from departments in Canberra, and has conducted two seminars for all SES officers of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. A further seminar is to be conducted in April, covering SES representatives of several departments. It would be helpful if central agencies such as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commission were to become more actively involved in implementing the Senate resolution. The Department of the Senate would, of course, be happy to cooperate and in the meantime intends to continue its programs to meet individual departmental demands.</PARA>

<PARA>Mr President, I wish to underline the importance of your response and the very good work that has flowed since the adoption, here in the Senate, of the report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. Mr President, I know that your two-page response has been incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record and will be read by a wide number of interested persons, not the least of whom will be senior officers of the Public Service in all departments not only here in Canberra but in the states, in all the regions where Commonwealth officers serve. It would pay not only Commonwealth public servants but, indeed, state public servants&mdash;all decision makers who have any dealings with the Commonwealth parliament&mdash;to study the recommendations of the Standing Committee of Privileges, particularly the 42nd and, indeed, the 36th reports of the committee. There is a report currently before the chamber on the Australian Customs Service which I believe also will repay similar study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the upshot of this whole matter? It is this: citizens of Australia have rights, including the right to make a submission to the parliament without any personal detriment to themselves as a result of making such a submission. They can appear before a Senate committee in a public hearing and they can write a letter to the parliament. We must safeguard the right of every Australian citizen</PARA>
<PARA>to so act. We must ensure that, if there is any infringement upon citizens because they have taken up such a right, there is redress for that and there is no detriment, no punishment and no loss or suffering as a result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I use the 42nd report of the committee as an example. This has been addressed by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. Mr Acting Deputy President Childs, you are the longest serving member of the committee and are very aware of the principles about which I will now speak. Senator Reynolds, who is the current chairman of that committee, is in the chamber. I happen to be the deputy chairman. We also have in the chamber, sitting in the Clerk's chair, the Deputy Clerk, who is the secretary of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Ellison, who will speak following my remarks, is a new and rising star, if I might put it that way, on the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. Every single member of the committee goes about his or her work in a bona fide way and I am proud of each of them. The last time I was able to say that was on the occasion of the retirement of the then chairman, Senator Patricia Giles, and Senator Durack. Both of those former senators are from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to divert from the issue. I wish to highlight that we had a serious matter of law reform before the Australian parliament. The Australian Securities Commission made a very deliberate submission and its representatives appeared before the committee asked by the parliament to inquire into that law reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the middle ranking&mdash;some would say junior&mdash;lawyers serving in the Australian Securities Commission quite conscientiously, as a citizen, had a contrary view. That lawyer put forward a view which was quite contrary to that of his employer. As a result of that, in part&mdash;there were other complicating factors, and these were all addressed in our report&mdash;this person was dismissed from his employment. One of the reasons for the dismissal cited by the head of the ASC's Victorian office was that the lawyer had made a submission to the parliamentary inquiry which was directly contrary to the view of his employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As soon as it was drawn to the attention of that person, and indeed to the attention of the Australian Securities Commission, the commission immediately saw the seriousness of its mistake; that it had acted&mdash;some would say it had acted inadvertently or out of ignorance, but certainly without taking responsible action&mdash;to punish that person for exercising his ordinary civil rights as an Australian citizen. That whole matter has now been settled. A finding of contempt for that action was found by the committee and by the Senate, and that matter has been very seriously understood within the Australian Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is so cheering to me as a senator in the way the President has responded with these two pages of summary of the action that has flowed since October when the Senate adopted that report is a wide-ranging set of activities alerting virtually the Commonwealth Public Service to the law of the land and to the rights of Australian citizens and, in particular, public servants, as individuals, to make submissions to parliament; and for them to be able to exercise that right without any detriment or punishment. This has been highlighted by the President of the Senate in the way he has summarised the circulation of the Senate's resolution on this matter by his predecessor, the Hon. Kerry Sibraa; by the Clerk of the Senate in writing to all Commonwealth departments; and by the chair of the Standing Committee of Privileges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem this set of correspondence has been well received. The evidence of this is that there has been a request for this to be brought to the attention of all senior executive officers. The secretary of the committee was asked to, and did, write an article about this for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">SES News</EMPHASIS> of December last year. This is available and was circulated to the most senior officers in the Commonwealth Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, the Australian Securities Commission, in many ways the subject of that report, has taken concrete steps to convene seminars in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane&mdash;and, with regard to regional commissioners, in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, the ACT and the Northern Territory, with another one planned for Perth&mdash;to clarify for ASC officers what the law of the land is on this matter so that the ASC will never again transgress the rights  of an Australian citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been responses from other regional heads of Commonwealth departments. For example, there has been a seminar for those people in Brisbane. We have also very happily seen such seminars inviting appropriate and well-informed senators to address conferences and seminars of public servants. Senator Reynolds has done so; Senator Coates, another long serving member of the committee has done so; and you, Mr Acting Deputy President, have done so. Senator Kemp responded to an invitation to speak directly to the Australian Securities Commission officers in Melbourne, which is where the original problem arose. In addition, the Procedure Office of the Senate has responded very positively to requests for seminars for SES officers, the most senior officers of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I highlight the two points of anxiety that the President of the Senate has put before us today. He has said that there has been a positive response to make sure that the law of the land is understood throughout the Commonwealth Public Service. But it would be actually enhanced if we saw some concrete action from, in particular, two pivotal decision areas: the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Public Service Commission.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reinforce the way the President of the Senate has highlighted those two groups in the hope that this will come before the head of the Public Service Commission and the Secretary to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet so that there is a concrete response similar in action&mdash;not just in words, not just in assent&mdash;to that which has been set out in the other paragraphs of the response of the President of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with the general thought&mdash;I hope it is not too self-indulgent&mdash;that one of the real safety nets, one of the positive guarantees of civil rights in this country, is the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges in so far as it can guarantee, through its investigations and conclusions and recommendations to the Senate, all of which in some 40-odd reports have been accepted by the Senate, that there is no transgression of the civil rights that come within our purview under the law of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a constant brief to, by occasional reports, recommend to the Senate whether there are ways of improving guarantees of the civil rights of Australians and the right of every Australian to open representation and open access to this parliament. May this be a very valuable element of the parliament that we promote by example to other countries so that we might see mature, guaranteed civil rights of this kind not only in Australia but in other countries. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Quorum formed)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I endorse Senator Teague's comments on the response to the 42nd report of the Committee of Privileges. I also endorse the measures which have been taken in relation to the report, which dealt with the possible adverse treatment of a witness before the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities and resulted in the President's response now before the Senate. Before looking at those measures in more detail, I will refer to Australia's system of government, which might give the Senate some idea as to why this is such an important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look back to the formation of the federation. Australia borrowed several constitutional systems to form its government arrangements, the centrepiece of which was a bicameral legislature for our parliamentary system. The principles shaping it are representative democracy and responsible government. Essential to it is the parliamentary committee system. If we are to be representative of the people of Australia, and if we are to be responsible government, then contained in our actions must be open government and accountability. In any democracy the people must be informed and must make an informed choice when, periodically, they choose who will govern them. Through our parliamentary committees the people of Australia have such representation and power exercised on their behalf.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, we have seen the power of the Senate and its committees questioned, and this has been canvassed at great length in the press. In most parliamentary committees the witnesses are public servants or&mdash;at the least&mdash;ministers, who in turn are advised by public servants. Without going into detail, I note that in the case of the 42nd report of the privileges committee the Senate endorsed a finding of contempt by that committee relating to two senior public servants who had charged a junior officer of the same organisation with misconduct because he had given evidence to a parliamentary committee. That is at the very root of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has recognised the possible problem in relation to this matter and has issued guidelines for official witnesses appearing before parliamentary committees and related matters. Unfortunately, that does not seem to have filtered through the Public Service. I believe that the measures mentioned in the President's report are therefore essential in briefing members of the Public Service in relation to their role when appearing before Senate committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Deputy Clerk of the Senate, Anne Lynch, touched on this problem in her article entitled `Straw men and bogeymen: Public Service accountability to parliamentary committees'. I was interested to note that the Department of the Senate has been conducting a number of seminars for middle level public servants. Page 1 of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At virtually every seminar at which the role of parliamentary committees is discussed terrified participants ask the question: "What if I answer a question in the way my senior officers or my ministers do not like?" The next question is invariably: "What happens if I am browbeaten by Senators seeking information?" Obviously, their perception is that they are between the devil and the deep blue sea, with no protection either from a predatory committee or from a vengeful minister or senior officer.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that that highlights the problem we have had to date in relation to public officials appearing before parliamentary committees. It is most unfortunate that they have such an attitude.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No sanction should be visited upon any official conducting his or her duty when appearing before a parliamentary committee, which is, after all, an essential tool in the exercise of democracy in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in her article, the Deputy Clerk of the Senate summarised succinctly the dilemma facing public servants. Page 4 of the article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, the obligation of public servants is two-fold: to provide information and advice to ministers, with accountability for the implementation of policy; and to perform precisely the same function in respect of the parliament. The only constraints on this function are those imposed by the parliament itself, whether through legislation, for example, secrecy provisions specifically binding the parliament, or through self-denying ordinances such as the Senate privilege resolutions, which bind committees in what they may require of public servants, and the government guidelines for official witnesses before parliamentary committees.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a neat summary of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at the article and recent events, one can see that there has been a great deal of vindication of the action that has been taken as outlined in the President's report. The 46th report of the Committee of Privileges deals with false or misleading information given to Estimates Committee E, popularly known as the diesel fuel rebate reference. At page 12 of that report the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The responsibilities of public servants directly answering questions by members of Senate committees are clear: officers are required to answer fully and honestly all questions which are asked of them, to ensure that Senators are not misled by the provision of incomplete information . . . This duty is limited by the constraints imposed on committees by Senate Privilege Resolution 1(16), which provides that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An officer of a department of the Commonwealth or of a State shall not be asked to give opinions on matters of policy, and shall be given reasonable opportunity to refer questions asked of the officer to superior officers or to a Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, one can draw a parallel between that situation and the one which is outlined in the 42nd report of the Committee of Privileges. At page 13 of its report the Committee of Privileges said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee endorses the Minister's action in rebuking the officers and places on record its own serious concern at their conduct, in placing both the Minister and the Estimates Committee in the position of giving and receiving information which would shortly be known to be false.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a most serious situation, because parliamentary committees should not act upon information which is either incomplete or false. To that extent, I submit to the Senate that members of the Public Service have a most important duty and a most important role when either appearing before such committees or assisting their ministers who appear before such committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the process of the estimates committees to see just how important that information is, because it is, after all, what the Senate committees and the public rely on. When Senate committee members convene to hear evidence, they hear it on behalf of the people of Australia, who elected them. They are unable to make informed decisions or draw valid inferences if they are labouring under evidence which is incorrect or incomplete. Therefore, the system of government that I mentioned will quickly fracture and decay if the role of parliamentary committees is not upheld and, in particular, if the duties of public officials before them are not outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, in the inquiry conducted by the Senate Select Committee on Certain Aspects of Foreign Ownership Decisions in the Print Media, we saw a situation where various public servants and former public servants refused to provide information or documentation to that committee. That has achieved a great deal of public interest and publicity. In a recent article Padraic McGuinness argued that this dilemma is much more important than other controversies raging across the country. In a recent article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> he stated that this goes to the very function of responsible government. Indeed it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this very moment, questions are being asked as to the power of parliamentary committees and the power of the Senate. These are essential questions which need to be answered for the sake of democracy in this country. We will be unable to function much further either efficiently or democratically if we do not answer these questions. In so doing, we would be negligent not to keep our Public Service informed as to its role and duty when it performs its most important function of appearing before such committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at the President's response, I am pleased to see that, following the recommendation adopted by the Senate on 21 October last year, a number of actions have been implemented. I noticed the various seminars that have been attended by a number of the senators involved with the privileges committee. I can only applaud such action and congratulate them for their efforts in that regard. After all, we cannot expect much from our Public Service if we do not tell it what is expected of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By enumerating guidelines for public officials appearing before such parliamentary committees, we are covering only the first half of the problem. The second half of the problem is to make sure that it is understood and that it will be followed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I, for my part, would be only too pleased and privileged to participate in any further action in relation to the dissemination and briefing of such information to the members of our Public Service. I can say only that I believe that, whilst we jealously guard the role of parliamentary committees and recognise the most essential tasks that they carry out in providing information to the people of Australia, there is a future to a system of government in this country which I believe is one of the best in the world, and the parliamentary committee system forms part of that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I think this is the first report of the Auditor-General since the government announced that it was going to at least consider the Auditor-General being made directly responsible to the parliament in response to an arrangement made with the Australian Democrats. We would be much happier if that arrangement to have the Auditor-General responsible to the parliament rather than to the government was not simply under consideration. We would have hoped there was total commitment to that because, unfortunately, the Auditor-General has been subjected to non-stop attack by this government, not least as a result of the ALP's role as its landlord. The Auditor-General is, quite frankly, being ripped-off in an incredible way by the landlord that it did not know it had&mdash;a sort of Clayton's landlord; the landlord you have when you do not know you have one&mdash;because there was a front put in so that Auditor-General's was not aware of who its landlord really was. I hope that matter will be resolved fairly soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a policy of consistent attack on the Auditor-General, a freezing of his funds, and as a consequence the Auditor-General believes he is unable to do the job which he believes should be done by the Australian National Audit Office. We have seen examples of that kind of campaign spreading a little wider. I noticed a press article just a few weeks ago suggesting that the private sector auditors ought to come in and do the audits of governmental instrumentalities. The point being made&mdash;curiously enough, I might say&mdash;is that the Auditor-General cannot claim the credit for latching onto the sports rorts because all he did was see what I had been doing in Senate estimates committees and as a result he looked into them. It is exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Auditor-General is there gives an added dimension and depth to the benefits that emerge from Senate estimates committees. The government might trample all over us and take no notice of anything we point out, but the Auditor-General is there to ensure that the important matters brought up by opposition senators in Senate estimates committees are properly examined if they merit that kind of examination. I am very grateful for the Auditor-General's devotion to duty in the face of consistent attacks from this government for the fearless way he has done what is no more than his duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem to me an extraordinary situation for anyone to suggest that private sector auditors should be brought in to do the Auditor-General's job with government instrumentalities if we recognise one of the problems that emerges in private sector auditing&mdash;and I am not being critical of any individual auditors. That problem is that while auditors in the private sector are directly responsible to the shareholders, it is the directors who recommend their appointment. I am not aware of any situation in which members of a company at an annual general meeting have overridden that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if one had this situation in the government the problem would be that an auditor doing a major audit, like a government instrumentality, may be under a great deal of pressure to in fact maintain that job. In other words, if there are pressures brought on him by a government instrumentality that might involve the auditor being pressured to see things in the way of the instrumentality rather than in the way the auditor would rather see them, then obviously the threat of the loss of that audit job would be a major problem for the auditor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This kind of conflict does not emerge in the private sector because it would be disastrous for a major company if a major auditor was `sacked' because he would not bend to the will of the directors, and no doubt the marketplace would deal with that company appropriately. There is no marketplace for this penalty, or punishment if you like&mdash;this oversight&mdash;to be available in the public sector, apart from the parliament itself. It would be quite improper for an auditing group that had a vested interest in maintaining that audit to be put in the terrible position by government of being pressured to do what the government wants. We have seen the way the Auditor-General has resisted that sort of pressure from this government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I was, in fact, making those comments by way of a preliminary discussion, because, as I pointed out at the beginning of my remarks, this is the first report since the government gave the undertaking that it would at least examine the serious need to have the Auditor-General directly responsible to the parliament rather than to the government itself. There is no doubt, as Senator O'Chee says, however, that this is only a preliminary study of the role and administration of this program because the Auditor-General did not proceed to a full efficiency audit. One of the reasons for his not proceeding with that, of course, is that the mandate of the audit office does not enable it to audit the operations of state government bodies, except in very restrictive circumstances. Nonetheless, the restraints put upon the audit office by lack of funding are a key factor in limiting the many activities the Auditor-General would like to pursue, as the Auditor-General himself has said many times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Industry Extension Service, which is the subject of this audit report&mdash;a project audit&mdash;is a joint Commonwealth-state and territories program which aims to assist firms to become more internationally competitive. The major responsibilities of the Commonwealth are to coordinate and monitor the system&mdash;and, I might say, to put in a fair amount of money as well. These functions are carried out by the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Commonwealth expenditure on the program in 1992-93 was $16 million. While the Commonwealth puts up a lot of the money, the states have primary responsibility for the delivery of the program to clients. The report of the audit office states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian National Audit Office has a preliminary study of the role of DITARD in the administration of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preliminary study indicated that the department plays a significant part in coordinating the activities of the NIES&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the National Industry Extension Service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">network and has performed its role in an essentially sound manner.</PARA>
<PARA>It is very pleasant to see the Auditor-General being able to report that a body has conducted itself in an essentially sound manner. Despite what may be the impression from a lot of publicity, the great bulk of governmental bodies are conducted in an essentially sound manner. But the Auditor-General, ever alert, has found many instances where there have been major problems&mdash;such as the sports rorts affair&mdash;that have to be brought to the attention of the parliament and given the backing of the objectivity of the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, even though the program basically gets a clean bill of health, the audit office considers in this case that the extent to which the program is effective in achieving its primary objective of making firms internationally competitive needs to be more clearly established. There is no doubt that there is a bipartisan approach within this parliament about the need for Australia to be more internationally competitive and for firms to be assisted, where appropriate, in achieving that kind of objective. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular, it is considered that a greater priority should be given to tracking the progress of firms that have participated in the program.</PARA>
<PARA>It is just like the sports rorts affairs. We discovered in a Senate estimates committee the other day that there had been no really effective study of the effectiveness of that program. Once again, we see that there is a need to track the progress of firms that have participated in the program. We were told at the Senate estimates committee which dealt with sport rorts that successful applicants had not been tracked to see what had happened; in fact, it had not even been established whether the applications that were successful were better than the applications that were not successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Auditor-General is quite right adopting the same sort of approach here. The report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The appropriateness of using subsidised consultancies as the means of assisting the majority of clients should also be reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA>I will deal with that in a minute. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was found that the NIES Branch of DITARD had not gained assurance that all of the States applied procedures in administering subsidies that minimise the risk of fraud and protect the integrity of their respective subsidy approval and payment systems. A review of their procedures has been recommended.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a proper recommendation. One of the problems is that taxpayers' money from the federal stream is disbursed by the states. So, obviously, there has to be proper supervision to ensure that the risk of fraud does not become too great. Going into a little detail, the Auditor-General's report says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The States have primary responsibility for the delivery of NIES services to firms. However, the Commonwealth provides some funding to each State and  . . . some direction on how the funds are used. The practice of using the major proportion of NIES funds to subsidise consultancies as a means of delivering extension services appears to have evolved, rather than to have been specifically and formally decided at the national level. It is acknowledged that NIES provides some services such as networking and quality assurance which assist firms other than through individual subsidised consultancies, but these remain in the minority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rigorous consideration of the effectiveness or otherwise of the program should entail review of the appropriateness of current delivery methods and the feasibility of any alternatives that may have wide application. It would be appropriate for the department to encourage a regular review. In particular, it should promote examination of whether subsidised consultancies for the majority of clients is cost effective and the most appropriate means of meeting the objectives of the program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may also be appropriate to examine the relative merits and cost effectiveness of the various subsidy structures used by the states in the light of how effective existing practices are found to have been. Issues such as whether the level of subsidy should reduce as the firm engages in more NIES services could also be given further consideration.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General notes that the issue of what constitutes adequate evidence that firms have paid a consultant's fee in full before claiming payment of a subsidy should also be included for review. That seems to be a vital requirement and it is a matter of some concern that the Auditor-General is apparently not satisfied on that level. The audit office understands that there is no present indication that manipulation of payments is occurring but considers that investigating the practicality of a procedure which could provide better control would be prudent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally&mdash;this is a matter that is certainly close to my heart&mdash;the Auditor-General looks into the matter of assistance to small firms. This program is not simply aimed at people with big export potential but aimed at small firms where I believe there is an incredible future for large export earnings to develop if given the right and enthusiastic support by government and others in this area. In the course of the preliminary study, the view was put to the audit office that subsidised consultancies may not be the best way that the program can assist small firms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern was that some small firms may be encouraged to undertake relatively expensive consultancies which may produce a weighty report that addresses longer term issues beyond the firm's most pressing needs for survival in the short to medium term. It was felt that the executives of such firms might find a report and its recommendations overwhelming, put it aside and direct their attention back to shorter term needs. In other words, the whole point of the program could well be missed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General says it was suggested that some such firms would derive greater benefit if a form of mentoring was provided with expertise being made available on a periodic basis, such as monthly, to give practical assistance in overcoming problems and impediments to international competitiveness. The audit office understands that NIES does provide assistance through methods other than individual subsidised consultancies and that small firms are encouraged to participate in activities such as networking and group quality assurance programs. The department advised, however, that it was sensitive to the needs of smaller firms, pointing out that several NIES products had been modified for</PARA>
<PARA>easier, less costly use by smaller clients and that a number of self-help manuals for small enterprises had been developed. Commonwealth NIES also advised that, following the recent restructure of the department, it was now part of the broader business improvement programs branch, which seeks to address development of firms of all sizes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in conclusion that I hope small businesses that are keen on developing export markets will in fact be looking into this program. There is a fair amount of Commonwealth money in it. Maybe it is not enough in some people's view, but there was something like $16 million in 1992-93.
