<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the lunch break yesterday, I was speaking on this matter of registration of senators' interests. I indicated that I have no objection to disclosing what little assets I have. In fact, I have already done that in the past. Like Senator Panizza and others on this side who have been members of local authorities, we have already done that. We have disclosed, to anyone who was interested to look, what our assets and interests were in our role in local government. I have no particular concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern I do have with this motion by the Labor Party is that it is not a genuine attempt to disclose senators' interests. Senator Baume has mentioned on many occasions, and again today in a notice of motion, just how the Labor Party flouts these rules. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) cannot even fill in the form correctly. It will be interesting to see whether there is any response to Senator Baume's notice of motion this morning in which he asked whether the Prime Minister complied with the guidelines in disclosing his interests as required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is really just a stunt by the Labor Party. Members of the Labor Party are not genuine about disclosure of interests. I say this because I understand there was very little or no consultation with the Liberal Party on the form that the proposed resolution should take. One would think that if there were any genuine interest by the Labor Party in proper disclosure, it would have been done in a bipartisan way. There would have been some input from all parties&mdash;particularly the majority party in this chamber, the party that is favoured by a majority of Australians. One would have thought there might have been some consultation, but there was not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say there is a lack of genuineness in the fact that this motion has been around since 1983 and the government, the Labor Party, has chosen not to bring the motion on. I know some of the sycophants in the press who run around after the Labor Party are saying that it is the Liberal Party that has been delaying it. We have never delayed it. It is a very important matter which requires very intense debate and scrutiny. It is something that we have been debating, but the Labor Party keeps refusing to bring it on. It was only because it was forced to do so, on some other little grubby deal it was doing with one of the minor parties, that we are debating the matter now. The Labor Party is interested in the political point scoring of it, but there is no genuine attempt to disclose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all instances, if we on this side of parliament, the Liberal and National parties, are discussing or debating a matter in which any of us have an interest, we disclose it at the time, and that is the proper disclosure that there should be. Anyone in the chamber or the press gallery, or any member of the public, can understand what assets we have that might conflict with the legislation or the discussion before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During Senator Baume's speech on the motion today, he pointed out that Mr Keating did not disclose that he owed Mr Brown some $4 million, I think it was. I think that figure has since been altered to something else that Senator Baume has ascertained. How can we think that these rules are genuine when the Prime Minister cannot disclose those interests? At the time Mr Keating obtained a loan from the Commonwealth Bank he was either Treasurer or Prime Minister. It would be interesting to know whether the Prime Minister discloses his interests in the Commonwealth Bank or his loan dealings with the Commonwealth Bank when he makes decisions at the cabinet table on the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank being in the past wholly owned by the Commonwealth government, which is now a major shareholder. There is certainly a lack of genuineness in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I said yesterday that if the Labor Party were serious about disclosure and conflict of interest, why is it not looking at disclosure for members of the press gallery, proprietors of the news media and journalists who report this parliament? I hate to say it, but on many occasions members of the press gallery and journalists have a greater influence on action the government takes than do members of parliament who are not in government. It would seem fair to ask why the Labor Party is not looking at some disclosure for them. I also asked why the Labor Party and the unions are not required to disclose their assets because decisions this government makes every day affect the very large land-holdings of the unions and the very big shareholdings that I know the ALP has in Queensland and, no doubt, elsewhere. I also question why departmental heads are not required to participate in some form of public disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested to see what the Democrats' amendment in relation to spouses is. There are fairly different proposals around. The government's proposal is that the assets of de facto spouses have to be disclosed if they are known. I want someone to tell me what a de facto spouse is. It seems to me to be a term which you can interpret as you want. If you are married, in a regular marriage, we know who your spouse is. But these days there are a number of people in the community who have relationships. Are they de facto spousal relationships? I understand that the current politically correct term used by the Labor Party for a husband, wife or the person you are closely associated with is `partner'. They are no longer a spouse but a `partner'. I wonder whether the de facto spouse spoken about in the Labor Party's proposal means partner. Just what does it mean? It might be interesting to hear some debate on that. I could not speak in this debate without referring to the sanctimonious claptrap that Senator Cook spoke on 19 August 1993, when this motion was first debated. Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What have we got to hide in opposing this?</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, we are not particularly opposing the disclosure; we are opposing the form of it. He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any case, from the Labor side, we do not want to hide anything;</PARA>
<PARA>This was at the time when Mr Keating, the Labor Party's  leader, was hiding the extent of his interest. Senator Cook compounded that stupidity by later on the same day saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Prime Minister also declares his interests, members on the other side are aware that the Prime Minister has an interest in a piggery.</PARA>
<PARA>We did not know much about that until Senator Baume and others started investigating that matter. Since August 1993 we have known a lot more about the piggery but not, of course, because of anything the Prime Minister has told us; we know simply because Senator Baume, very skilfully and persistently, has gone through and exposed for the Australian public the Prime Minister's huge conflict of interest. For Senator Cook to suggest that the Prime Minister is the fountain of all virtue in disclosure is absolutely ridiculous. I find that quite amazing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the sensitivity of the Democrats to all this. In the press they have been blamed, along with us, for delaying this matter. I do not think they have; they are not in charge of the program of the Senate. It is a matter for the Labor Party, for the government of the day, to bring this motion on as and when required. The Labor Party has been messing around with this since 1983 simply because it did not want proper debate on and scrutiny of it. It knew in debate we would point out just how futile and how shallow these rules are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just have a look at some of the rules to see how some of the Labor Party members have complied with them in the registers of interests they have lodged. Senators are supposed to declare shareholdings in public and private companies, including the name of the company or companies. I see that certain senators apparently trade in shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate Senator Colston on the way he filled in his form. I think he did so very truthfully and honestly. He has indicated that he has some shares in a private company, no doubt his own family company, and he then indicated that that family company has shares in a number of major listed public companies. It was very good of Senator Colston to disclose that. Under the rules he did not have to; all he had to do was say, `Yes, I have some shares in my private family company'. He did not have to disclose all the major companies he has shares in. From looking at this register I suspect that he invests in Australia, and good for Senator Colston. It looks as though he has a number of shares in different public companies. I would say he probably trades in them, and that is good to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when does Senator Colston update that information? If he sold some of those shares and bought some more, as would a share trader, and particularly if he is doing it every day as a share trader would&mdash;and I know some parliamentarians who are share traders&mdash;apparently he would have to disclose the changes in his shareholdings every day as he bought and sold shares. In itself that suggests how stupid these rules are and how ineffective they will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns's return is another matter of interest. Senator Bryant Burns has completed his return, as he is required to do, and that is beaut, but it is handwritten and his handwriting can hardly be read. So what is the point of a return that no-one can read? Senator Burns has complied with the rules&mdash;good for him&mdash;but anyone reading this to discover whether he has a conflict of interest would not be able to understand it because the handwriting makes it very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that Senator Schacht, the small business minister, when filling in his form did not even understand the difference between a proprietary company and a public company. That is particularly interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that former Senator Sibraa disclosed that he had shares in Fendran Pty Ltd. There is no indication as to what Fendran does, as to whether it owns any assets, any land, any piggeries or any shares. There is nothing about that, so this disclosure is absolutely futile and valueless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to Senator Bolkus's disclosure, I understand that Senator Bolkus had a very high profile and public marriage just recently. Congratulations to him on that, but his form does not seem to disclose that he has a wife. Obviously this was completed before he was married.

He is supposed to say what the partnership does and what it is about. I quote from the rules indicating he has to disclose any interests in relation to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . partnerships, indicating the nature of the interests and the activities of the partnership . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus, a senior minister in this government, has not complied with this rule. He has not done it. What is being done about his not completing the form properly? Nothing, I suspect. Senator Bolkus has not disclosed anything. He could own the land that this parliament sits on, for all we know&mdash;that partnership might, for all we know&mdash;but it is not disclosed. That is why I say that this whole business is so futile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I looked at Senator Beahan's return. He has disclosed that he has an overdraft on a trading account. A trading account is used in a business, but his form does not disclose his owning or having any interest in any business. What is happening there? He has a trading account for a business but no business. Again, I do not care too much about that, but it shows just how futile this whole set of rules is. I could go on all day with similar examples. I make it quite clear that I am not accusing any of the members of the Labor Party of deliberately misleading the Senate, but I am pointing out that these rules mean absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I fill in my form I will disclose, as best I can, the assets I have. I have&mdash;and have had for many years; since long before I ever thought of coming to this place&mdash;a family trust, the trustee of which is a private company in which my wife and I own a couple of $1 shares. According to these rules, I only have to disclose that I have a couple of $1 shares in this private family company; I do not have to say that it owns assets here and assets there and has a few shares&mdash;but I will. Whenever I speak in this chamber on any matter that in any way affects me, my family trust or anything like that, I tell the Senate about my interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate in the Senate on better cities money in Townsville, where this Labor government gave $10 million in a pre-election buy-up, I criticised it&mdash;and I was criticised in my home town. I disclosed that I had property in that area. The government's giving money to that area was good for me&mdash;and I am glad it did it&mdash;but I think it was a wrong expenditure of money. I disclosed my interest at the time. That is the way we should do it; we should disclose these things. The rules before us, put up by the Labor Party, are simply a sham. It is very easy to get out of disclosing interests. People can buy things in the name of their spouse and not have to disclose them. It just makes a mockery of the whole process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that we are also supposed to indicate liabilities, the nature of them and the creditor concerned. In the leading case, Mr Keating's registration of interests, not much about the nature of the liability was shown. We have since heard about the quite unusual arrangement where it is up to the borrower to decide whether to repay the debt to Mr Brown, a former Labor minister and current lobbyist. That detail, of course, was not in Mr Keating's registration of interests. Looking through the register I see that some people have disclosed debts owing. Some have said it is a debt to the bank for the purchase of their house; others have just said it is a debt. So what do we do? These rules do not make any proper disclosure of where conflicts of interest might occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with interest that there is a requirement to disclose any other interest where a conflict of interest with a senator's public duties could foreseeably arise or be seen to arise. On that basis all members of the Labor Party in this parliament should be disclosing that they are members of a party which has leased a premises that it owns to a Commonwealth government organisation at an outrageously high rent&mdash;a rent which will give the Labor Party a slush fund for campaigning at public taxpayers' expense of, I think, $35 million over the next 10 to 20 years. Why has that not been disclosed by members of the Labor Party?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the profits from those sorts of rorts by the government, publicly funded by the taxpayer, that will get this lot opposite elected. Those opposite will use the profits from that company to get elected, to get in here with all the trappings of office, yet none of them have disclosed that. I cannot think of a greater conflict of interest than a political party secretly leasing its premises to a government department at an enormously high rent&mdash;a rent which is far and away in excess of any comparable rents in this town or around Australia. Where was that disclosed in their register of interests?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disclosure rules are not being complied with, and that has always been the concern that we in the Liberal and National parties have had. Labor Party members in this place flout the rules. They do not comply with them; they do not do what they are supposed to do. For that reason, this is a fairly futile exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these rules do come in, if the Senate happens to vote that way, people on this side of the chamber will comply with them. As we do now, as honestly as we are able, we will disclose areas where there might be any conflict. Members of the Labor Party do not do so; they have not done so. Why go through the facade and the farce of bringing these rules forward?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to speak further on this matter but I suspect that some of my colleagues also want to speak on this debate&mdash;a debate that has been considerably shortened by the guillotine applied by the government in conjunction with the Democrats&mdash;so I will not proceed further. I simply reiterate that, if this were a proper disclosure provision, I am sure that the government would have the full and total support of senators on this side of the chamber. These mickey mouse regulations which mean nothing are just a farce, a sop by Labor Party members to pretend that they are interested in accountability. The regulations really mean absolutely nothing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues, in particular Senator Ian Macdonald, in speaking on this debate as to whether the Senate should establish a register of senators' interests. For a number of reasons, to support the proposal as it now stands would be an unwise thing to do. Perhaps the most obvious of those reasons are the top two. Firstly, we run a serious risk of creating a false sense of security in the community. It would be a case of, `We don't have to worry about whether people have a conflict of interests because they have had to establish their interests in this register; they have had to disclose them. So we don't have to worry'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen in recent debates, as Senator Macdonald indicated, that the register is not drafted so that that is the case. It is not true that we do not have to worry. Any members of the community who bothered to look at the House of Representatives disclosure forms would have no idea of the extent and involvement of Mr Keating's companies in the piggery to be established, no idea of the values involved in loans and in assets and liabilities&mdash;no idea at all. Perhaps the piggery is the classic example of where looking something up in one of these registers is really no good to us at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we wanted to chase it up, we could go to the relevant registers and follow through all the companies and do an enormous amount of digging, which obviously has been done. In that sense, the register gives a clue as to where to go. But why bother to establish a register of interests which, on its face, is clearly useless? We establish a false sense of security in the community that we do not have to worry about people's interests because they are disclosed. That is the first point I make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make&mdash;I think history from time immemorial shows this to be the case&mdash;is that we cannot legislate for honesty. It is just not possible. Those who are minded to be dishonest spend their lives getting around the rules, figuring out how not to do what they ought to do&mdash;in this case how to disguise a financial interest, if that is what they wanted to do, such that on the face of this register they would not have to disclose it. One would not need to be much more than a second year law student to figure out how to do it. That just makes a farce of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we accept the proposition that we cannot legislate for honesty, that people who want to get around it will, we come back to the first point that I made that this is pretty useless. When people think they have some interest&mdash;I say interest there without adding the adjective `financial' because I want to come to that point&mdash;which ought to be disclosed we should rely on them to so disclose it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Plenty of people have a variety of assets or relationships that are well known and they do not bother every time to get up and say, `I have this and I have that and they are inconsequential'. We rely on people to disclose a consequential interest. By and large, I think that happens. If there is a case recently where that has not happened it would have to be Mr Keating's piggery.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take these things quite seriously. In 1987-88 I had responsibility in the shadow ministry for the status of women and, among other things, the Australian Capital Territory. Probably not many people know that a question came up as to whether we should agree that a casino be established here. At that time, my husband, not I, had some shares in a company&mdash;the name of which escapes me&mdash;which owned Federal Hotels, which had an obvious interest in whether or not Canberra should have a casino. At some substantial loss, about which I am constantly reminded by my husband, he sold the shares. The loss was in the thousands of dollars, so he still remembers it from 1988. We sold the shares because I did not want to be in the position of anyone being able to say, `Look, even though you are not in government, in opposition you can make a difference to these things, whether or not you agree, whether or not you create difficulty'. If a casino had gone through with our support and Federal Hotels had had the opportunity to run it, I would have been very uncomfortable. The sad thing was that only a couple of weeks after the shares were sold I was ditched from the shadow ministry and the decision was not mine anyway. </PARA>

Basically, I regard that story as nobody's business, but I tell honourable senators that story simply to indicate that I take matters of conflict of interest very seriously. If people have a responsible position, they should make sure that they do not have a conflict. I think people should get out of the conflict rather than simply declaring it. I think declaring it is going halfway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, there may be occasions when we could not be expected to dispose of a conflict of interest. For example, a family might come from a long line of families in the pastoral industry and they may be holding property which is run by a manager. When dealing with a bill which relates to, for example, disposal of wool, I do not think we could expect someone to dispose of that interest. That would clearly be ridiculous. I presume that no-one here would expect that. A declaration of that interest would be satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just raise the point of these shares in the company, whatever its name, that held Federal Hotels: where it is reasonable to dispose of the interest, it should be disposed of. I say `the interest'. I made the point before that it is not just financial interest. That is another thing which is wrong with these sorts of things: people do not only vote in accordance with their decision as to what is substantively the best way to go simply because of financial interest. Day after day I see people on the other side of the chamber who, because of factional arrangements, have worked out in what particular way they are going to vote. The party on the opposite side of the chamber does not give people the opportunity to vote according to their consciences in a way different from their party view. They all have to sit over there&mdash;I do not say like dummies. That is the course they have chosen: collective responsibility for a collective decision. But individually they are not entitled to vote in a different way, and I am. </PARA>

We, on this side, thought that minister was getting a better run in the media than the rest of the guys on the frontbench, and we did not think it was fair.

Why could we not include putative spouses? If any men have fathered children, we would like to know about the interests of the women by whom they have fathered their children. They are putative spouses. At law a woman is entitled to a portion of the assets of the father of her children. For the purposes of a legal distribution of assets, the woman is as entitled as a spouse or a de facto spouse. So what about putative spouses?

Allegiances of friendships might occasion someone to not bother to cross the floor or to not bother to make the argument and run dead on a particular issue because one of that person's mates is owed a favour and wants this particular issue to go this way or that way. The point I make about people on the other side not being able to cross the floor only exemplifies, in their case, how pointless it is in some instances to disclose an interest. Even if the interest is disclosed, they are not entitled to vote differently on an issue anyway. So what are we worried about?</PARA>

We have to disclose where the liabilities are but, as I understand it, not exactly how much they are. One has Buckley's of going to a bank and finding out what the degree of someone's indebtedness is. The hope is that, because people disclose that they have some sort of liability, it does not matter how big the liability is because their assets will reflect that. However, a simpleton's mind does not appreciate that their assets may well not reflect the reason for the debt at all and, therefore, not disclose what the genuine interest is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have got a very small unit in Parkside in Adelaide. I have a first mortgage over a portion of that unit, which I am reminded of every month when I look at the bank statement. I have got a unit at Kingston. Finally, I am pleased to say that Westpac does not have an interest in that after 10 years; it seemed interminable. My husband and I have interests in two properties in the south-east of South Australia. With one of them, if I were simply to comply with this form, those opposite would understand what the interest was because we have got one undivided fifth share of some land. Anyone who saw where that was&mdash;the south-east&mdash;would assume it had some rural association. We, as husband and wife, are partners in a pastoral company. The title is `such and such a pastoral company', so it is quite clear on the face of it what that interest is. The pastoral company owns the stock, plant and equipment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other property is owned through a different legal structure. A second- or third-year law student would be able to figure out ways to get around this register. That comes back to the original point, and the most important point I made, that one cannot legislate for people to be honest. That other property is owned in this way: shares in a company, which is itself a trustee of a unit trust, and holdings of units in the unit trust. People have got Buckley's of ascertaining what that interest is. I think that highlights just how futile this register is. The crucial point is that someone who wants to get around it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have to fill in quite a bit under liabilities. Apart from the first mortgage over the small property in Parkside in Adelaide, the other liabilities are all with Westpac. I would be happy to fill that in. I am somewhat concerned as well, especially for the women in parliament, about the nature of the financial relationships they have with their spouses and what impact this might have. It is a social fact of our culture that, by and large, women do not hold the assets. So for the men in parliament to have to declare what they know about the assets of their spouses does not really mean much because, by and large, the women in this country still do not hold the assets; that is just a cultural and social fact. I believe that, pleasantly, it is changing. But, nonetheless, more often than not it is the case in any family unit that where assets are held individually more are held by the husband than by the wife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, when we ask the women in parliament to disclose what they know about the interests of their spouses, necessarily they are being asked to disclose more. I would argue that what those opposite are doing is creating a disincentive for the male spouses to continue to enter into joint arrangements with their parliamentarian wives because the consequences necessarily are that that interest might need to be disclosed. It might not be an interest that can in any way be disguised and, for quite good and proper commercial reasons, the spouse might want them to be kept under wraps until a deal is finished, or whatever. One can easily foresee that happening if the assets of one's spouse change by nature of that person's interest and work and where that person is engaged in making a profit by virtue of exchanging large assets and turning them over regularly. This situation does create a difficulty. It does not create a difficulty for male spouses, but I think it potentially could create quite a significant difficulty for female spouses. </PARA>

If there are any other Labor senators wanting to make a contribution, I would be interested to hear what they say as to how we deal with people who have decided not to be honest.

I have an apprehension about that, because basically what it is saying is that it thinks there are lots of people here now who are not honest.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are debating a very important issue today. It is about the declaration of interests of senators, people who are elected to the parliament of Australia to represent the interests of the people of Australia. It is something that I personally believe is long overdue, although I would agree with some of the earlier speakers that the forms in which the declarations are made do need to have some work done on them. I am heartened to note that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), in moving this motion yesterday, indicated that the committee of senators' interests which is to be set up following the passage of this motion will look at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have taken note of some of the comments made by previous speakers from the other side and I do believe there are areas where the form could be tightened up. I would hope that when the committee is established it will take note on a non-partisan basis of some of the comments that were made by speakers opposite&mdash;and, indeed, from this side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleagues on this side of the chamber, I too completed the form on a voluntary basis&mdash;there was no compulsion to complete the form and to table it in the chamber. But I felt it was a great intrusion into the private affairs&mdash;not necessarily of myself because I did not have a problem with completing the form&mdash;of others who have no connection with this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, on the form that I completed and lodged&mdash;I have since amended that form, although I am not sure which one is in the possession of the people opposite who have a record of those forms&mdash;I had to state that I had an interest in the former family home that I occupied with my former wife. Clearly from that there is no conflict of interest in my part ownership or my former wife's part ownership of that home with anything that will be debated in this chamber. From Jean's point of view, it is an intrusion into her affairs. Certainly, I should be in a position to make declarations of that nature, but I do not see why a former spouse with a financial interest with the other former spouse should be subject to the sort of public scrutiny which we volunteered for on the last occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone said that it could be carried on even further&mdash;she spoke about putative spouses. Again, that is something that a committee on senators' interests ought to look at in the future with a view to tightening it up somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much was made during the debate of certain financial interests held by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I do not think there is a need to say very much more; it is on the record&mdash;page after page of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. In fact, some of the comments are also of interest to one of our courts in Australia, but I will not say any more about that. The form, though, does need to be tightened up. It does not cover the situation where an honourable senator might seek to present his or her views through the newspapers of this country using an assumed name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We might say that that would never happen in a place such as this with 76 senators elected to represent the people. But, unfortunately, it has happened in the past. One of our senators made contributions to the newspapers of this country under a pseudonym. That was not entirely honest but it again addresses, and is linked with, some of the matters about which Senator Vanstone spoke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone went on at some length about when she was on the front bench in 1989, I think it was. At that time her husband had an interest in a hotel chain that was bidding for the casino licence in Canberra. Her husband lost some money because the shares were disposed of&mdash;an honourable thing to do. I do not think the form, in its current form, would compel any individual in a similar circumstance to that of Senator Vanstone to do something similar in the future&mdash;to sell shares or interests in a company and make a loss on it. Senator Vanstone is to be commended for doing what she did at the time. I wonder how many of her colleagues on the opposition front bench are following the example. </PARA>

I was making the point that there is, by dint of a government majority, such as a register in the House of Representatives, which is open for anyone to inspect. Anyone from the press gallery, anyone from the opposition or the government, and anyone from the public&mdash;any elector of an electorate&mdash;can inspect the financial interests of members.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . but the Senate condemns the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for filing a grossly misleading declaration of interests, and calls on him to table in the Parliament a full and proper account of his beneficial ownership of substantial assets and liabilities in order for the public to be able to judge the extent of his potential conflicts of interest.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook spoke for half an hour the first time round. He should not be permitted to speak on the same subject for another half hour. If he wants to speak about Mr Keating filing a grossly misleading declaration of interests then that is part of the debate on the amendment. But he should not be permitted to have another half hour&mdash;guillotined time, I might add&mdash;because it stops us from being allowed to speak, and I guess that is what Senator Cook is all about.

But I make the point that any junior person with a nodding acquaintance of the rules of the debate would make, and that is: the amendment is an amendment to a substantive motion, and the terms of an amendment to a substantive motion cannot be considered without considering how it would change that motion and the effect on the motion. Therefore, it is entirely relevant to talk about both the motion and the amendment because we are being asked to vote on whether we support that amendment or whether we do not support it but support the substantive motion.

It should fail on the basis that the Prime Minister has declared his interests on the public record; they are open for inspection. His interests, as far as his part shareholding in a piggery is concerned, are a matter of public notoriety&mdash;they are a matter of public debate.

The Australian community has a right to know what the pecuniary interests of all elected members of parliament are. In the case of the Senate they do not. That is not because of what the government wants. The government has tried to move this and has not succeeded in getting it carried in this chamber.

The government is trying to get bits of paper on the public record so that it can say that there is disclosure of members' and senators' interests. But, having looked through them, it is very clear that there is no disclosure of members' and senators' interests for a large number of people; the disclosure is quite meaningless. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the amendment moved by Senator Baume, and I also take the opportunity to foreshadow amendments which I have circulated and which I do not think I can strictly move until the amendment of Senator Baume is disposed of. Senator Baume's amendment goes to the heart of this matter, because it is based on the fact that the disclosure that has been made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his statement in the other place is not only misleading but also gives insufficient information upon which any member of the public could make an assessment as to whether there is a conflict of interest, or a potential conflict of interest, between the Prime Minister's personal business interests and his public responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why Senator Baume has moved his amendment which is&mdash;and I remind the Senate, as it was some time ago that it was moved&mdash;to add at the end of the motion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . "but the Senate condemns the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for filing a grossly misleading declaration of interests, and calls on him to table in the parliament a full and proper account of his beneficial ownership of substantial assets and liabilities in order for the public to be able to judge the extent of his potential conflicts of interest".</PARA>
<PARA>It will be interesting to see how the Labor Party and the minority parties in this place vote on that amendment, because, if they do not support it, what it really means is that they endorse a disclosure regime which is ineffective. By doing that they therefore endorse a regime that in effect misleads the public, because it gives the public a false confidence that there is sufficient information on the register for them to be able to make that judgment as to whether there is a conflict of interest. And it is simply not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume's amendment states that the statement of the Prime Minister is misleading. What did the Prime Minister say? On 7 June 1991 he wrote to the Clerk of the House of Representatives in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I advise that on 15 May 1991 my family company, Pleuron Pty Ltd and I made an investment by way of acquisition of shares in Euphron Pty Ltd, a company which has interests in a piggery and a refrigeration fabrication business. The interests acquired by both Pleuron Pty Ltd and me in Euphron Pty Ltd do not constitute a controlling interest in that company, nor do I or any member of my family hold a directorship of that company.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So if that is right, then this statement by the Prime Minister is misleading, and this Senate should recognise that it is misleading. Also, in terms of it being insufficient, it gives no indication of the indebtedness of that company, particularly indebtedness to the Commonwealth Bank which, it has been suggested, at that time was something just under $18 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have a situation where the Treasurer who, at the time of the purchase, was responsible for the Commonwealth Bank, was purchasing a company very significantly indebted to that bank. Was that apparent from the statement that he had tabled in the House of Representatives? No. But without that knowledge the public is not in a position to determine whether or not there is a potential conflict of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also failed to reveal that the companies were also indebted to Mr John Brown, a former minister, to the tune of millions of dollars. What we have here is Mr Brown who now acts as a lobbyist, and a Prime Minister who has interests in a company indebted to Mr Brown. I would have thought that that presents obvious conflicts of interest, but that information&mdash;that indebtedness to Mr Brown&mdash;is not included in the statements lodged by Mr Keating in the other place. What one has to do is search through the various company records to ascertain that information. The minister will say that we would get a hint, because once we were given the company name we would be able to conduct those searches. The point is that members of the public are supposed to have confidence that the register is sufficient in itself for them to be able to see whether there is a potential conflict of interest. It is simply not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister's further indebtedness through his companies to what we understand is the Commonwealth Bank could be anything up to $30 million.

The Prime Minister's example demonstrates the ineffectiveness of the regime that this government is seeking to set up, and the false confidence it raises in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why Senator Baume has moved this amendment. It will give the Senate the opportunity to criticise the Prime Minister for the misleading aspects of his own statement but, perhaps even more importantly, require of him to disclose sufficient information for the public to make a real assessment as to the extent of actual or potential conflicts of interest. I trust that the Senate will support the motion and send a clear message to the Prime Minister that a disclosure regime which is just a sham is insufficient, and that if he seeks to impose it upon the parliament through his will, then he should be prepared to disclose in a meaningful form which achieves the objective which he is claiming of this scheme but which is clearly not achieved by the scheme as it is presented today to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some confusion. We actually support disclosure, and that is why one of our foreshadowed amendments specifically requires senators in debate to disclose interests that might amount to a conflict of interest, and to disclose on a vote in this place. They will make that judgement in each and every circumstance, and each and every circumstance will differ, demonstrating the shortcoming of trying to codify this in the way the government has done&mdash;taking the lowest common denominator, and, in effect, ending up with a form that provides the public with no real information and basis for confidence in the system. The system as it is, is ineffective, and that is one of the two major reasons why we have expressed objection to what the government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major reason is the one stressed by Senator Reid and that is the intrusion into matters of genuine privacy of spouses and</PARA>
<PARA>families. We still have to be convinced that that intrusion into the privacy of those other than members of parliament is warranted. I concede that there has been some improvement in the wording, but it is only a nominal improvement&mdash;the disclosure is now only of interests of which the senator is aware. It still does not address the fundamental question that those who happen to be married to us, or our children, are now going to have their affairs disclosed in circumstances to which they may well object. If the senator does not comply with that under the terms of this regime, the senator, himself or herself, commits a serious contempt of the Senate. We retain those reservations and concerns about this intrusion into the private affairs of spouses and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned one of the amendments that I intend to move after Senator Baume's amendment has been dealt with. The other amendments, which I will run through, have been circulated in the chamber. The first one is that we think it is not appropriate that the committee of senators' interests, which will have the responsibility of overseeing the register, is an appropriate committee to also conduct investigations. We believe that, if investigations of alleged breaches are necessary, they should be conducted by a separate body; we suggest the privileges committee, and I will move an amendment to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also seek to increase the figure in relation to a declaration regarding sponsored travel or hospitality to something that is more realistic, and we propose to increase it to $500. Similarly, we say that gifts that are made should be disclosed, if they are going to be disclosed, when they amount to something in excess of $500. We think that the current figure of $100 is ridiculously low. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fourth amendment is to ensure that the disclosure regime is limited to pecuniary interests. There may well be interests which raise issues of moral conflict, religious beliefs and so forth. As it is at the moment, it is ambiguous. I do not think it was ever intended that that type of interest was to be covered. Therefore, the fourth amendment I propose to move will restrict it to pecuniary interests, which I think is in accordance with the government's objective in any event. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My fifth amendment is the one that I mentioned a little while ago, specifically requiring senators to make declarations at the beginning of a speech and also after a division. I understand, from what the minister told me yesterday, the government will support that, and I am pleased it has come to the party on that and recognises that that is important. My sixth amendment is to define `spouses' to include `de facto spouses'. I will move those amendments after the vote on Senator Baume's amendment. </PARA>

Presumably Senator Beahan is a member of the Labor Party and could well be a member of other organisations. But he did not see fit to fill out the form completely and nor did he see fit to sign it.

I think the issues have been very well canvassed. I simply acknowledge the reality that any system of pecuniary interests registration that we adopt is bound to represent some kind of balance between the public interest in disclosure on the one hand and legitimate claims to privacy on the other. There will always be arguments as to whether the balance has been sufficiently struck one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the contribution we have heard from the opposition side has not been so much directed against the principle of pecuniary interest disclosure, but rather against the alleged inadequacies of the present scheme. I can understand a number of those points. The answer that I would make to that is that those on the opposition side who think that they can design better forms or an approach to this in terms of the actual presentation of data better than the form now proposed will have an opportunity, through their participation in the committee on senators' interests, to have an ongoing input into this process as it evolves over the years ahead. We have quite an open mind as to how best to advance the cause here when it comes to the actual detail&mdash;consistently, of course, with the terms of this motion&mdash;and we will be happy to respond to and discuss suggestions of a detailed kind that might be made to make the system work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we do not have an open mind&mdash;where we have a thoroughly closed mind&mdash;is on the virtues of this particular system being put in place. It is just unconscionable that we have sat here in the Senate since 1986 while the House of Representatives has had its system in place. It is unconscionable that it has taken us something like 11 or 12 hours of debate spread over seven or eight different occasions in those intervening years to finally get to the point that we will get to in the next few minutes of a vote on this matter. It is quite intolerable in terms of any basic commitment to democratic accountability principles that that should be so. It has nothing to do with the management of this place.

I do not propose to say anything further whatsoever on that subject. We will vote accordingly and I would urge the Senate to do so. </PARA>

As to the second proposed amendment, to set a threshold on declarable sponsored travel or hospitality, we initially preferred to set no limit at all on what was disclosable there.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the fourth amendment about limiting the requirement to declare any other interest where a senator's public duties could arise to pecuniary interests only, we think that is excessively narrowing and limiting. We would not wish to limit it in that way. There may well be other non-pecuniary interests which could conceivably give rise to conflict of interest and be against the public interest as a result. We believe the system will be better for allowing such interest to be declared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the requirement for honourable senators to declare their interests in the course of debate, this is an amendment which we readily accept. I was always puzzled about why it was taken out of the system as applied in the House of Representatives. I am advised that the House of Representatives removed it from its system in 1988 on the recommendation of its own Committee of Members' Interests with the support of not only the government but also the opposition. It was a bipartisan recommendation that came up to remove that particular requirement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee apparently felt that the requirement was so broad it was probably being honoured more regularly in the breach than in the observance, and that it was largely made redundant by the register. Personally, I do not agree with that. I think it is appropriate that interests that conspicuously involve a potential conflict of interest ought to be disclosed at the time that people get to their feet in the chamber. That is the traditional Westminster practice. If we have not been honouring it in the observance as much as we should have in practice in the past I think we should honour it in the future, and maybe this will draw that to people's attention to accept it in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the final amendment on definition of spouse and de facto spouse, what is basically involved here is putting on the register&mdash;not only because of the way the definitions are here drawn&mdash;not only immediate family but also extending the obligation to declare interests on the register to those people who are recipients of travel privileges under the present scheme whereby people in appropriate circumstances can nominate a mother, sister or some other person, maybe not a relative at all, to be the recipient of the travel privilege. That is a system that has evolved to cope with particular personal circumstances that vary from individual to individual. It has been a good system in that context. There is no problem about it. But to take the further step of requiring people who satisfy that criterion to be on the pecuniary interest register generally seems to us to be a case of overkill. Accordingly, we will vote against that. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than having to get to my feet again when it comes to the business of the other remaining debate on the composition of the committee, I will indicate in 30 seconds what our attitude to those amendments will be when they are moved by the opposition.

<PARA>I will speak very briefly to this motion as I do believe that many senators who made a contribution to the previous debate also canvassed their views on the question of the establishment of a committee of senators' interests. This motion formalises the government's proposal to put in place a committee of senators' interests which will mirror the similar committee in the House of Representatives. Its function will be to monitor the operation of the pecuniary interest system and consider any changes to that system which may be proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would regard the provisions relating to the composition of the committee and election of the chair of the committee as being subject to revision in light of the outcome of the inquiry that is currently being undertaken by the procedure committee into the committee system for the Senate. This matter finally puts to rest the issue of pecuniary interests for honourable senators. I think this is an appropriate committee to be established. It will fulfil and perform a very important function. I commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments were foreshadowed a little while ago. The government's motion logically follows the one that the Senate has just carried. Our concerns are not so much in the setting up of the committee but in the composition of the committee. The first amendment, which is on a slightly different matter, omits the reference to a non-existent code of conduct. As I understood Senator Gareth Evans, the government is prepared to support that. So the two amendments in contention are our amendments Nos 2 and 3. They relate to our desire to have this committee reflect the numbers in the chamber rather than the numbers as put in the government's motion and also to the election of the chairman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, the government has stated in its motion that the chairman shall be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. There is no reason why that should be so. In fact, I suggest that, in the circumstances of this particular committee's responsibilities, it is quite inappropriate. Notwithstanding the incredible vote a few minutes ago by the minority parties, by which they refused to admonish the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for lodging a statement of his interests in the House of Representatives which is misleading and also fails to give sufficient information upon which any member of the public can make a judgment as to a potential conflict of interest between public responsibility and personal business interests&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that they voted in effect to sanction the Prime Minister in this way&mdash;it seems to us on this side of the chamber that the Prime Minister's personal failure in the application of the disclosure regime is reason in itself for the government not to be permitted to chair this particular committee. </PARA>

If the Prime Minister himself will not meet the requirements that he sets out and the House of Representatives committee, which through the numbers in the House is under the control of the Labor Party, is not prepared to take action on it, surely that is evidence in itself that this committee being set up by the Senate should not be controlled by the government either in numbers or in its chairmanship.</PARA></TALK.START>

Three sets of approvals are required for the Prime Minister's investment to be viable. In addition, the Prime Minister has a potential for conflict of interest in the fact that he owes $4 1/2 million in a subordinated loan to a lobbyist and in the fact that, when he was Treasurer and when he bought his interest in this company, the Commonwealth Bank was owed more money than the assets of this venture were worth. </PARA>

Then the person really gets into action, signing the cheque and sending it, having bought a bit of time. The declarations of Senator Beahan and Senator Childs are worthless because they forgot to sign them. I put on record the fact that Senator Cook said twice in his speech that the opposition voted down the last motion of this kind. My information from the clerks is that until about 10 minutes ago there has never been a vote on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I open this debate on the Industrial Relations Amendment Bill 1994 by saying that the bill clearly demonstrates the mess which this Labor government is making of industrial relations in Australia. Although the Liberal and National parties will not oppose this amending bill, we do believe it is unnecessary. Because of the way in which the government is mishandling industrial relations, we will be moving a second reading amendment, which I will move at the end of my remarks. It will add at the end of the motion for the second reading of this bill that the Senate, first, deplores the government's incompetent management of the industrial relations portfolio&mdash;incompetence which has again forced it to bring in hasty amendments to the Industrial Relations Act&mdash;and, second, condemns the submissive attitude the government continues to demonstrate towards the ACTU, which is reflected in the commission's unduly expanded responsibility and in the disproportionately large number of senior commission personnel who have been drawn from the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this legislation is unnecessary. It is unnecessary in the first instance because the Industrial Relations Court itself is unnecessary. When the Industrial Relations Court was established in the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, which became an act at the end of last year, it was strongly opposed by the Liberal and National parties. We opposed it for very good reason. The government made absolutely no case at all as to why there was a need to establish a specialist industrial relations court when industrial relations matters could be handled quite adequately by the existing industrial relations division of the Federal Court. No justification or rationale was provided for the establishment of that court.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the establishment and continuing operation of this new court means an unjustified extra cost to taxpayers. There is also grave concern in the community, which has been expressed by the Law Council and others, of the potential lack of independence of this new Industrial Relations Court. The Federal Court, with its industrial relations division, has the absolute independence that any court ought to have. But with the potential for the Industrial Relations Court not to be at arms length from the Industrial Relations Commission, there is the capacity for that very necessary independence that ought to apply to any court to be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also were concerned about the relationship of this court to the government's specific industrial relations program and policies. Again, a body with the status of a court ought not relate to a particular program of a government. Because of the nature of courts, as I have just said, they should have independence, they should be above and beyond any particular policy or program of a government. But that is not the case with the Industrial Relations Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was also the problem of who in fact would constitute this new Industrial Relations Court. Of course, this legislation that we are debating today is the very consequence of the fact that the government itself was uncertain as to who was going to constitute that court when it put the legislation through last year. The Law Council of Australia was opposed to the establishment of this court, and we in fact mirrored the concerns of the Law Council in that debate last year because those concerns were quite legitimate and quite important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, a court which is established in this way, and which relates to a particular segment of a government's policy or program, is obviously vulnerable to a change of government. A government which comes in with a different program in that field, a different set of policies, can abolish such a court. Indeed, the coalition at the time of the debate last year indicated that when in government it would abolish the Industrial Relations Court, which simply highlights the fact that the court is vulnerable to the programs of a particular government. So that court ought not to have been established and therefore this legislation relating to that court is, as I said, unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is unnecessary in the second instance because, if the government really knew what it was doing as far as industrial relations is concerned, it would have included the provisions of this amending bill in that original legislation. After all, we had a very lengthy debate on that legislation in December last year, and the committee stage itself went for three or four days. Winston Crane, my Liberal Senate colleague from Western Australia, and I debated the issues of the legislation, the clauses of that legislation, quite extensively. Indeed, the government introduced and had passed, with the support of the Democrats, 170 amendments to its own bill. So the bill it introduced was not good enough; it had to put through 170 amendments. Yet now it is coming back with further amendments to that legislation. As I said, surely if the government had really known what it was doing it could have included among those 170-odd amendments the amendments that it is proposing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments are clear evidence that the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993, debated and passed at the end of last year, was ill conceived. It is clear that the government had completely failed to properly consider and plan for the operation of that legislation. Of course, we know what that legislation was really about: it was nothing more than a pay-off to the trade union movement for the unbridled support which it gave to the Labor government in the 1993 federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that that legislation which was passed last year had the grand title of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. It was the government's major overhaul of industrial relations in this country. According to the government there would be no more changes necessary to industrial relations legislation in the near future. Yet here we are today, just a few sitting weeks later, debating this amending bill. Do we need any clearer demonstration that the government did not have a clue what it was doing in establishing the Industrial Relations Court?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is not only unnecessary, it is also being introduced into and passed through this parliament with undue haste. The Liberal and National parties have not had adequate opportunity to scrutinise this legislation. It has been given to us for debate this week&mdash;a week in which the House of Representatives is not sitting. There has been no opportunity for the opposition shadow cabinet to meet and consider this legislation. There has been no opportunity for a full meeting of the Liberal and National parliamentary parties&mdash;both the House of Representatives and the Senate&mdash;to meet and consider this legislation. We simply have not had adequate opportunity to consider all the ramifications of the legislation. It is unnecessary haste on the part of this government, again demonstrating its incompetent administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for this haste is that the government has been casting around trying to find someone willing to be president of its unwanted Industrial Relations Court. Eventually, it found Justice Deirdre O'Connor, who is already a judge of the Federal Court of Australia. To move Justice O'Connor from the Federal Court to the new Industrial Relations Court required her agreement to a special deal to take the job. The government now wants to set this deal in cement through this legislation before the new Industrial Relations Act commences operation in a couple of weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this legislation is a special deal for Justice Deirdre O'Connor. The amendments in this legislation allow her to remain a judge of the Federal Court of Australia during her presidency of the Industrial Relations Court and allow her also to be a president for a fixed term. As I said, the first amendment allows her to remain a judge of the Federal Court; the second amendment ensures that her tenure as a judge is not affected by her taking on this presidential role; the third amendment allows her to be appointed for a fixed term; the fourth amendment allows her to receive a presidential allowance on top of the judge's salary. More specifically, clause 3 of the amending legislation amends section 10(1)(a) of the existing act to add the words `is or'. That will therefore allow a person who either is currently a judge or was a judge of a court created by the parliament to become President of the Industrial Relations Court. The current act, as it was drafted and passed at the end of last year, allows only a past judge of the Federal Court to become president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, while this government is changing the act to allow a person who is currently a judge of a court created by this federal parliament to take up the presidency, it has not made the same change for a judge of a state or territory court. It is not giving the same rights to judges of states or territories that it is giving to judges of the Federal Court or other courts created by the federal parliament. This is another example of the centralist attitude of this government and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The original bill in many respects rode roughshod over state jurisdiction on industrial relations and this amending bill simply reinforces the way in which this government gives no consideration to states rights at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 4 of the bill ensures that someone taking up the position of President of the Industrial Relations Court retains full tenure rights, titles and so on of his or her position as a judge of the Federal Court. Clause 5 provides for the appointment of the president for a fixed term of tenure and, as I understand it, it has been agreed that Deirdre O'Connor's tenure will be for five years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth looking at two aspects of clause 5. Firstly, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first President of the Commission appointed after the commencement of this subsection may be appointed for a fixed term . . .</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, this is handmade for Justice Deirdre O'Connor. No-one else will be allowed a fixed term tenure, only the first appointed&mdash;Deirdre O'Connor. Secondly, up until now, presidents have been appointed virtually until they die. Again, to suit one individual, the government is going to change this act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should consider whether acts of parliament ought to be changed at the whim of one person. While we would agree that there ought to be flexibility on agreements&mdash;even agreements for the appointment of the judiciary, which is consistent with the approach the Liberal and National parties adopt&mdash;legislation relating to flexibility in industrial relations and flexibility in employment relations ought to have general application; it ought to apply to everyone. It should not be drafted simply to suit the whim of an individual. That is contrary to natural justice and contrary to the rule of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 ensures that Deirdre O'Connor will retain the salary of a judge. If the president's salary is higher than that, the difference will be made up by the payment of an allowance. It will be interesting to note in that context whether that allowance is to be taxed at the same rate as the equivalent salary or whether it is to be taxed differently because, of course, some allowances are taxed at lower rates and some allowances are not taxed at all. They are particular issues that are raised by the specific amendments that are incorporated in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its indulgence to allow this part of the debate to be concluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the particular issues addressed in the amendment which I will move at the end of my remarks is the unduly expanded responsibility of the Industrial Relations Commission. It relates specifically to what we regard as the nonsense of the commission being given the task of reviewing all awards and enterprise agreements, as it is directed in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993, and the increased role and authority of the commission, albeit with the unions having a de facto veto power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that, very clearly, individual employees and employers ought to be given the right to establish their own enterprise and workplace agreements without the interference of the commission or unions, or anyone else for that matter, unless either the employee or the employer requests such an intervention. So, despite all the trumpeting we had from the government about this legislation at the end of last year, this does not make enterprise agreements any easier to achieve and in fact heads us away from that ideal and back to a system of industrial relations which is much more centralised and much more controlled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last couple of days we have had examples of the way in which it is much more difficult to obtain enterprise agreements. A coalmining operation in central Queensland is becoming the focus of a major national row with regard to the move to 12-hour shifts in the black coal industry. This is despite the fact that the employees at this coalmine and two of the unions involved&mdash;the Automotive, Food and Engineering Union and the Electronic and Plumbing Union&mdash;have supported this move to 12-hour shifts, which would involve workers at the mine working 12-hour shifts on a seven-day on, seven-day off arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason they have come to that agreement is that it will give them more time with their families. A seven-day on, seven-day off roster is acceptable to employees because it will give them more time with their families. A number of them live on the coast and a roster of seven days on and seven days off means that they can work their seven days and then go back to their homes on the coast, some distance away from the mine, and spend time with their families. Yet we find the United Mine Workers Union taking action to prevent this agreement from being put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the International Year of the Family, an industrial relations agreement for family welfare freely entered into by employees and employers with the support of two unions will be opposed by the United Mine Workers Union. In this International Year of the Family, when we ought to be introducing initiatives that will benefit family life, here we find a union taking action to prevent this agreement, which action, if successful, will be detrimental to family life. That is one example of where enterprise agreements are not being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is of CRA, through an enterprise agreement, moving award workers into salaried staff positions. About 80 per cent of its 600-strong work force at Weipa and about 1,300 out of the work force of 1,500 at Hamersley have agreed to this enterprise agreement. It will be opposed by not only the union directly involved but also the ACTU in a campaign to prevent that enterprise agreement coming to fruition. This makes nonsense of this government's claims that the Industrial Relations Act is allowing for a more flexible industrial relations system and better establishment of enterprise agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I wish to make relates again to our amendment&mdash;the disproportionately large number of senior commission personnel who have been drawn from the trade union movement. With those who have been announced as appointees to the Industrial Relations Court we find, apart from Justice Dierdre O'Connor, to whom this legislation relates, two vice-presidents but then nine senior deputy presidents: Elizabeth Evatt, who is currently on leave but is on the Australian Industrial Relations Commission payroll; Mr Keogh, who is a government employee; Alan Boulton, an ACTU legal officer; Joe Riordan, a union official and a minister in the Whitlam Labor government and the New South Wales Labor government; Paul Munro, Federal Secretary of the ACOA, a public service union; Keith Hancock, a Labor-linked academic who is very supportive of the Labor Party's industrial relations policies; Jan Marsh, formerly the ACTU research officer; John McBean from the New South Wales Trades and Labour Council; and one from the employer side of industrial relations, Colin Polites, a solicitor who has acted for employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the six or seven deputy presidents to be appointed, we find Ian Watson, ACTU research officer; Simon Williams, a solicitor who has acted for unions; Jenny Acton, an ACTU industrial officer; Lea Drake, a solicitor who has acted for unions; John Maher, a government servant; and, again one solicitor who has acted for employers, Ann Harrison. Do we need any more evidence than that of the way in which the trade unions are dominating industrial relations in this country and the way in particular in which this new Industrial Relations Court and its associated Industrial Relations Commission are going to operate?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an absolute dominance of former union officials and union representatives on those bodies. That is entirely unsatisfactory if we are to have a fair and balanced conduct of industrial relations in this country. As I have said, it simply indicates the mess into which industrial relations is sinking under this government's administration. Again, it indicates and reinforces the shortcomings and faults that were inherent in the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993. It indicates why this legislation today ought to be unnecessary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it the Military Compensation Bill. On the surface it is an innovation, but in reality it is the current Commonwealth Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, badge-engineered in the vernacular of the times, for the Defence Force. The bill amends the Veterans' Entitlement Act 1986 and the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988. In doing so, it creates the necessary framework for the new military compensation scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 2, clauses 3 to 10 of the bill, establishes the military compensation scheme within the framework of SRCA. This ensures that the military compensation scheme will apply to all members of the Defence Force, including members on future operational service, thus ensuring members on operational service as well as those on hazardous and peacekeeping duties will have the choice of SRCA or the VEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ordinary peacetime members who, on the commencement of the MCS, have an existing entitlement under part IV of the VEA will continue to have the option of SRCA or VEA coverage for that period. Subsequent service will be covered by SRCA only. Peacetime members who do not have an existing entitlement under part IV of the VEA on commencement of the MCS or who enter the ADF after commencement will have only SRCA as modified by the MCS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through section 5(6A), the minister will be able to extend the operation of SRCA beyond members of the ADF by declaring that the act will apply to those who hold honorary rank when they are engaging in activities stemming from that rank, members of philanthropic organisations like the Salvation Army who are serving with the ADF and ex-members of the ADF on discharged resettlement training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the defence force, cadet corps and persons declared under section 5 (6A) will be covered for any injury which arises out of medical treatment provided by the Commonwealth where the injury is an unintended consequence of the treatment. Injured members of the ADF will be able to receive full pay or supplementation up to full pay for the first 45 weeks of compensation, regardless of whether they stay in the ADF or separate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part 3 of this bill amends the Veterans' Entitlement Act to take account of the establishment of the military compensation scheme. These clauses put in place transitional provisions to ensure members on operational service do not have dual coverage under the VEA and SRCA, and a termination date to remove VEA coverage for ordinary peacetime service, except for the period of entitlement already existing at that date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These clauses also ensure that members on hazardous service continue to have the choice of VEA coverage. Those peacetime members who have an existing period of entitlement under part 4 of the VEA will have choice of VEA coverage for that period following the commencement of MCS, and ordinary peacetime members who do not have existing entitlement under the VEA will have coverage only under the modified military compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The military compensation scheme has been discussed for a long while. In 1985, when the VEA was first being debated, the government told the parliament that a military compensation scheme was to be introduced the next year. It has taken almost a decade for the government to deliver. In essence, the amendments ensure that the military compensation scheme will provide the basic level of compensation cover for all types of service: peacetime, peacekeeping, hazardous and operational. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those injured in operational, hazardous or peacekeeping service have a choice between the military compensation scheme and the Veterans' Entitlement Act. Secondly, the military compensation scheme includes all the benefits provided under the SRCA plus cover for the unintended consequences of medical treatment paid for by the Commonwealth, and cover as employees those who are declared to hold honorary rank in the ADF and members of philanthropic organisations who provide service for the ADF. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently the SRCA provides compensation to persons who are injured in the course of their employment by the Commonwealth, while the Veterans' Entitlement Act provides pension entitlements to persons who have suffered a war or defence caused injury or incapacity. Currently, members of the ADF on hazardous, peacekeeping and ordinary peacetime service are covered by both the SRCA and the VEA. Members of the ADF on operational service are covered only by the VEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act covers death or injury at work or during an ordinary recess, illness or disease which was caused or materially contributed to by ADF service, loss or damage to an aid or appliance as a result of work-related accident, and injury sustained during a journey between home and work, and some authorised activities outside of normal work, such as approved sport. The bill lists the actual benefits that will be paid, and I do not propose to repeat them in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will not be opposing this bill, but in no sense does that mean that the bill has our wholehearted support. We are certainly not advocates of this bill, and had we been in government we would have taken a very different path. We were not in government, and the changes we would wish to make to the bill would not, at this stage, receive majority support in the chamber, let alone in the other place. So outright opposition to the bill is quite futile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I therefore propose to make some remarks about this bill. I will start with three points. The first is that we do not need a bill like this&mdash;a separate bill which deals with compensation and rehabilitation and administered by the Department of Defence. The second point I make is that, apart from widening the net and covering more people, this bill brings few, if any, benefits to members of the peacetime ADF beyond what members of the Public Service enjoy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, by so doing, it builds further on the government's aim to make the ADF just another branch of the Public Service, and denies its unique status. It takes away benefits that members of the ADF have enjoyed for over 20 years, and is unambiguously a reduction and lessening of their conditions of service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now expand on those statements. I have thought about this bill a lot, and the more I think about it, the more the force of the argument drives me inexorably to the conclusion that it should be part of the Veterans' Entitlement Act. It logically belongs nowhere else. The DVA has a very long history of caring for the needs of ex-service men and women. Everything is in place for them. While this bill will primarily relate to serving members of the ADF, not veterans, the services that they require could be delivered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The Department of Defence, the authority which will administer these services under this bill, does not have the full resources to deliver the services to the level that veterans and defence force personnel are used to and they will have to be expanded and developed at considerable cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason why this bill could not have been presented as an amendment to the Veterans' Entitlement Act. After all, we have had two separate amendments in the last three months and three amendments in the last 12 months, and I presume we will have more in the next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very good argument to be made to revise and rewrite the Veterans' Entitlement Act, even though it only passed through the parliament in 1986. Its origin and philosophy go back through the various repatriation acts to the First World War. It is far too long and complex, containing many hundreds of pages. Even the plain English version of the bill is complex in itself, and needs to be clarified and reduced. While a new VEA should retain all the benefits in it at present, it should also include compensation for injury, rehabilitation and re-education that the MC bill provides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Veterans' Entitlement Act was born as a consequence of the two greatest military conflicts in history: World War I and World War II. The new bill should be expanded to better accommodate the fact that most members of the ADF today, thankfully, will have seen only peacetime service. Increasingly, a number of those will have only served for a period of five to eight years, not the 20 or more years that will qualify them for a DFRDB or MSBS pension.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My next point is that while people such as cadets, service, welfare and philanthropic personnel and honorary members are covered&mdash;and that is a good thing&mdash;there are few benefits beyond what public servants acquire. The only argument that the government can resort to to defend this position is that, for example, the loss of an arm or a leg is the same for a soldier as it is for a clerk in an office. In one sense that is perfectly true, but it will almost certainly mean the end of a career for a soldier, and at an early age, with low rank and commensurate low pay. It would deny him or her a chosen career in life, while the clerk may well progress to higher things. On that basis, there is a case for a different scale of benefits from those awarded to the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The larger issue here, of course, is the age-old problem of a Labor government being unable to see the difference between the ADF and the Public Service. The Australian Defence Force is trained for wartime operations. Its members do not have unions, awards or overtime and are subject to continuous and strict discipline. They can be required to work 24 hours a day with little or no notice and be sent anywhere. They have to train as realistically as possible to do the violent and dangerous tasks required of them in war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combination of that training and the introduction of this new scheme must lead to a rethink in defence, particularly in two areas&mdash;namely, training standards and the need for preventative actions, and the development of a high standard of incident reporting. The ADF needs to look very closely at the standard of fitness of its personnel. Training injuries are bound to occur during exercises and in any vigorous training session if personnel are not at peak fitness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads to my next point concerning incident reporting. If the new scheme is to work, and to work in favour of the members of the ADF, there will need to be substantial education of the troops to encourage the reporting of incidents. There will need to be a change from the collective view that only major injuries are reported and recorded. A change which recognises that a small, apparently insignificant injury and its cause needs to be recorded, will mean that, down the track, such records will be available when a compensation claim is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said in this chamber many times before that the Australian Defence Force is not a part of the Public Service, and I deplore very much the tendency of this government to make it so. If one accepts that, it therefore follows that members of the Australian Defence Force are entitled to some special considerations from the community which they serve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I would like to make in this area is that for the first time members of the ADF will actually lose some of their benefits. This will happen because the great majority of members will only ever have peacetime service. Therefore, the benefits of the Veterans' Entitlements Act which they at present have will be withdrawn and they will be left only with the military compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Originally, repatriation benefits were only awarded to those who had been on active service in wartime. In 1972, to counter the massive resignation rate under the Whitlam Labor government, coverage was extended under the Repatriation Act to those on peacetime service. In 1986, when the Veterans' Entitlements Act came in, the opposition moved that coverage be maintained until the new Military Compensation Bill was enacted. So, for a variety of reasons, for the last 20 years members of the ADF on peacetime service have been covered by the VEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is accepted that the nature of peacetime training required in the ADF is far removed from the civilian norm, it must also be accepted that it is reasonable to provide a different compensation scheme from that available for civilians. There is, however, a world of difference between peacetime training, even at its most realistic, and being on a battlefield where an enemy is trying to kill you. It is important that distinction is maintained with respect to compensatory benefits for those two cases. The answer to that problem, from a compensation point of view, may be to maintain the difference which exists under the VEA in terms of the standard of evidence required between the two cases, and not restrict the VEA only to those who have had operational, hazardous or peacekeeping service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill directly affects current and future serving members of the ADF. In the fullness of time, all current members will become veterans, so veterans are indirectly involved. I do not get the feeling, having talked to a number of members of the ADF, that there is much understanding of the significance of this bill for serving members of the uniformed services. As such, there is no criticism from members of the ADF about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The veteran community, however, is quite different. Almost universally, veterans dislike the bill, and they dislike the direction it is taking. They have a range of reasons why they are opposed to the bill and some of those reasons, in my judgment, are very well founded. I propose to test the government on particular applications of the bill and how it interprets it at the committee stage. In light of those answers, it may or may not be necessary to move some amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does not oppose this legislation. We have a number of serious reservations, some of which I have mentioned. The bill does confer benefits which, as I said in the introduction to my speech, legally confer the same status on the ADF as the Public Service. The concept of providing re-training with a view to establishing a new career where a person will be self-supporting is laudable and to be supported. The inclusion of those who have been part of the Defence Force from time immemorial but were not actually service personnel is also worth while. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the coverage of the reservists by the military compensation scheme is very necessary and long overdue. While reservists have been covered in some ways in the past, I have had numerous complaints over the years from reservists regarding the great difficulties in getting compensation for injuries received in training. This bill should provide a clearer picture for reservists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those men and women who wear the uniform of the Australian Defence Force undertake great obligations on behalf of the Australian community. The parliament must ensure that, in return for the sacrifice members of the ADF make in peace and in war, the compensation awarded to them is commensurate with the effort that they make. The opposition will be watching very closely the implementation of this legislation to see that those objectives are attained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Military Compensation Bill 1994 is obvious from the title. It is to establish a compensation scheme covering injuries and disabilities suffered in the course of the full range of military activities. At the same time, Australian Defence Force personnel injured during operational, peacekeeping or hazardous service will retain the option of coverage under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Personnel who began full-time continuous service before 1986 will retain that choice for all forms of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The military compensation scheme will operate, in effect, as a specialised extension of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act of 1988, otherwise known as the SRC Act. It will be administered by staff dedicated to the new scheme&mdash;the same arrangement as now applies with the SRC Act&mdash;and will feature a number of additional benefits which recognise the unique demands and hazards of military service. That is, the unintended consequences of Commonwealth supplied medical treatment will again be covered. This restores a benefit which applied, as I understand it, prior to 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will be able to declare certain classes of non-military personnel eligible for benefits&mdash;for example, members of philanthropic bodies who are authorised to provide services to the Australian defence forces. I certainly would support that. Also, incapacitated ADF members who are discharged within 45 weeks of their injury will, nevertheless, receive 100 per cent of their pre-injury weekly earnings for the full 45 weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Judging from the letters and faxes which have come in during the last few days, this bill has aroused disquiet and concern in both the service and ex-service communities. The most general concern seems to be that ADF personnel have vastly different conditions to the public servants for whom the SRC Act was designed. This should be recognised by maintaining all compensation benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have some sympathy for the proposal that all benefits should be put under the one legislative roof. The government maintains that this option was looked at but was found to be impractical. The argument put to us was that because the SRC Act is about income support during rehabilitation, while the Veterans' Entitlements Act is concerned with pensions and ongoing medical treatment, it would be a major headache to put them together. In our view, what matters at the end of the day is whether the benefits provided by the military compensation scheme and the Veterans' Entitlements Act together are fair, comprehensive and tailored to the unique demands of defence service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the benefits to be provided under the military compensation scheme on top of those already in the SRC Act. The question is whether there are any gaps in coverage which need to be filled. During our briefing by the department on this bill&mdash;and I must compliment those who came because it was, perhaps, one of the best briefings I have received; very comprehensive and certainly backed up with very helpful notes&mdash;we asked why coverage for the unintended consequences of Commonwealth funded medical treatment had not been backdated to 1988 when it was struck down. The government has indicated that it is looking at whether this hole can be plugged administratively. Surely it would be more straightforward to move an amendment which puts the issue beyond doubt. The extra burden on the Commonwealth is hardly likely to be large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested to us that the cessation of incapacity benefits under the SRC Act after age 65 could leave some beneficiaries in a parlous financial state, particularly if their military superannuation entitlements are small or non-existent. The Democrats recognise that people over 65 would be entitled to other forms of income support, which is why the threshold is there. It may be that there is no problem, but we would urge further dialogue between the government, the service and the ex-service communities. To clear up the matter, this would seem to be in order. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a suggestion that the travel provisions of the SRC Act may not adequately cover the travel obligations of defence personnel, for example, to and from exercise areas. On our reading, section 6 of the SRC Act is quite general and casts a wide net. However, we ask the government whether it has considered introducing a form of words which would unambiguously cover the military situation and allay the fears of the defence community. I urge the minister to look again at that. The need for an independent appeal mechanism has also been raised with us. However, the Democrats are satisfied with the provisions in the SRC Act for appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, the Democrats see the military compensation scheme as a positive initiative. It extends compensation which emphasises rehabilitation to all forms of defence service, including operational service. At the same time, it recognises the need for continuity by keeping open the option of the Veterans' Entitlements Act for the more risky forms of military service. The Democrats will be supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank Senator MacGibbon and Senator Woodley for their contributions to this very important debate on the Military Compensation Bill. Until 1949, defence personnel rendering peacetime service were not covered under any specific compensation legislation. Since that time, peacetime service in the Defence Force has been covered by Commonwealth compensation legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1973, as we have heard from Senator MacGibbon, the Labor government amended the Repatriation Act 1920 to allow defence members rendering full-time service during peacetime access to compensation cover through some of the provisions of the Repatriation Act. After a three-year qualifying period, those on full-time peacetime service were given access to the disability provisions of the Repatriation Act. Those provisions were applied with the normal `civilian' proofs of the Commonwealth compensation scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has long held the view that the Repatriation Act is not an appropriate vehicle for peacetime compensation coverage of the Australian Defence Force. This view was demonstrated in 1986 when the Veterans' Entitlements Act, which replaced the Repatriation Act, specifically recognised the need for a peacetime military compensation scheme and provided access to limited veterans' benefits only until such time as the military compensation scheme was put in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for action on Defence Force compensation has become obvious during recent operational deployments by the ADF in Cambodia and Somalia which have highlighted an anomaly under the current arrangements for compensation. Service men and women on operational service have fewer options for compensation benefits than do those on less risky types of service. This is because the current Commonwealth compensation legislation, the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, cannot be applied to those on operational service. The realisation of the inequity of the current arrangements for those on operational service has caused the government to act to provide a more balanced system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government agreed in June 1992 to introduce a military compensation scheme for ADF members on peacetime service. The MCS will replace current arrangements under which members with peacetime service are eligible for compensation under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act and some of the provisions of the Veterans' Entitlements Act. MCS comprises cover under the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act with additional benefits to be provided as follows: firstly, cover for the unintended consequences of any medical treatment provided at Commonwealth expense; and, secondly, members discharged less than 45 weeks after being injured or becoming ill will receive 45 weeks compensation at the rate of their normal weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon commencement the MCS will provide the sole cover for most members in peacetime service. This includes cadets, instructors of cadets, officers with honorary rank, philanthropic representatives and ex-members on discharge training. All members who join the ADF after the introduction of the MCS will have the MCS as their only compensation cover for peacetime service. To ensure that there is no detriment to those who have an entitlement to VEA cover, there is provision in the VEA for those who enlisted before that act commenced in 1986 and who continue to render full-time service after the MCS is implemented to retain cover under the VEA in addition to the cover provided by the MCS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Service men and women who enlisted after the introduction of the VEA and have completed a three-year period of service to qualify for VEA coverage will retain that coverage for the period from their enlistment until the introduction of the MCS. Service women and men who enlisted after the introduction of the VEA in 1986 but fail to achieve the three-year qualifying service for coverage under the VEA will be covered for peacetime service under the SRCA and then, after its enactment, the MCS only. Claims may be made under the VEA after the commencement of the MCS for an injury or disease arising out of a period of service when an individual was covered under the VEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the MCS has been designed primarily for ADF members rendering peacetime service, it is recognised that the scheme may also be attractive for those undertaking operational, hazardous or peacekeeping duties. As an example, the MCS provides for lump sum payments and significant rehabilitation benefits that are not available under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. For this reason, the legislation includes the provision for those rendering peacekeeping, hazardous or operational service to be given the choice of electing benefits under either the MCS or the VEA for injuries or diseases arising out of that service. This arrangement acknowledges the greater risks and difficulties associated with non-peacetime service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of VEA coverage for peacekeeping, hazardous and operational service provides a progressive scale of benefits with the greatest range of benefits open to those who do provide operational service. Those on peacetime service receive cover under the MCS. Those on peacekeeping or hazardous service have the choice of cover under either the MCS or the disability provisions of the VEA, while members on operational service have the option of cover under the MCS or the full provisions of the VEA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the development of the MCS, consideration was given to the option of providing the scheme as an amendment under the VEA. However, for a number of very sound reasons, this option was not adopted. At the heart of the matter, Defence was already administering the SRCA. As the MCS was to be based on the SRCA, it was logical to retain that administration with Defence. It was also important that Defence be retained as the administrator of the scheme to ensure that it fulfilled its responsibilities as an employer. It is no longer acceptable for an employer to take no interest in the rehabilitation of those individuals who are injured through work. A separate MCS, administered by Defence, brings this employer responsibility into sharp focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The responsibilities for occupational health and safety, compensation and rehabilitation are closely aligned. An MCS administered by Defence will allow the ADF to integrate these important areas. This arrangement will help to ensure that an injured service man or woman is provided with continuous support through a process of treatment and rehabilitation, both within and outside the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much has been said during consultations, as part of the preparation of this bill, about the role currently filled by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Although the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a long and excellent history of administering veterans' benefits over 70 years, it has little experience in managing the type of rehabilitation and vocational retraining that is the hallmark of modern compensation legislation such as the MCS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective rehabilitation is at the core of modern compensation legislation. It is Defence, not Veterans' Affairs, that currently fulfils this rehabilitation and vocational training responsibility under the SRCA. The MCS will allow Defence to continue to fulfil this responsibility and to develop and improve it into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much rehabilitation work is carried out now by the defence forces' medical services and through a highly effective system of schools and training courses. The MCS allows the coordination of medical, occupational health and safety, compensation, rehabilitation and defence administration in an efficient and effective manner. The government is committed to keeping the MCS separate from the VEA. Although both schemes provide excellent benefits, they are different schemes and they do have a different focus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefits available under the MCS are those of a modern compensation scheme. The package has been specifically designed for the serving member of the Defence Force. It is based on a well tested, high quality package which is widely recognised as one of the best schemes in Australia. Administration of the MCS has been deleted from the Defence commercial support program. This means that the MCS will not be commercialised and administration of the scheme will remain with Defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Defence infrastructure for administration of the scheme is already in place and will not require major enhancement to deal with an expected gradual increase in workload. Defence is currently examining options to improve computer support for its occupational health and safety, compensation and rehabilitation functions. An outcome of this will be improved efficiency in compensation claims management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of my staff, officers of the ADF and the departments of defence and veterans' affairs have undertaken an extensive round of briefings and consultations with interest groups as part of the development of this legislation. I do appreciate that Senator Woodley indicated that the briefings he had received on this piece of legislation were as good as, if not better than, any other he had received since he became a senator. I think that is true of the nature of the briefings on this legislation that have been given more broadly to other interest groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But these consultations did raise a number of areas of concern amongst interest groups. The government has been able to address a number of these issues through changes in legislation or by administrative action. For example, as a result of consultations with the RSL, the bill has been amended to provide for a Defence Force representative on the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. This inclusion will ensure that the Defence point of view on these important matters will be clearly represented in advice to government. The ADF will undertake a program to educate its members to ensure that the full benefits of compensation are available to all of its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Defence, Mr Punch, during the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, the government is working to improve the cover for the unintended consequences of medical treatment to include those injured from 1 December 1988. Members who have suffered an injury or disease as an unintended consequence of medical treatment for a non-compensable condition are provided with cover under the MCS. This cover was also available before the introduction of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act in 1988. The government has recognised that some individuals might be unintentionally disadvantaged by the five-year gap in cover between the introduction of the SRCA and the introduction of the MCS. The government has directed that this matter be addressed as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice from the Attorney-General's Department is that the new provision for coverage of the unintended consequences of medical treatment does not apply to events which occur before its commencement; that is, it does not give retrospective cover. The government will bring forward an amendment in the winter sittings to provide any coverage that is necessary in this respect. This, and a range of other lesser matters that are under development, demonstrates very clearly that the government is committed to effective consultation, to meaningful action and a cooperative approach to ensure that the service men and women of this country receive the best possible support from the wider community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, compensation is one of the most complex areas of legislation. The package presented today has been carefully crafted, carefully considered and adjusted to ensure that it will function well within the constraints of other legislation, Australian Defence Force and defence structures, financial limitations, the expectations of the community and the culture of the ADF. The MCS is a practical and workable response to this situation. It will serve the ADF very well for years into the future. I commend this bill to the Senate. </PARA>

The working party will be made up of representatives from industry, export marketing, research and agricultural production and will present its paper to the Prime Minister's committee in the middle of this year. These two initiatives, together with the growing recognition in the industry of the great potential for Australia in Asia, will result in the expansion of food exports towards the Agri-Food Council goal of $7 billion by the end of this decade.</PARA>

The ABS measure of profit share of GDP has risen to 17.7 per cent in the December quarter&mdash;the highest since the September quarter 1985. The constraint imposed by balance sheet restructuring for major corporations appears to have eased substantially over the past year, with gearing ratios having returned to more normal levels.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The director of the International Atomic Energy Agency yesterday reported to the IAEA board of governors that agency inspectors were prevented from carrying out some essential safeguards activities in North Korea. As a result, the agency was not in a position to verify that there had been no diversion of nuclear material for weapons purposes since inspections were halted by the DPRK last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious and disturbing development which again calls into question North Korea's commitment to peace and stability in North-East Asia, to a nuclear weapons free Korean peninsula, and to defining a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue. We regret particularly that the DPRK chose to obstruct the IAEA's inspection activities after earlier having agreed in detail with the agency on the range of activities that inspectors would be allowed to conduct. This agreement had been reached as part of an initial package of steps leading to the resumption of high level talks with the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPRK has been well aware that such obstruction would require action by the IAEA board of governors. That board will consider the matter at a full special session on 21 March under Australian chairmanship.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this environment we hope that Pyongyang will reconsider its position and allow IAEA inspectors to return to North Korea to complete the agreed schedule of activities. Completion of the inspections and progress in North Korea's dialogue with the South were the two conditions set down by the US for holding the third round of its own high level talks with the DPRK. Without progress on these fronts, there seems to be little prospect of dialogue proceeding constructively in the near future.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. With reference to his press release last night on tax file numbers and disability pensions, why did disabled veterans have to suffer for so long? Why did he take so long to act when, by his own press release, the powers are within his hands to get rid of this nonsense?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1823" SPEAKER="Faulkner Sen J.P." NAMEID="5K4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="DEFENCE SCIENCE AND PERSONNEL; VETERANS' AFFAIRS; SPORT AND TERRITORIES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have recently received a range of representations from veterans who are in receipt of a disability pension only and who have complained about the necessity to provide a tax file number to the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I have also spoken personally, of course, to a number of veterans about this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will try to spell this out in monosyllables for Senator MacGibbon. As minister, I do not have the discretionary power under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to grant disability pensioners, or any other Veterans' Affairs beneficiaries, exemptions from the requirement to provide tax file numbers. Under the legislation, discretion lies with the secretary to my department.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also illegal and improper for me to direct the secretary to exercise a discretionary power in a particular way on individual cases. But, because I have received a number of submissions on this matter, I have asked the secretary to the department to sympathetically re-examine the discretionary guidelines that he established in 1991 in the light of those submissions. In asking him to look at that matter, I emphasise that I do not expect the secretary to provide exemptions which effectively cut across the fraud detection measures the government has set in place. The secretary has agreed to do this as quickly as possible and he will be reporting back to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As background for Senator MacGibbon, who obviously has a very limited understanding of this matter, the tax file number enables accurate matching of data across agencies such as Social Security to ensure that people are receiving correct payments and to eliminate duplicate or other unlawful payments. I think a number of people, including some senators, have obviously overlooked that the DVA disability pension is considered as income for pension purposes by the Department of Social Security. The tax file number is used in the data matching process to ensure the correct identification of those in receipt of both payments. It could be possible, for instance, for a person with a similar name to the disability pensioner to be unnecessarily inconvenienced by the need to provide further information to prove that he or she is not that person and is not receiving dual payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the tax file number eliminates that problem. More than 250 cases have been detected to date where people had not disclosed their disability pension payments to the Department of Social Security and, as a result, were overpaid DSS pensions. Savings of $110 million from data matching across all agencies were reported to this parliament in 1993. The actual gross savings in program outlays achieved for the first half of the financial year by the Department of Veterans' Affairs are some $2 million.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. Overlooking the fact that the minister committed suicide with his own tongue when he admitted that the contents of his press release were correct as I quoted them, that he directed the secretary to review the conditions under which tax file numbers led to the restriction of the disability pension, and given the great distress this has caused disabled veterans in Australia, some of whom have been denied a pension they are entitled to for over 12 months, why was it not proceeded with earlier? Why were other authorities, like the Department of Social Security, not required to obtain the tax file number when granting an age pension or one of those other benefits? Why were they not tasked with getting the tax file number when the disability pension is a right for a pensioner who has served this country and disabled himself in the service of the country with respect to the normal enjoyment of his life? Once he qualifies for that pension he is entitled to have it. He is not entitled to be harassed and treated as a criminal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know what Senator MacGibbon had for lunch but it has obviously affected him very badly indeed. Under the legislation, it is up to the secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs to make decisions about any extra exemptions&mdash;and there are many now. It would be improper for me to try to pre-empt the advice that he will give me. I have asked him to sympathetically look at the representations that have been made and give full consideration to all the issues that are involved. It seems to me that where disability pensioners have proof that their other income&mdash;for example, from DSS pensions&mdash;would rule them out, those may be examples of appropriate cases for exemption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But properly and appropriately I will wait for advice from my department, and that is how it will occur.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In question time yesterday Senator Herron asked me how I could justify the expenditure of $9 million on the caucus-ACTU working party, examining my private health insurance reform proposals, and why we had allocated 15 staff to the working party.

In addition, the department has paid airfares for one of those officers and a member of the caucus committee's secretariat who is providing administrative support for the working party. The cost of those airfares to date, for three trips to Melbourne and one to Sydney, is $3,126, not $9 million.

In estimates on Tuesday he heard Senator Newman ask a series of questions on this matter. A moment later at that hearing he referred to my answer to Senator Lees and asked about the $2 million of the $9 million which was to be spent on studying costings for DRGs. His next question led to an admission by a departmental officer that some of the consultancies cannot be let until after the working party has reported, yet he still asked a question on how we are spending $9 million on the working party. That is what is called a pathetic effort.</PARA>

Again, I would like to say this for the record: I challenge Senator Kernot, through you, Mr Deputy President, to affirm that there was absolutely no element of thuggery about last night's meeting. There was some firm debate. The only time one senator rose from his seat was when Senator Murphy went to get a cup of tea.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, the tenor of the debate and the strength of the language were far less firm than we have heard here during this debate, so I do not believe that in any way the events could be referred to as thuggery. </PARA>

If those opposite want to get further legal advice, why would they not release this legal advice? The answer is simple: they do not like what is in it. When this advice is released to the public it will show that the reasons they sought this legal advice have blown up in their faces. The advice does not provide them with the answer they wanted, so they have suppressed it&mdash;at a cost of about $6,000, with an additional cost for further legal advice. That is what the legal advice will show, and that is why those opposite want to continue to suppress it. </PARA>

With regard to some of the questions and views that have been expressed here today about some of the decisions that were taken by the committee, these matters have not been accurately reflected in the media, particularly the issue of legal advice that was sought in a motion which I think was initially put forward by Senator Sandy Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal advice was obtained. Whether it suited some members of the committee and not others is not the matter in point. The government members of the committee sought to have that advice published so that people could make a judgment on it one way or another. But that was not to be. I think the decision taken by the committee was that Senator Kernot move a motion to issue a public statement with regard to a decision of the committee to seek further advice. This motion was carried by a majority vote. But that was not reported in the press. The government members of the committee have had great concern about this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to my initial point. It is very unfortunate for this committee now to be basically conducting its business by way of question and answer. I think this brings the integrity and propriety of the committee into disrepute.

<PARA>I move this motion because it is the third time that the minister has denied that there will be any change in the Medicare tax. I was reminded of a biblical reference as he was denying it on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but on this occasion, however, it is Paul rather than Peter. As on that previous occasion, I am sure the same result will occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every time that the Medicare tax has been increased the number of people privately insured has decreased. Prior to the introduction of Medicare, 70 per cent of the population were insured. When the Medicare tax came in at one per cent the number insured went down to 54 per cent. In 1986 the tax was increased by 25 per cent to 1.25 per cent and the number of privately insured went down to 48 per cent. Last year the tax was increased to 1.4 per cent and the number of privately insured went down to 40 per cent. It does not sound very much&mdash;1.4 per cent of taxable income&mdash;but it takes in $2,885 million. So we are talking about a sizeable sum of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I challenge the minister to tell us why the numbers of the privately insured will not decrease on the next occasion, because it occurred over that period&mdash;and in that time health insurance premiums have risen by over 100 per cent. So it is a matter of cause and effect. He does not seem to understand that. He does not seem to understand the connection which has occurred in the past and which will occur again in the future. It is fairly straightforward. But somehow or other it escapes him. Yet in October last year, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my view, we cannot continue to have private health insurance bleed in the way that it has in the past years because this does increase the strains on the public system.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Private Hospitals Association has cooperated with the minister since December last year in looking at his package of changes, which he calls reforms but which I call further destruction. Today it made the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most bewildering aspect of the discussion paper is that it has correctly identified the major problems in the hospital system, that is, the high and . . . rising cost of private health insurance which causes Australians to opt out of private insurance which in turn leads to increased pressure on the public system, and those most affected are low income earners and the aged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having identified these problems, it has totally ignored them. There is nothing in the proposed reform package that provides any hope of a reduction in the price of private health insurance premiums.</PARA>
<PARA>He cannot have it both ways. On three occasions he refused to deny that there was going to be an increase in the Medicare tax and yet at the same time he is saying that he is going to encourage people into private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make in relation to that aspect is the $8.9 million going to consultancies that are in the process of being let, before the ACTU caucus working party has presented its report. The minister is going ahead&mdash;once again, we have the expenditure of taxpayers' money, over $9 million on this occasion&mdash;before he has got the report. He has prejudged what is going to occur. The money is to be spent in this taxation year. If any other report is brought in that money will be wasted because it is going on consultancies. Over $8 million is to be spent on consultancies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned in my question to the minister the other day, over a three-year period less than $4 million was spent on the Macklin national health strategy. The minister has already put off the report. I think the report is now due on 20 April. Regardless of that report, those consultancies are being let. This is another example of throwing money away on consultancies which may well be scrapped, and nothing may occur as a result. He keeps hiding behind this barrage of words that he uses. </PARA>

<PARA>The minister completed answering this question today. I asked the minister yesterday whether he was aware that the mine proponent had substantially altered the location and design of the facility. I asked, among other things: why has the government allowed the construction of the project to commence before the environment management plans have been completed? I believe the answer I was given today indicates that it is not a mere disregard for the invaluable and unique environmental features of the area that has led to this haste in moving ahead with the mining project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The seagrass beds, the major significant breeding sites for the dugong and the turtle in the Southern Hemisphere, are also Aboriginal dreaming, turtle dreaming and dugong dreaming areas. Something else underlies the government's haste: in the answer I was given today, Senator Richardson assured me that the validation and regranting of the McArthur River leases and exploration licence, including the lease at Bing Bong under the McArthur River Project Agreement Ratification Amendment Act 1993, in no way impairs the Yanyuwa's ability to claim native title. However, he did not say that, while it does not impair their ability to claim native title, it also puts them in the category of having their native title extinguished by the Native Title Act that was passed in 1993. It is an example of the reason the Greens had serious concerns about supporting the bill in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He also says, `I am advised that dredging associated with the barge loading facility will all be within the mining lease area at the Bing Bong facility. No dredging is required outside the lease area'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will not be the last mention of this matter. But I mention it here to place on the public record that this is the first instance where the native title legislation, introduced with such fine rhetoric of protecting Aboriginal interests, is now exposed in its real motivation and may well be the first application where the Native Title Act 1993 is used for the extinguishment of native title. Following debate on the Native Title Bill, the Greens have not forgotten all the undertakings the government gave and all the arguments presented. There was no definite instance where pastoral or other leases would extinguish native title. The government now needs to show the Senate that it did not know that the Bing Bong station was one of the stations that would be found to be invalid by way of native title and, therefore, that it would be validated and then native title extinguished under the Native Title Act 1993. </PARA>

<PARA>The question I asked Senator Faulkner related to tax file numbers and disability pensions. A disability pension is paid to Australian men or women who served in the defence forces and suffered an impairment in either their physical or mental capacities as a consequence of that service. It is paid, therefore, to those who qualify with respect to the diminution in the quality of life that they can enjoy compared to others of the same age group who did not go to war. It therefore means that it is not an income support pension. It is paid in a way that is not means or assets tested. It is almost never withdrawn. It is not taxed in the hands of the recipient. It is very much a pension to compensate these veterans for the impairment in their ability to live a normal life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has demanded that they provide a tax file number before they can qualify or receive a pension. They qualify if they meet the standards required under the Veterans' Entitlements Act. A large number of veterans have refused to supply a tax file number because they believe that it is a gross invasion of their personal privacy. They allege that they have been treated as criminals. If they refuse to provide a tax file number, various people in the Department of Veterans' Affairs accuse them of having something to hide. It has caused enormous distress to veterans. A number of them have refused absolutely to provide it and, as a consequence, they have had their pensions withdrawn and they have suffered financial loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since I asked that question, my phone has run hot. An example of this is the case of a war widow who was on a 100 per cent disability pension and whose husband was on a disability pension. When he died, recently, the Department of Veterans' Affairs&mdash;in her own words&mdash;`coerced and blackmailed' her, in the depth of her despair at the loss of her husband, to provide a tax file number; otherwise she would not get the payment of her war widow pension. I argue that people who qualify for a pension under the act&mdash;and, God knows, it is hard enough to qualify for one&mdash;ought to get it. It is not taxed, assets tested or means tested&mdash;unlike most pensions that the government provides. The obligation is on the other departments&mdash;such as the Department of Social Security, if it is going to provide an age pension&mdash;to do a tax file check to make sure there is no fraud. The obligation to do it should not be on the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner accused me of being ignorant of the act. It was because I understood the act that I encouraged those people to come forward in recent days to talk about the great injustice that had been done to them. In the minister's own press release, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although discretionary power legally rests with the Secretary of my Department and not with me as Minister, I have asked the Secretary to take a look at his discretionary guidelines for exemption from provision of the tax file number.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the point I put to Senator Faulkner. What he did, in legal terms, is known as dissembling. The other thing he did was confirm that the tax file number is being used for cross-checking purposes right across all government departments. When the tax file number was brought before this chamber, the government argued and argued that it was for the Australian Taxation Office and was not to be used as a fingerprint, as an Australia Card substitute&mdash;for which Senator Faulkner has admitted that it is now being used.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner was acutely embarrassed by my question, because it caught him red-handed. It showed him to be totally insensitive and uncaring. This matter has been going on for years. I know veterans who lost their disability pensions in February last year. He has been shown to be totally unresponsive to the demands made on him. That provision was always in the act. He has not acted on it. He sat on it for years. It is absolutely inexcusable, as he realised when public pressure was building up yesterday. Six hours after Mr Leonard Teale appeared on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, Senator Faulkner raised the white flag and surrendered.

The relevant amendments to the Industrial Relations Act 1988 (the IR Act) made by the Industrial Relations Reform Act 1993 (the Reform Act) are expected to be proclaimed to take effect on 30 March 1994. For convenience, they are referred to as if they are in operation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">R.1As a general principle, industrial disputes should be dealt with in the first instance under industrial relations legislation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is reflected in the Reform Act. In particular, provision is made for pre-litigation conciliation by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission where federally registered trade unions, or their officers, members or employees, are involved in a secondary boycott which is prohibited by new section 162 of the IR Act (which is inserted by section 38 of the Reform Act). Similarly, pre-litigation conciliation is required by new section 166A of the IR Act (which is  inserted by section 40 of the Reform Act) where a tort action is to be taken against a federally registered trade union or its officers, members or employees in respect of an industrial dispute which is within the jurisdiction of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">R.2Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act be repealed and the Act revised to deal with boycotts involving competitors where they have the purpose of reducing competition in a given market or otherwise restricting the trade of particular enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act 1974 is amended by section 43 of the Reform Act. Section 45D now applies only to secondary boycotts which have the purpose and effect of causing a substantial lessening of competition in a market.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 44 of the Reform Act repeals section 45E.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">R.3The Industrial Relations Act be amended:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b)  to provide for a mechanism to deal expeditiously with boycotts and other industrial action of the kind which has hitherto been subject to action under sections 45D and 45E;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c)  to provide that where a dispute has been dealt with by industrial relations mechanisms, and a speedy resolution has been unable to be effected, a  certificate should be issued enabling the matter to be dealt with in a civil jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees with the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to R.3(a), the provision is made in the IR Act in relation to the internationally recognised right to engage in industrial action. This is achieved by amendments under the Reform Act.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under new section 170PG, a federally registered trade union or a member, officer or employee of the union may engage in peaceful industrial action in support of a claim for an agreement which is intended to be certified under the IR Act. An employer is given a corresponding capacity to lock out employees, either in response to such industrial action, or in support of a claim by the employer. This is subject to certain notice provisions and to supervision by the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (the AIRC).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 170PG and related provisions of new Division 4&mdash;Immunity from civil liability&mdash;of new Part VIB&mdash;promoting bargaining and facilitating agreements&mdash;are inserted by section 30 of the Reform Act.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to R.3(b) and (c), there is now machinery for pre-litigation conciliation before the AIRC in relation to prohibited secondary boycotts&mdash;see above. This may be for up to 72 hours. At the end of that period (unless a certificate is given sooner), the AIRC must issue a  certificate permitting an action for an injunction or damages or both to be brought before the new Industrial Relations Court of Australia (see new sections 163D, 163G and 163H of the IR Act, inserted by section 38 of the Reform Act).</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, as referred to above, there is now a requirement for pre-litigation conciliation before the AIRC where a tort action is proposed to be taken against a federally registered trade union or its officers, members or employees in relation to an industrial dispute that is within the jurisdiction of the AIRC. This may be for up to 72 hours. At the end of that period, if a certificate has not been given sooner, the AIRC must issue a certificate which will allow proceedings to be brought before a court for a common law injunction or damages. This is provided for by new section 166A of the AI Act, inserted by section 40 of the Reform Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ON GAS AND ELECTRICITY: COMBINING EFFICIENCY AND GREENHOUSE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PREAMBLE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report of the Senate Standing Committee, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gas and Electricity: Combining Efficiency and Greenhouse</EMPHASIS>, was tabled on 10 December 1992. The Government is now in a position to respond to the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report contains 19 recommendations which form the basis of a national approach to energy supply designed to achieve energy supply efficiency and reduce levels of greenhouse gas emissions. The government commends the Committee for its report which has canvassed in detail the major greenhouse issues confronting the gas and electricity sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to consider the task given to the Committee in context. When the Commonwealth, States and Territories agreed in 1990 to the Interim Planning Target to reduce greenhouse emissions, they also agreed to work jointly to develop a National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS). Policy options for possible incorporation in this Strategy were developed through 1991 in a series of reports, notably those of the Ecologically Sustainable Development (ESD) Working Groups. These in turn built on earlier reports, including the Senate Committee's previous complementary work on the greenhouse effect and energy use, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Rescue the Future: reducing the impact of the greenhouse effect</EMPHASIS> which had, incidentally, recommended that governments develop a NGRS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government saw the work of the Committee as ideally complementing that done by the ESD Working Groups, in that it would provide another frame of reference in the development of appropriate policies which would assist Australia in meeting its Interim Planning Target to reduce greenhouse emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interim planning target agreed to by Governments is for Australia to stabilise greenhouse gases at 1988 levels by the year 2000, and to reduce those emissions by 20% by the year 2005 subject to Australia not implementing response measures which would have net adverse economic impacts nationally or on Australia's trade competitiveness, in the absence of similar action by major greenhouse gas producing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for the Committee's focus on electricity and gas was twofold. Firstly, these sectors are major contributors to Australia's greenhouse emissions. As noted in the ESD reports, emission reduction strategies will need to focus on options available within the energy production and energy use sectors because they are the most easily quantified and the most readily controlled. The electricity and gas sectors have been estimated to account for nearly 34% of Australian greenhouse gas emissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, gas and electricity are key elements of the micro-economic reform initiatives being pursued by governments. The main objective of micro-economic reform in the gas and electricity service sectors is to improve economic efficiency and productivity. These benefits will flow through the economy which will enhance the competitive base of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to ensure that the economic objectives of micro-reform and the environmental objectives of meeting greenhouse emission targets are appropriately integrated. This was the Committee's principal concern&mdash;to make recommendations which reconcile possible conflicts between economic and environmental imperatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations made by the Committee also need to be viewed against the NGRS and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Strategy for Ecological Sustainable Development</EMPHASIS> which have been agreed to by governments. The ESD and Greenhouse Strategies commit governments to a set of broad goals and principles which will guide their efforts to ensure that Australia's future development is ecologically sustainable. The Strategies also commit governments to a range of early actions, aimed at giving effect to these goals and principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NGRS presented a range of actions for governments to take, as a first phase of responses to greenhouse issues. They concentrate on the use of "no regrets" measures, that is measures which have net benefits, or at least no net costs, outside of their effects on greenhouse emissions. The NGRS includes a section on measures to be undertaken in the energy supply sector. Many of these measures are similar to those that have been recommended by the Committee. Some of the required response actions are already under way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reaching agreement on the development of response measures, governments adopted a number of important core principles, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">response measures should be effective in furthering the strategy goal, and economically efficient;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">response measures should be directed towards the interim planning target; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">response measures should take account of other competing or complementary goals, policies and priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments also identified the characteristics of first phase response measures, including:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">in respect of both no-regrets measures and insurance measures, any economic and social costs will be low; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">first phase measures will meet equity objectives by causing minimal disruption to the wider community, any single industry sector, or any particular geographic region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The timing of the finalisation of the Committee's report was such that it was unable to take into account, in the development of its recommendations, these agreed principles and characteristics. It is understandable, therefore, that in some respects the Committee's recommendations go beyond what has already been mandated by governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this respect, the Committee has not accepted the thrust of certain micro-economic reforms proposed by the Government, particularly in the electricity sector, which are regarded as being inconsistent with environmental goals. The Government does not believe that this is the case. The rationale for many of these important structural and operational reforms rejected by the Committee have since been embraced by Heads of Government. In those few instances where the views of the Committee have not been accepted, the reasoning behind the Government's thinking has been elaborated in the response to the specific recommendation in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government believes that the approach it has taken with respect to certain areas of micro-economic reform is consistent with meeting environmental objectives. It believes that structural reform of the electricity and gas industries will remove distortions in the energy market which impede the pursuit of ESD and greenhouse objectives. The Government is firmly of the view that the micro-economic reform will be beneficial not only economically but environmentally as well. Those areas where the Government believes specific micro-economic reform initiatives in the electricity and gas sectors can deliver real environmental benefits has been spelt out in the response to the Committee's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general, and as already indicated, one of the primary objectives of the current program of micro-economic reform is to remove any excessive or unnecessary costs to Australian industry, and thus to raise Australia's trade competitiveness and general prosperity. A more prosperous Australia will be better able to afford any future costs that may be associated with emissions limitations measures. The reforms proposed by the Government, for the electricity sector in particular, are likely to achieve a number of the results the Committee is looking for. A more competitive electricity market, allied with commercially oriented suppliers, will produce incentives to promote electricity conservation, where such measures are more cost-effective than building additional capacity. The expansion of the interstate electricity grid will enable existing capacity to be better and more efficiently utilised, new generating capacity will be deferred and no new capacity will be developed unless commercially feasible and only where it is more cost effective than demand management. The gradual removal of existing capital subsidies and cross-subsidies will lead to more efficient and rational patterns of energy use and promote the greater use of renewables, particularly in remote localities where they are already cost competitive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1:</EMPHASIS> That where an independent energy audit is able to demonstrate that the cost of improving efficiency of new or existing buildings, under the control of the (Commonwealth) government, its departments or agencies, can be recovered by savings in energy charges in less than five years, building managers be required to implement these measures. (Para 1.26)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qualified support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has a comprehensive energy policy which interacts with economic and social sectors to foster the more efficient use of energy in an environmentally benign manner. The policy is effected principally through a National Energy Management Program. The program not only utilises information dissemination but also provides financial incentives and is involved principally with the States in the development of national energy standards and codes of practice. An important component of the program is the energy efficiency of Commonwealth operations, particularly of buildings and motor vehicles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July 1992, a Commonwealth buildings energy audit program was initiated which applies to non-residential buildings occupied by Commonwealth departments and agencies. This program operated for the 1992-93 Financial Year and individual audits conducted for departments and agencies were paid for in full out of the program funds. A similar program operates for the industrial and commercial sector for which Government Business Enterprises are eligible. A number of other measures complement building audits within the Commonwealth sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth buildings energy audit program requires that the audits be undertaken by accredited energy auditors. Wider measures in place also require departments and agencies to develop energy management plans which provide a framework within which energy audits can be planned and appropriate measures implemented in light of the audit report recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agencies have been given both the means and incentive to implement energy audit findings. The movement of property operating expenses into running costs provides incentives for Commonwealth agencies to improve energy efficiency. Once property resource agreements are signed, agencies will be able to allocate, or bring forward from later years, funds from their running costs to implement viable energy efficiency measures identified from energy audits. Net savings in energy expenditure identified by initial energy audits will be shared equally between the agency and the Budget. Whilst there is no compulsion on agencies to implement the findings of the audit report, as recommended by the Committee, the Government believes that these measures taken in totality meet the intent of this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2:</EMPHASIS> That in the future, governments and the electricity and gas authorities themselves take a broader view of their role and introduce whatever measures to reduce or control (greenhouse) emissions which can be shown to be economic. (Para 1.40)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGRS, agreed to by Australian Governments, contains a series of response actions in the energy supply sector which will assist in reducing or controlling greenhouse emissions. These response actions place certain obligations on governments in the development of a competitive market for electricity supply in eastern and southern Australia. Electricity reform initiatives are being progressed through the National Grid Management Council (NGMC), established by Heads of Government in July 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGRS requires governments: to accommodate cogeneration schemes in their planning activities by providing appropriate and fair buy-back arrangements for the purchase of surplus electricity; to provide for non-discriminatory access by generators, demand-side option suppliers and customers through competitive bidding; to develop an integrated least cost planning approach including both supply and demand side options; to expand the use of renewable energy where there are suitable opportunities; and to develop programs to facilitate the use of cost competitive renewable energy resources for stand-alone power supply systems for remote and rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGMC, in developing electricity reform proposals for governments, has been cognisant of the requirements imposed by the NGRS. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Grid Protocol</EMPHASIS> developed by the NGMC and released in December 1992, sets out a framework for the efficient development and operation of the electricity supply system. The Protocol, agreed to by Heads of Government, indicates that the national grid will be operated in such a manner that will enable many of the NGRS response actions to be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, the Protocol indicates that specific provision is to be made for demand side option suppliers under the competitive bidding processes in a manner which will provide for least cost long term solutions. The Government supports demand management and renewable energy options having equal opportunity alongside conventional supply side options to satisfy future electricity requirements. Further work is to be done in this area, including by the NGMC, with Heads of Government having called for a report on demand management opportunities to be provided for its next meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms provide for transparent pricing which will reveal the real economic cost of providing power from the grid to remote areas. The Government believes that this will create a positive framework for the development of price competitive remote area power supply systems based on renewable energy sources such as solar thermal, wind and small hydro and will further encourage the development of a renewable energy industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGMC is also investigating the technical and economic feasibility of extensions to, or upgrading of, the interstate transmission links. The Committee in its deliberations noted the potential this created for the sharing of spinning reserve with consequent reductions in fuel use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additionally, under the National Gas Strategy, the Government, in consultation with the States, is promoting the greater utilisation of gas through the freeing up of the market through the removal of impediments to free and fair trade in natural gas. This holds the key to encouraging greater exploration and development of this fuel. Greater utilisation of gas will have significant environmental and greenhouse benefits. Research is also being undertaken into the use of coal-bed methane to enable the harnessing of this valuable resource.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3:</EMPHASIS> That there be a ten year moratorium on the construction of new conventional generation plant by the electricity authorities. (Para 1.50)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No action required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories have responsibility for their electricity supply industries, including the construction of new power generation capacity. The Commonwealth has only limited responsibilities in respect to the construction of new generation plant, for example if the project impinges on Commonwealth land or water, or if Commonwealth funding is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's international comparative advantage in electricity is based on coal fired electricity generation. The cost of producing coal fired electricity in Australia continues to decline, further improving Australia's international competitiveness in energy intensive production and enhancing the performance of our manufacturing sector. At the same time, the environmental performance of coal fired power stations continues to improve. The Commonwealth notes that the adoption of a ten year moratorium on the construction of new conventional generation plant by the electricity authorities was not a measure that was included in the first phase of the NGRS endorsed by Heads of Government in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another Commonwealth/State forum, the NGMC, has responded to this recommendation stating that it considered the approach to be too simplistic. The NGMC pointed out that the apparent justification for the recommendation was difficulties associated with objectively assessing whether all opportunities for cogeneration and energy savings through efficiency which can be realised at a lower cost than installing new capacity had been fully exploited. The NGMC accepted that there remain difficulties with making competitive assessments of demand and supply measures. Nevertheless, it was suggested that it would be more appropriate to seek to overcome such difficulties rather than imposing a somewhat arbitrary moratorium, particularly where a clear need for new capacity is demonstrated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth suggests that the Committee's recommendation implies a vertically integrated electricity supply industry in which governments are able to dictate the timing and nature of new electricity generation capacity. Under the micro-economic reforms, agreed to by Heads of Government, a competitive market structure is to be implemented by 1 July 1995. This structure will provide for open access for new generation, including from the private sector. The need for any new generation capacity should be reduced with the implementation of micro-economic reform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of the competitive generation market and the overall framework for the efficient development and operation of the electricity supply system in eastern and southern Australia are set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Grid Protocol</EMPHASIS>. The Protocol indicates that competitive sourcing processes will ensure that new capacity, whether on the supply or demand side, is sourced in a manner involving least cost long term solutions. It is proposed that all expressions of interest and bids submitted under the competitive sourcing process would be subject to independent review. This approach, if successfully implemented, should provide an effective means by which alternatives for new generation capacity, such as cogeneration, energy efficiency and demand management will be fully explored. This, essentially, is the objective of the Committee's proposed moratorium.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years there has been an increasing number of proposals for the construction of cogeneration plants, small hydro, and renewables including solar thermal, wind and agricultural waste. A competitive generation market is expected to provide further encouragement to these projects as an alternative to large scale conventional plant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initiatives being pursued by the NGMC which make more efficient use of existing capacity, including new and upgraded interstate transmission links and the greater use of demand side options, have the potential to delay the need for new generation capacity in the southern and eastern States until after the turn of the century. Generally, any increase in demand in this period in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland can be met by newly constructed generation units such as Loy Yang B, Mt Piper and Stanwell. Demand projections for Queensland, however, indicate that 300 MW of new capacity will be required each year from 1998 to 2001. The Queensland Government is currently examining options for meeting this demand. The need for the first increments in new capacity could be considerably delayed should the New South Wales and Queensland Governments agree to the construction of a transmission link between their States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only other coal fired generation indicated within the Committee's time frame is in Western Australia. It is not technically feasible for Western Australia to be connected to the eastern states grid and demand growth dictates that new capacity will be required. The West Australian Government at this time remains committed to coal, although gas is a feasible alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 4:</EMPHASIS> That greater use of gas be made in a wide variety of applications including direct use where possible and as a fuel for power generation. (Para 3.15)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government supports the Committee's recommendation and considers the most appropriate manner of implementing the recommendation is through the removal of impediments to free and fair trade in natural gas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard, at the Council of Australian Governments (CoAG) held in Perth on 7 December 1992, Heads of Government noted that there were barriers to trade in natural gas which could inhibit gas industry development and discourage exploration and the commercial development of gas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CoAG requested the Australia and New Zealand Minerals and Energy Council (ANZMEC) to submit a report to the CoAG meeting held on 8 June 1993. The report:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANZMEC report on removal of governmental impediments to free and fair trade in gas was considered by CoAG in June 1993. Heads of Government agreed to cooperate in the development of policies and arrangements covering the gas industry which are pro-competitive, facilitate the development of gas markets on commercial criteria and remove impediments to free and fair trade in gas. CoAG called for a further report for its next meeting on progress towards a pro-competitive framework including a review of regulatory arrangements, within and between jurisdictions, including those applying to third party access to gas pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed ANZMEC study on options for, and implications of, increasing use of natural gas, as outlined in the NGRS, will also be relevant. The ANZMEC study will include examination of the full costs of gas and alternatives and the potential for extending the reticulation systems, in particular on the urban fringe. It will also have regard to the cost risk to which Australia would be exposed, where the further expansion of electricity generation was derived exclusively from coal and a much greater effort becomes necessary to limit greenhouse gas emissions within the economic lifetimes of current power stations. An outline and directions for the study were noted by ANZMEC Ministers on 23 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 5: </EMPHASIS>That the Government examine ways in which the effect of gas price instability and the RRT (resource rent tax) on cogeneration schemes could be minimised. (Para 3.40)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No action required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RRT does not, and will not, impact on factors determining investment in cogeneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RRT facilitates the full commercial development of economic petroleum (oil and gas) resources. This is achieved because the RRT is based on profits rather than on levels of production. The RRT is therefore sensitive to changes in prices and costs. As a result a project does not pay RRT until it has covered its costs including a return for risk. In addition, the RRT's responsiveness removes the threat of premature closure of production when oil prices are low.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the introduction of the more efficient RRT, significant investment is now taking place in offshore Commonwealth waters. This is expected to provide incentives for the recovery of oil and gas that otherwise would not have been produced. New developments are under way in Bass Strait and off the coast of Western Australia while recent gas discoveries in the Otway Basin are encouraging. The outcome is that markets can be assured that long term stable supplies of petroleum will not be impeded or distorted by secondary taxation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The strong linkage between the RRT and natural gas prices assumed in the recommendation cannot be substantiated. A number of factors intervene between the RRT and the consumer to determine gas prices. These factors, which differ from one region to another, include the availability of gas, the presence of alternative energy supplies, production costs and the policies of State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, in Victoria a prime factor influencing natural gas prices to end consumers is the State Government's levy on the Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria&mdash;the Public Authority Contribution Charge (PAC). The PAC, which collected $265 million in 1991-92, is three to four times the RRT attributed to natural gas if passed on. The Victorian Government has the option of reducing this charge. Currently the average city gate gas price in Melbourne before the PAC is applied is about one third of the price in other cities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In light of these factors, the application of the RRT to petroleum production, including gas, will not inhibit the application of natural gas for cogeneration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to gas price instability, gas prices will continue to be determined by market forces. The Government has limited scope to influence pricing and it has no desire to formally regulate gas prices which in itself can lead to inefficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In future, price stability and transparency will be enhanced by improved national competition arrangements (as a result of the report by the Independent Committee of Inquiry into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Competition Policy</EMPHASIS>, chaired by Professor Fred Hilmer and released in August 1993) and due to an industry specific regulatory framework for interstate trade in gas designed to increase competition and efficiency in gas conveyancing by eliminating discriminatory pricing, pipeline monopoly abuse and removing impediments to third party access to gas pipelines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 2 June 1993 the Government announced its intention to develop a regulatory framework for interstate gas pipelines, including arrangements for pipeline access and a role for the Trade Practices Commission in arbitrating access disputes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 6: </EMPHASIS>The energy authorities vigorously pursue the possibilities of achieving emission reductions through such measures as shared reserve capacity. (Para 5.62)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sharing of reserve capacity is possible where there are strong interconnections across the transmission system sufficient to enable the transfer of power if required. At the present time, the non-interconnected States are required to maintain their own reserve capacity to cover any possible failure of their largest generating unit. The sharing of reserve capacity between linked systems has the potential to cut emissions through reduced fuel use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the tasks given to the NGMC by Heads of Governments is to examine the scope for upgrading the existing links between New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia and for new links between Victoria and Tasmania (Basslink) and between New South Wales and Queensland (Northlink). Although the feasibility studies for these various projects are being pursued by relevant States, the NGMC has been given a coordinating role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGMC has already reported to Heads of Government with regard to upgrading of the New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia interconnections. That report indicated that upgrading of the links was not economic until the latter part of the decade. The existing links are relatively small and are primarily used for opportunity interchanges of power. Their small capacity provide for only limited sharing of reserve capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent studies on Basslink indicate that the optimal timing is about the year 2000. With regard to Northlink, the technical feasibility of both DC and AC interconnections is currently being evaluated. Preliminary studies indicate economic justification before the end of the century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The upgrading of the existing links and the provisions of new links would provide greater opportunity for the sharing between interconnected States of spinning reserve, with consequent fuel savings and positive environmental benefits through reduced emissions. There would also be considerable economic benefits, as identified in the Committee's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 7:</EMPHASIS> Queensland not be included in the initial assessment of possible grid extensions and until it could be demonstrated that their inclusion can be achieved economically. (Para 5.64)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main concern of the Committee over the Northlink proposal derives from the view that transmission losses could erode the environmental benefits of the sharing of spinning reserve, with consequent fuel savings. The economic benefits of new links are addressed in response to Recommendation 6. However, such grid augmentations or extensions should only proceed where they can be demonstrated to be economic.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A major part of the assessment work being carried out by the States is to determine the economic merits of various proposals. At the present time Queensland is considering the construction of new generating capacity to meet the State's projected electricity needs from the end of the decade and beyond. The Commonwealth considers that this evaluation should also consider the merits of Northlink, which would enable the construction of expensive new capacity in Queensland to be delayed. The link would enable some of Queensland's power needs to be met by New South Wales which has considerable excess capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 8:</EMPHASIS> That the most appropriate structure (vertically integrated or separating generation, transmission and distribution) should be determined following an examination of systems in each State and their potential contribution to the national grid. (Para 6.42)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee did not support the separation of generation, transmission and distribution and more generally the pursuit of a competitive market model for the electricity supply industry, suggesting that the benefits of competition are based on theoretical models. Furthermore, it was suggested that competition would see environmental considerations ignored in favour of maximising returns on investment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's views are at odds with the direction of reform proposed and the views of Heads of Government. The desirability of a competitive market was recognised by all governments in Australia at an early stage of electricity industry reform. From the outset the NGMC, as required by Heads of Government, developed the Protocol and the market trading and transmission pricing proposals in a manner which supports the competitive market approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's position is also contrary to the Commonwealth's preferred reform options set out in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Electricity Strategy: A Discussion Paper</EMPHASIS> issued in May 1992. The Commonwealth in that paper argued that the adoption of certain structural reforms was the key to the establishment of a competitive generation sector. In this regard, it proposed the separation of transmission into a National Grid Corporation, independent of generation and distribution interests, as the first essential step in the development of a competitive market. The need for structural separation is clearly argued in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Electricity: A Strategy Discussion Paper</EMPHASIS>. It is worth reiterating that the Commonwealth considers that structural separation is a necessary prerequisite to ensure that there is open and fair competition between generation and transparency of charging for access to the transmission grid. It also removes potential conflicts of interest and the potential for cross subsidies between different sectors of the industry and provides the greatest level of certainty for new entrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As early as the 11 May 1992 Council of Australian Governments' Meeting, Heads of Government accepted the principle of separate generation and transmission elements in the electricity sector. This was reaffirmed at the 7 December 1992 CoAG meeting. It was made clear, in a subsequent letter from the Prime Minister to State and Territory leaders that separation went beyond mere ring fencing. It appears that this latter position was arrived at too late for the Committee to take into account in its report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recently, at the 8-9 June 1993 meeting of CoAG, in considering a report prepared by the NGMC on the structure of the transmission network, participating Heads of Government agreed to the establishment of the interstate transmission network through adoption of the Multiple Network Corporation model. This will effectively separate the transmission, generation and distribution functions. Governments have further agreed to work to have the Multiple Network Corporation structure in place by 1 July 1995, consistent with the NGMC timetable for the introduction of a competitive electricity market. Only South Australia and Tasmania have, at this stage, reserved their position pending further examination of the appropriateness of this structure for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have already taken steps to implement the decisions taken at the June CoAG meeting. The Victorian Government for instance, announced on 10 August that the State Electricity Commission of Victoria would be divided into three separate business enterprises comprising generation, transmission and distribution by 1 October 1993. In May 1993, the Queensland Government announced a restructuring of its electricity supply industry. The vertically integrated Queensland Electricity Commission is to be split into two Government owned corporations. One corporation will contain generation activities and the other transmission and distribution. The corporatisation process is due to be completed by 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's preferred option of a National Grid Corporation has not been closed off. Heads of Government have agreed to further examine, during the course of the establishment of the Multiple Network Corporation structure, whether the network structure for Governments to work towards should be a National Network Corporation or another option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concern expressed by the Committee that a competitive market will be detrimental to the achievement of environmental objectives appears misplaced. As discussed elsewhere, the Protocol indicates that the national grid will provide for the competitive sourcing of new capacity, including through demand management. Demand management has hitherto received only minor support from electricity authorities. Implementation of the Protocol principles should encourage the development of energy service companies providing demand side measures on a commercial basis. The competitive sourcing process, whether demand or supply side, will ensure least cost long-term solutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 9:</EMPHASIS> That as an expression of commitment to the reform process, the states give legislative force to the draft <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Grid Protocol</EMPHASIS>. (Para 6.61)</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported in principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of moves toward the development of a national electricity market, the Government acknowledges the benefits of national, uniform objectives and priorities for the electricity industry. This would be an effective means by which environmental objectives such as least cost planning, demand management and the other priorities identified by the Committee might be pursued.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The commitment of governments to micro-reform in the electricity supply industry is not in question. Governments have committed substantial resources to this end and are actively pursuing reform within the NGMC established by Heads of Government for that purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Grid Protocol</EMPHASIS>, published in December 1992, cannot be considered to be a final document. It has been developed having regard to assumptions about the present and possible future organisational environment for the industry. The Protocol will be subject to continual review and annual reporting, so that it will evolve as necessary, in accordance with principles agreed by Heads of Government. It is therefore a flexible document. To give the Protocol legislative force would pose unnecessary obstacles to further amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, nevertheless, aspects of the Protocol as well as other dimensions of the electricity reform agenda which will require passage of legislation. Clearly legislation will be required to effect structural reform and in respect of regulation required to govern certain aspects of behaviour of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Government's view, the Protocol will effectively perform the function of a national charter for the electricity supply industry. The Protocol, even at this early stage of its development, has provisions which address many of the priorities the Committee identified in its report as being important elements of the proposed national charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly it would, however, be inappropriate for such a charter to be applied to public utilities only. There is a growing trend toward private investment in the electricity supply industry, such as the partial sale of Loy Yang B in Victoria, the proposed purchase of the Gladstone power station by CRA and the proposal for the private construction of a power station at Collie in Western Australia; although this latter project may no longer proceed on the basis of private ownership. It is important, therefore, that the Protocol be applicable to both the public and private sector to ensure competitive neutrality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to regulation, the overall objective is that it should be as light handed as possible, with the extent of the required regulation diminishing as competition develops, particularly at the generation level. Regulation needs to be cost effective, transparent, and with a uniform and independent national approach to be adopted. Electricity supply arrangements in the States already involve substantial regulation in various forms. The implementation of a competitive national electricity market is a complex process which will require underpinning by a regulatory framework which will be particularly important in regard to the natural monopoly sectors of the industry. Regulation will be required in a number of areas. These include technical regulation to ensure reliability of system operation; appropriate safety standards to ensure adequate public and workplace safety; environmental regulation to minimise environmental impacts; regulation of market access and market behaviour to sustain and foster competition, including from renewables, and to provide an alternative to competition through determination of arrangements and pricing in the monopoly areas of the industry; and regulation over the financial transfers between market participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development of appropriate regulatory arrangements for the electricity industry is being progressed by an NGMC working group. The working group has prepared an issues paper which was published in July 1993 to assist the process of public consultation. After consideration of the comments and submissions put forward in response to the issues paper, the NGMC will develop a report for governments with recommendations on the regulatory options for a nationally competitive electricity market. This is to be completed for the next meeting of CoAG (end 1993). The NGMC is conscious of the report of the Independent Committee of Inquiry into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Competition Policy</EMPHASIS> chaired by Professor Hilmer and released in August 1993, which is likely to have a direct impact on the regulatory requirements in the electricity industry. The NGMC will take full account of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Competition Policy</EMPHASIS> report in preparing its recommendations for governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 10:</EMPHASIS> That this legislative guarantee (the Protocol) open access to the grid and include a mechanism through which demand side measures for making blocks of power available are incorporated into the bidding system. (Para 6.61)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 14:</EMPHASIS> That if they have not already done so, authorities and responsible State Government Ministers closely examine methods of reconciling corporate objectives and demand side measures. (Para 7.61)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee indicated that one of its key concerns is that participants are guaranteed open access to the grid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential feature of the proposed competitive market developed by the NGMC, as described and set out in the Protocol, is that provision is to be made for non-discriminatory access to the grid by private and public generators and customers. It will enable all participants to be able to freely trade in bulk electricity through the national grid. While the Protocol states that to be a participant, generators must have a capacity of at least 30 MW, and customers must have a demand of 10 MW each, smaller modules, including renewables and demand-side measures, will be encouraged outside the Protocol. The initial limits applying to participants will be reviewed in the light of operating experience. Appropriate regulatory mechanisms will ensure that the market trading arrangements are fair for all participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At its meeting on 8-9 June 1993, Heads of Government called for the NGMC to prepare, for consideration by CoAG at its next meeting, a report on demand management opportunities. This was welcomed by the Government. The Government will, through its membership of the NGMC, be pressing for more attention to be given to how demand management can be encouraged within the national grid system to satisfactorily meet economic and environmental objectives. The Government will work to ensure that demand management measures are adopted that are in the best interests of consumers and the wider community. Equally, other environmental matters, including least cost planning, renewable energy and cogeneration will also be pursued in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Protocol indicates that in the national grid there are to be guidelines for the competitive sourcing of new capacity through demand side measures. It is proposed that new capacity, whether on the demand or the supply side, will be evaluated on an integrated basis which will aim to achieve lowest cost for electricity across the national grid over the long term. The Protocol thus acknowledges the need for a nationally focussed approach to demand side planning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does recognise, however, that the precise mechanisms by which demand side bidding will be incorporated in the market arrangements were not detailed in the NGMC paper <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Transition to a National Electricity Market</EMPHASIS> of July 1993. One of the Commonwealth's main objectives is to ensure satisfactory arrangements for demand side bidding which provides the scope for reductions in present levels of power consumption. It is important, nevertheless, that demand bidding be an economic decision. Grid participants, in meeting their need for power should be able to take into account the bids of both generators and companies providing demand side services. The objective is that the proposed spot market should be able to accommodate demand side bidding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government acknowledges that a number of State utilities have developed significant demand management programs in recent years and that these programs have proved quite successful. One of the reasons for this is that demand management programs can postpone the very significant capital investment needed to increase generating capacity in order to meet future demand projections. In this way economic and environmental incentives can work in the same direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed separation of generation, transmission and distribution may see further increases in the adoption of demand management. Responsibility for demand management appears to fall most naturally to distributors, which, as part of a least cost planning approach to supplying customers, would be able to sell both supply and demand services. Distributors would no longer be constrained by broader corporate goals. Indeed, moves in this direction have already commenced. Sydney Electricity, the largest distribution authority in New South Wales recently announced it has established a new business venture, Sydney Electricity Energy Services, in partnership with energy management consultant Enman Pty Ltd, to provide demand management services, covering all forms of energy, not just electricity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 11: </EMPHASIS>That the State Governments take action to expand the membership of the NGMC to include representation from industry and community groups, including trade union, environmental and consumer groups, and persons with expertise in demand management and environmental matters. (Para 6.63)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is committed to pursuing this objective through its membership on the NGMC. The Commonwealth has always been of the view that the membership of the NGMC should be expanded to include the key parties and sectors which have a valid interest in the reform outcome. This position is consistent with the Commonwealth's view as outlined in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Electricity Strategy: A Discussion Paper</EMPHASIS> which called for the evolution of the NGMC into a more broadly-based National Electricity Industry Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NGMC was established by Heads of Government to report to them and that membership of the Council is subject to their joint agreement. Any change to the current membership is therefore something which the Commonwealth cannot progress unilaterally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has sought, at every appropriate opportunity, to press upon other members of the NGMC the need to expand membership as a matter of priority. At the Council of Australian Governments meeting on 8-9 June 1993, the Minister for Resources, the Hon Michael Lee, MP proposed that the membership of the NGMC be expanded to include a customer, union and distributor representative. The proposal was opposed by a number of States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the absence of what the Government would regard to be satisfactory membership of the NGMC, the reaffirmation by Heads of Government of the need for the NGMC to consult widely and visibly with major stakeholders was welcomed. The Commonwealth strongly supports the need for extensive and meaningful consultation in the process of developing proposals, particularly with key parties such as industry, and will work to ensure that this occurs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of an expanded membership is, nevertheless, one of a number of issues that are to be further discussed at the next CoAG meeting to be held later this year. The matter is likely to be dealt with in the context of the three year review of the performance and organisational structure of the NGMC, scheduled to be completed by July 1994. It was decided that the parameters of this review would be agreed at the next CoAG meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government welcomes the decision taken by the NGMC at its meeting of 23 June 1993 to establish a consultative committee comprising representatives of non utility grid participants to provide analysis and advice from their perspective on matters relevant to the development of a competitive interstate electricity market. This committee will offer an opportunity to involve, on a more formal basis than exists at present, other industry stakeholders in the Council's reform program. Draft Terms of Reference have been prepared for the committee which is expected to comprise 10 to 15 people. NGMC members have been asked to nominate possible representatives for inclusion on the committee. For its part, the Commonwealth has nominated a business, union, distributor and environmental representative for inclusion on the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 13: </EMPHASIS>That this level of transparency (publication of comprehensive reports about activities and tabling of an annual report) be increased through the establishment in each State Parliament of a Parliamentary Committee to scrutinise the operations of energy authorities and to consider any major initiatives or changes in policy direction. (Para 7.31)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Noted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale for the Committee's recommendation flows from its view that there is a need for greater transparency and accountability for utility operations. This recommendation is essentially a matter for State Government consideration. The Government has a broad interest in the micro-economic reform of the electricity supply and gas industries as well as specific interests with respect to the Snowy Mountains Scheme and the Pipeline Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth policy in regard to its own Government Business Enterprises (GBE) is clear and generally consistent with the Committee's views. Each GBE should have a clear mandate and set of objectives which include any requirements to meet explicitly stated Government social and economic objectives. Community Service Obligations should be specified and met at minimum cost. The cost of all CSOs must be transparent, and new CSOs normally met from the Budget. CSOs are discussed further in relation to Recommendation 15.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has a policy of removing when practical special advantages and disadvantages that apply to its business enterprises by virtue of government ownership. Effect was given to this view in the May 1988 Economic Statement when the Government announced that the exemption of Commonwealth businesses from Commonwealth, State and local government taxes and charges would be phased out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The application of taxes and charges, national competition policy and other competitive conduct norms to State Government Business Enterprises was considered in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Competition Policy</EMPHASIS> report. The report provides an opportunity for the States and Commonwealth to jointly consider a national policy. The Commonwealth will be seeking an outcome which enhances the ability of private cogeneration, new technologies and demand management options to compete in the supply of electrical power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the operation of the Snowy Mountains Scheme, this has been the subject of a tripartite review by the relevant governments. Significant progress has already been made in the reform progress. All three governments recognise that the current legislative and other arrangements governing operation of the Scheme are unsatisfactory and outdated and stand in the way of maximising efficiency. The intention is that the Scheme be corporatised to improve its overall performance and efficiency and to improve competition in the south east Australian electricity market. At the June 1993 CoAG meeting, senior officials were asked to report back to Heads of Government on progress in the resolution of reform arrangements for the Scheme, underlining the importance attached to this task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the present time, all public electricity authorities, and the Snowy Mountains Authority, provide comprehensive annual reports on their activities which are actively scrutinised in the normal course of government business. From time to time, the utilities also prepare more specialised reports on specific aspects of their activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All governments, as part of their participation in the NGMC process, are being required to actively consider the implications for their electricity supply industries of the introduction of a competitive market in eastern and southern Australia. This has meant that the utilities have come under public and political scrutiny to an unparalleled extent. All governments, as part of broad structural and efficiency reform initiatives, have either completed or are in the process of comprehensively reviewing the future structure, function and operating parameters of their electricity supply industries. Even Western Australia, which is not a participant on the NGMC process, has recently undertaken a review of its electricity supply industry. The individual reviews being conducted by the States complements the work being done by the NGMC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the electricity supply industry, having been identified as a target for micro-economic reform, has been the subject of extensive performance monitoring in the recent past. For instance, the Industry Commission report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Energy Generation and Distribution</EMPHASIS> was released in May 1991, this was followed by a research report by the Bureau of Industry Economics (BIE) International Performance Indicators: Electricity in February 1992. A contribution to the BIE study was made by the Business Council of Australia which commissioned a study by Swan Consultants <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">An International Benchmark for Australia's Electricity Supply Industry</EMPHASIS> (November 1991). The Electricity Supply Association of Australia (ESAA) on 20 August released its study Measuring the Efficiency of the Australian Electricity Supply Industry. An international bench-marking study is to be released by the ESAA shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The utilities will not escape from the need for comprehensive performance monitoring and reporting after the establishment of the competitive electricity market. The Protocol indicates that a monitoring and reporting system will be established in order to provide the national and international comparisons needed to assess the effectiveness of the organisational arrangements. The reporting system is to provide appropriate measures of grid performance. The precise performance indicators are yet to be fully developed by the NGMC. It is appropriate that, with the development of a national market, the reporting requirements are developed on a consistent national basis, for both private and public participants in the grid, to ensure competitive neutrality and a common basis for comparison to enable appropriate bench-marking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 15: </EMPHASIS>That governments make separately identified provision to meet these (community service) obligations. (Para 7.68)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pricing policies of utilities are often designed by governments to meet objectives other than efficiency. These policies require utilities to fund a range of community service obligations (CSOs), which frequently involve the subsidisation of particular classes of consumers, and this leads to inappropriate tariff structures. In general in Australia, industrial and small commercial consumers tend to cross subsidise domestic consumers. The imposition of uniform customer tariffs across customer classes also results in urban consumers subsidising rural consumers. As a consequence, energy prices may not reflect the full cost of production and supply. This has hindered the development of alternative energy technologies, for example stand-alone remote area systems, especially those based on renewables. An alternative approach for utilities might be the provision of serviced stand-alone remote area power systems to meet the needs of customers in these areas. Such stand alone power systems may be more cost effective than new transmission line extensions and as well as reducing the cost of meeting CSOs to these customers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the process of micro-economic reform, governments need to examine ways to remove impediments to the development of alternative energy sources so that energy prices can more fully reflect costs of supply, for example by eliminating cross-subsidies on remote area grid connections and removing any requirement for uniform state-wide electricity prices. If social objectives are considered essential, the associated costs could be met by way of direct appropriations from governments rather than indirectly through utilities: moreover such an approach has the advantage of being more transparent. Alternatively, the cost of CSOs could be explicitly identified in balance sheets, with returns to Governments being reduced by an equivalent amount. Regardless of the methodology adopted for meeting the cost of CSOs, they should be explicitly and transparently identified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 16: </EMPHASIS>That an evaluation process be undertaken about the effect of foreign ownership of Australia's electricity generation infrastructure and whether this is in Australia's longer term economic and strategic interests. (Para 7.89)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the present time the only foreign owned electricity infrastructure in Australia is a 51% share of Loy Yang B in Victoria by Mission Energy of the US, the remainder is in public hands. About six per cent of Australia's electricity is generated by private firms for their own use and for public supply in remote areas. There is no information on the degree of foreign ownership of this portion of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's foreign investment policy is framed and administered with a view to encouraging foreign investment and ensuring that such investment is consistent with the needs of the community. The Government recognises the substantial contribution foreign investment makes to the development of Australia's industries and resources. Capital from other countries supplements domestic savings and provides scope for higher rates of economic activity and employment. Foreign capital also provides access to new technology, management skills and overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is in a position to maintain a watching brief over any increases in foreign ownership of electricity generation infrastructure. All foreign investment proposals to acquire existing businesses with assets in excess of $50 million are examined by the Foreign Investment Review Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 19: </EMPHASIS>That ERDC set up a working group in connection with the ESAA to identify means to encourage the commercialisation of renewable energy technologies, and in doing so to pay specific attention to the potential for local manufacturing and export. (Para 9.52)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the first phase of the NGRS, governments are committed to expanding the use of renewable energy sources in generating electricity wherever there are suitable opportunities, and to increasing support for energy research, development and demonstration, particularly of renewable energies. ANZMEC has been delegated to investigate the scope to promote commercialisation of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies in the industrial and commercial sectors. The Government will pursue this action through its membership of ANZMEC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Energy Research and Development Corporation (ERDC) supports this recommendation. ERDC is currently developing a renewable energy research strategy that aims to bring together and help focus the direction of its and industries' investment in renewables, as part of the total energy mix for the future. In doing so ERDC is liaising with relevant industry groups such as the Electricity Supply Association of Australia (ESAA) and the Australian and New Zealand Solar Energy Society on an informal basis. A number of joint research projects with ESAA and the utilities are under way. The ERDC is also liaising with the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development which is presently preparing an industry development strategy in consultation with the renewable energy industry. This strategy will focus on the employment and wealth creation and export potential opportunities that increased global environmental concerns are providing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with its commitment to increase support for renewable energy research, development and demonstration, the Government will follow up on ERDC's renewable energy research strategy once it is completed. Before any financial or other incentives can be given to industry to manufacture renewable energy technologies, there will need to be sufficient preliminary research into the economic viability of the particular technology.</PARA>

In practice, this is rarely interpreted as `ecologically sustainable'. In fact, the chairperson's report does not mention the word, and I heard on the grapevine that he actually does not like his staff mentioning it either. So we have a report that is supposed to be dealing with research on the environment that does not seem to believe in ecological sustainability. It would be good to have the mission amended so that it has a greater ecological base. The water programs have a greater ecological component than the land programs, which tend to be more about stability of productivity rather than ecological sustainability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation interprets its scope under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act as being supportive of existing primary industry. There is rarely acknowledgment of the need to examine whether such industries can be sustainable, let alone assumptions that changing practices will make them sustainable regardless of climatic, geographical, economic or biological constraints&mdash;that is, there is no questioning of the dominant production-based paradigm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation recognises the need for research and development in sociological and economic aspects of primary production, but has not necessarily translated this into research dollars. There is still a tendency for the technological fix. The corporation recognises the need for integrated, multi-disciplinary and multi-regional approaches. Unfortunately, this tends to be difficult in practice given the cultural barriers between nature conservation and primary production agencies, the institutional barriers between states and so on. The corporation is doing a reasonable job of forcing agencies and people together, but there are external constraints that are difficult to overcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An amount of $10.4 million from the Commonwealth government is not all that much to address research and development in all areas of ecological sustainability across the nation. While there has been considerable success in levying money in other areas, a number of other rural research and development corporations are not paying sufficient attention to ecological sustainability. Some additional funds may be gained through a direct levy on producers, which would be of great assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still difficulties in coordinating research with the extension and adoption of programs, especially given the new delivery mechanisms for the national landcare program. The corporation considers research priorities, programs and projects well in advance to assist institutional planning. It requires that all research projects have an adoption component and is willing to find some or all of this. However, researchers have no way of ensuring that research priorities will have their adoption or extension components recommended for funding by regional or state based processes. This has been looked at, but not at the state level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The corporation has done a reasonable job at ensuring that all projects and programs funded have a well thought out adoption and communication plan included and implemented. Some areas of research and development that tend to fall through the cracks are weeds, alternative land management, and inland rivers and waterways. But some of these are considered marginal issues. There is a long way to go and perhaps the major complaint that the Greens would have is that it is time we took the potential that we have with such a research and development corporation and translated it into action based on real ecological sustainability. It is also time to accept that we need to take action soon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">The government and the Law Reform Commission are to be congratulated, firstly, for the reference and, secondly, for this report. Significant problems have been identified by the report. Primarily, the report identifies the difficulty of women obtaining access to justice. There are structural problems embedded in the system of justice in Australia which militate against women obtaining due and proper access. For example, the paradigm for self-defence is based on a bar-room brawl, which is not appropriate for women endeavouring to protect themselves and their children. Similarly, premeditation as a factor that aggravates an offence is one that has a gender bias in its interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even when there is formal equality, the lacunae in the legal system often result in women suffering. This is most apparent in the area of domestic violence. Traditional legal mechanisms have not afforded protection against domestic  violence. From the material in this interim report it is clear that more needs to be done, both in the law and the mechanisms of access to and enforcement of the law. The Greens (WA) support the recommendation of the Australian Law Reform Commission that a national women's justice program be established. We see this as a priority and call on the government to ensure that funds are made available in this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens (WA) also look forward to further reports of the Australian Law Reform Commission on this reference and note that proper recognition and responses to the legal problems of women can occur only when women are adequately represented at all levels of the legal system, including the legislature. </PARA>

<PARA>Recent statements by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) about his wish to abolish the proportional representation system in the Senate is the talk of a would-be emperor determined to achieve absolute power. However, he has been careful to dress up this grab for power in the trappings of democracy, claiming that this house was historically conceived solely as a states' house, that it is unrepresentative and that it is driven by the ambition to usurp the responsibilities of the executive. These are accusations he made on 3 March of this year when he answered a question from the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Mack), who asked whether it was his desire to alter the proportional voting system&mdash;no doubt a very handy dorothy dixer at the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go behind the rhetoric and look at the historic facts, we see that the Prime Minister is quite obviously wrong. This house was not conceived solely as a states' house. With regard to his claim that the Senate is undemocratic, he would do well to look at the facts. Far from usurping the rights of the executive, this house and my party, the Australian Democrats, are committed to ensuring that the executive remains accountable. This is, of course, the nub of the question. What really irks Mr Keating and what motivates all his utterances on the proportional representation issue is the Senate's determination to hold this government accountable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the Prime Minister would like the Democrats to just roll over when his ministers throw away public money with gay abandon at election time. I am sure he would want this house to ignore secret deals done with media organisations to ensure `balanced' coverage at election times. I am sure he would like a less powerful Auditor-General's office. I am sure he would like to prepare his budget without proper consultation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed he would. Like other arrogant leaders, he would like to rule without those features of government which make a system responsible. Like a ruler in a totalitarian regime, he would prefer to rule by edict rather than by legislation. I believe he has forgotten that he is a servant rather than the master of the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the Senate that the voice of government is heard. Mr Keating's talk of changing the proportional system is his attempt at ensuring that that voice is silenced. I am confident that this house and the people of Australia will not allow this to happen. After 10 years of the Senate providing an effective check on government, it is hard to imagine that the community would want a Senate without the Democrats exercising independent scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's rhetoric about the Senate usurping the privileges of the executive is in fact doublespeak for the Senate exercising its role as a true house of review. That role not only means that government is held accountable for its shortcomings and failures, but also that the government's legislation is scrutinised and assessed on its merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a house of review, the Senate has a record of which it can be justly proud. The figures are revealing. Mr John Uhr, a senior lecturer at the ANU, has done some interesting analysis of the way legislation has been dealt with in this house. Of the 1,850 bills which have been passed by both houses in the 10 years between 1983 and 1993, around 20 per cent have been amended by the Senate. Some 5,000 amendments have been moved; some 1,055 were successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, one can safely assume that a large proportion of the 1,950 amendments moved by the government were either inspired by the Democrats and Independents or were introduced to forestall or accommodate amendments we had foreshadowed. These figures do not represent the process of obstruction by non-government parties, but are a record of these parties contributing constructively to the improvement of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Examples of Democrat amendments are as diverse as capping Medicare costs for chronically ill people, including mentally ill people in disability legislation; protecting hard-pressed farmers from a further toughening of the assets tests; and prohibiting discrimination in employment on the grounds of age, disability and sexual preference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contributions to the formulation of policy made by the Senate committee system is also evidence of the constructive role played by the Senate in the legislative system. Indeed, the Senate has done its most constructive and reputable work in the area of legislative scrutiny, with an emphasis on civil liberties through such committees as that on delegated legislation, the scrutiny of bills committee, the legal and constitutional affairs committee and others, protecting the community against Mr Keating's sometimes very high-handed legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Eliminating the Australian Democrats and Independents will have one of two results: either a rubber stamp Senate, which is controlled by the government, or a Senate dominated by the opposition, causing confrontational stand-offs and constitutional instability, as in 1975. Indeed, members of the Liberal Party have not excluded supporting Mr Keating, obviously in the hope that they will enjoy the spoils of absolute power when their turn comes. I was present at the meeting with Mr Downer when he suggested that if we do not support the opposition on budget legislation, this might indeed be the course of action that the opposition parties will take. </PARA>

However, such a change, if it were supported by both major parties&mdash;which I am sure are both itching to get their hands on the lever of absolute power&mdash;would disfranchise the more than 20 per cent of people who cannot bring themselves to vote for either of the old parties and remove effective scrutiny of government action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the other aspect of the Democrats role: to represent the people deeply concerned about the environment; peace issues; poverty here and overseas; unemployment; the rights of minority groups&mdash;Aboriginal people, sole parents, ethnic people, the disabled, the mentally ill, and people who are different such as the gay and lesbian community; and, indeed, about the government's responsibility to take action on economic and social issues to redress these failures of what should be, but is not, good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's assertion that the Senate is an unrepresentative house conveniently ignores how successful the proportional representation system has been in ensuring that the popular vote has been reflected in actual representation in the Senate, in contrast to the inequities of the single member preferential system adopted in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 11 years that the Labor government has been in power, not once has the Labor government won a majority of votes. Its largest share was 49.5 per cent in 1983. In 1990 it dropped to 39.4 per cent. In 1987 and 1990 the ALP was out-polled by the coalition. Last year's elections saw 45 per cent of the vote return 54 per cent of the seats. There is not much support here for Mr Keating's claim that the House of Representatives is a truly representative house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should compare this to the vote of the minor parties at the last election. The Greens (WA), Democrats and others who polled 12 per cent in the Senate vote got 10 per cent of the seats. In the House of Representatives election the same grouping polled 10 per cent of the vote and got just over one per cent of the seats. These figures speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's analysis of the history of the Senate is typically ideologically driven. It is well known that the design of the Senate repeatedly gave rise to some of the most bitter disputes during the 1890s conventions. However, it is a misrepresentation that those debates were simply about how to entrench state powers in the Senate. It is more accurate to say that they were directed at three things: setting up a house of review in a federal structure; ensuring accountability of the executive; and providing for a system of proportional representation that would reflect popular political sentiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The element of proportional representation was crucial to the framers' design so that the Senate, by representing minority interests, would provide the checks and balances expected of a house of review. Indeed, Edmund Barton and Alfred Deakin were two of the framers who voiced strong support for the concept of proportional representation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the first Commonwealth electoral bill introduced in 1902 provided for proportional representation for Senate elections and optional preferential voting for the House of Representatives. It was only after the first of the political deals that have characterised the history of proportional representation was done that a system of simple majority was adopted for both houses. This was over the advice of the government of the day that proportional representation was the only way to prevent the Senate becoming a clone of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention briefly a possible amendment foreshadowed by Senator Kemp which would suggest that my motion would include the statement that the representation of all states should be equal. We know that this is anchored in the constitution; we also know that the Senate does not operate as a states' house any more. While we do not suggest that this particular provision should be overturned, we are somewhat reluctant to accept it as a principle that should be enshrined forever. The Australian Democrats believe that there may be scope in the future to move towards regional government, for instance. Therefore, while we strongly believe that the Senate should always be elected by proportional representation, the representation of each state need not at all times in the future be equal, and certainly we should not commit ourselves at this point in time to that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe it is quite on the cards that as the constitutional reform process in this country moves forward, while we should always ensure that the Senate is elected by proportional representation and remains a proper check on the government, the position of individual states should remain an open issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note the absurdity of the results that the defeat of the framers' intentions has achieved. For example, in 1934 a united Australia Party-Country Party coalition and the ALP divided the Senate by 33 to three. In 1946 the ALP government and the Liberal-Country Party divided the Senate in reverse order. It should be remembered that it was the ALP which, in 1948, saw the light and changed the system back to that envisaged by the framers of the constitution and introduced proportional representation. I do not say that it was done for elevated political reasons&mdash;the government was facing defeat at the polls&mdash;but what I do say is that it introduced a system the framers of the constitution always envisaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the main issue in this debate remains that the Senate should be preserved as a democratic check on government. Even people who do not always agree with our policies might oppose Mr Keating's push to get rid of the Democrats and turn the Senate into a rubber stamp. If they do, they should make it clear to Mr Keating that accountability to the community is essential for democratic government. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you that this is not an obstructionist Senate. I believe that quite the reverse argument applies. For example, there is the contentious issue of sports rorts. There was a proposal before this chamber to have an inquiry into that. Again, the minor parties joined with the government and prevented that inquiry. The government was able to achieve an historic victory for the trade unions. I think it was a bad victory from our perspective and the perspective of employers and future employment in this country. After 10 years of trying, the government, with the cooperation of the Democrats and the Greens, managed to remove sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act. Despite all  its attempts in the previous decade, it was not able to achieve this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument can be mounted&mdash;it is the argument that I am mounting&mdash;that this chamber has been exceedingly cooperative with the government. Yet despite this, Mr Keating cannot brook any challenge at all to his authority. He is not only the most abusive Prime Minister in Australian history; he is probably the most thin-skinned as well. The mere fact that the Senate wishes to debate the legislation he brings forward, the mere fact that the Senate wishes to hold the government more accountable, has led to the spleen Mr Keating has shown against the Senate and to the abuse he has heaped on the Senate. His latest proposal is to change the voting pattern in the Senate to remove any impediment to his capacity to impose his will on the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I really cannot believe that Senator Richardson is sincere. The Senate has been more than cooperative with his government, yet still this is not sufficient for him. In another time in another place the great Winston Churchill warned about `a handful of men getting hold of the state machine, having the right to make people do what suits their party, their personal interests or doctrines'. Churchill may well have been speaking this day in this country about this Labor Party. There is no question that Mr Keating and his senior colleagues would like to embark on a constitutional upheaval without parallel in Australian history. The aim of the Keating government is to remove any capacity of our institutions to effectively query or challenge his ambitions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first item on his agenda is the abolition of the constitutional monarchy. Mr Keating does not want an independent Governor-General; he wants a compliant president. The second item on his agenda, which he has largely achieved, is to strip the House of Representatives of its few remaining powers to force government accountability. He has largely  achieved this goal. Mr Keating is the first Prime Minister in 93 years who does not feel that he has to attend question time. All the Prime Ministers that have gone before him have assumed, as we have all assumed, that question time was a vital part of the institution of parliament in which the government could be questioned. Mr Keating has stripped, in large part, the House of Representatives of that capacity. He has shown a remarkable capacity to humiliate the current Speaker of the House of Representatives and to destroy that particular institution as one which can lay claim to any independence whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item on Mr Keating's agenda is to abolish the Senate or, if this cannot be done immediately, at least to destroy its capacity to review government actions. The fourth item on his agenda is to destroy the federal system and the capacity of the states to act in an independent fashion. He wants Australia to be ruled from Canberra unchallenged. The Democrats, not surprisingly, want their role in our democracy to be protected. I address these remarks particularly to Senator Spindler, who is with us in the chamber. Senator Spindler has made a plea&mdash;and many of the arguments he has put forward we would not quarrel with&mdash;that there be a role in our constitutional system for the minor parties.</PARA>

Senator Spindler's motion, of course, is to the effect that the Senate wishes to retain the proportional voting system and also to protect the role of the states.

In the time available to me I would like to concentrate on some of the aspects raised by Senator Kemp. Also, as a newly arrived senator in this place, I have some particular aspects I wish to raise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kemp indicated, the Senate, in fulfilling the historic role assigned to it in the Australian constitution, has functioned as a house of review. Indeed, even in my short time in the Senate this house has not stood aside from its role of scrutinising and, at times, opposing government policy. To have a chamber that is simply a reflection of government power in the House of Representatives would not be a desirable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have the Senate acting as a house of review in which government measures are scrutinised closely, may be sent to a committee, and legislative measures which are seen as impacting too harshly on particular groups in the community may be modified, is indeed a central part of the Australian system of government. To change the present role of the Senate and to introduce measures such as those which have been indicated by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that is, to have single-member Senate-type electorates in each state, would indeed change the whole notion of the Senate. It would no longer be possible to discuss wider implications of legislation as it is presented to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would particularly like to develop this notion of single-member Senate electorates as foreshadowed by Mr Keating. If we are to proceed with this proposal, a senator&mdash;or a member, as they would then be known&mdash;would represent part of the state rather than the whole state. In rural areas in particular this would mean that the members or senators would then become inexorably tied to the regional interests of their electorate and would be unable to take a wider interest in areas such as foreign affairs, international trade and other global matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have a country background, because of my position as a senator for the state of Victoria it is possible for me to have my electorate office in the north-western industrial suburb of Broadmeadows. Through that I can take a much wider interest in areas of Victoria that I would not be able to take a great interest in if I were tied to a particular electorate or part of that state. For that reason alone I oppose Mr Keating's proposed changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Kemp outlined, Mr Keating's reasons for opposition to the Senate and his desire to change the Senate are well known. I will develop that point later on, if I have time. I would also like to point out that, much as I and the government may not agree with the points of view put forward by the minority parties, they nevertheless represent particular points of view held by a certain proportion of the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister, in his remarks of 3 March in the House of Representatives, referred to the essential, robust element of our democracy as being the representative nature of the Australian ballot. Under the present system, the minor parties hold a number of seats allocated to them under the proportional representation system. So we have with us the Greens (WA) and the Australian Democrats because that is the way the Australian people have chosen to vote. Those two parties bring to the Senate a reflection of the way many people in Australia think. As I have said, although I may not agree with the points of view of the minority parties, I nevertheless uphold their right to be represented in the Senate because they have achieved a certain proportion of the Australian vote. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of the Senate was underlined by the changes made to the budget last year. As Senator Kemp indicated, although the budget was not thrown out and not dismantled, through the presence in the Senate of minority parties and the coalition we were able to achieve modifications to that budget which made it impact less harshly on some members of the community. Mr Keating simply wants to push legislation through the Senate, regardless of the feelings of minority groups about issues such as the republic and changing the flag. He cannot bear to see anyone stand in his way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, on 3 March the Prime Minister also referred to the Senate as `a spoiling chamber'. That is indeed an extremely derogatory remark about an institution that has certainly stood the test of time. Mr Keating has called senators `paragons of democratic virtue', when what senators are doing is representing their states' and their constituents' interests. In that never to be forgotten phrase, the Prime Minister also called senators `unrepresentative swill'. On the same day, he referred to this house as holding any government to ransom over budget measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, this house acts as a house of review. It enables legislation to be scrutinised very closely. In any democratic country there must be a mechanism for review. All Australian states except Queensland have retained their upper house. Even in Victoria during the excesses of the Kirner-Carr government in the 10 years between 1982 and 1992, the fact that the upper house&mdash;the Legislative Council&mdash;was not government dominated meant that those excesses were at least restrained and that there was some brake on the economic mismanagement which the Labor government brought to Victoria during that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not talk for very much longer than that, but I cannot guarantee that I will keep it quite that short. The point I should make at the outset is that most of the contributions to the debate on these motions so far seem to be premised on the assumption that the government has made a decision and is determined to go down the path of legislating to seek to change the voting system for this place. I make it very clear at the outset that the government has made no such decision. We have no current plans to do anything of the kind. But I should also say that we are certainly considering whether the place might not be made to work better by a change in electoral arrangements which would ensure that the government of the day, properly elected, is able to govern. What kind of electoral arrangements might guarantee that outcome is a matter for very considerable debate and quite a deal of uncertainty. But it is a real issue that needs to be considered, and it needs to be considered because there are problems at the moment in the way the Senate is operating and, indeed, our whole system of government is operating as a result of the role of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me spell out what those problems are. The first is the way the numbers are falling out these days in this chamber.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And negativity and general bloody-mindedness. Let me say something about democracy Senate style. If the Senate were a states house, as it was intended by the founding fathers to be, there would be something to be said for equal numbers of senators coming from each state with that being translated into the way in which the place is conducted. Once the Senate loses any rationale as a states house&mdash;which it really did in its very first session at the beginning of this century&mdash;immediately there is a much less obvious rationale for equality of numbers from each state. That is a constitutional matter; it is not something that could be changed by legislation. It is certainly not something that I am expressing any view about. I just make the point that, once we accept the reality that this is a party house and always has been a party house, there is infinitely less justification for the threshold requirements of the constitution applying in the way that they do and introducing the electoral biases they do than would otherwise be the case if this were genuinely a states house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point to make about the way in which the Senate numbers are operating at the moment is that the proportional representation system viewed constituency by constituency or, in this case, state by state tends to create overall a greater approximation between the number of votes a party or group gets on the one hand and the number of seats into which that is translated on the other. That just follows arithmetically from the reality of a proportional representation system. To that extent it is sometimes argued that the PR system is more democratic in a way than a system of single member constituencies. The way in which the PR system operates in Australia and the way in which things work out when we look at the voting returns as a whole all over the country demonstrate some very great idiosyncrasies indeed and a very conspicuous failure to match the notion that numbers of votes are translated into numbers of seats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking into account the 4.6 million votes the Labor Party received at the last Senate election, with 43 1/2 per cent of the vote, also taking into account the effect of the earlier election, and similarly taking into account the 4.5 million votes that the coalition parties received, each of us has got roughly the kind of percentage of seats that follows from that sort of percentage of the vote. I do not contest that analysis. It is complicated by the fact that the present Senate is the product of two elections, not one, so that we in the government are sitting in here with reduced numbers as compared with the numbers on the other side, with a situation where we have only 30 people in the Senate as compared with the opposition's 36. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The real point that I want to make is that at the last election&mdash;if we leave aside the impact of the earlier vote&mdash;we got a higher percentage of the votes, 43 1/2 per cent, than did the opposition with around 43 per cent. Yet, we are sitting in here, as a result of the staggered system of election, with considerably fewer seats than the opposition. On the last occasion the electorate had to reflect its views of who should be governing the country, that was not translated into the number of seats that presently exist here. That is just a point made in passing, with no great portentous significance attached to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It can work the other way&mdash;election by election it has in the past. What is harder to accept, and is an aberration of democratic principles&mdash;and what I would like the opposition to think long and hard about because it will be, perhaps at some stage in the next 25 years or so, the beneficiary of this particular system&mdash;is the way in which it operates so far as minority parties are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us contemplate the situation that prevails here in the Senate. The balance of power for all practical purposes is being exercised by three people whom the opposition needs to join with to constitute a majority&mdash;the two Greens and Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine comes in here with 32,000 votes&mdash;one-third of one per cent of the total number of people voting in the last Senate election. He is occupying a very pivotal seat. The Greens have the grand total between them, in terms of direct primary votes for the Western Australian Greens at the last election, of 53,000, although I know that Senator Chamarette inherited Senator Vallentine's seat and Senator Vallentine, let it be acknowledged, had 76,000 primary votes when she was elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As compared with the nearly five million primary votes that the Labor Party had and the 4 1/2 million or so that the coalition had at the last election, the Greens are sitting there with the grand sum of 53,000 primary votes&mdash;carry over the 76,000 from the previous election to be generous&mdash;barely one per cent of the vote in the whole Australian electorate. Senator Harradine is sitting there with 0.3 of one per cent of the vote; and here they are exercising the power to, in effect, run the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not as if there is any guaranteed majority in terms of overall votes built into this. People say, `The Greens and Senator Harradine can only exercise the authority they have by voting with the opposition'. That is true in terms of creating a majority inside this place but, in terms of representing a majority of votes in the population at large through the transmission belt of this representation, it works very differently indeed. The opposition with its 43 per cent of the vote nationally at the last election needs only to link up with these 160,000 votes or so&mdash;in effect, this scarcely more than one per cent&mdash;to determine the fate of governments, the fate of legislation and the effectiveness of public administration when, between them, they represent very much less than 50 per cent of the primary votes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is something a little unhealthy about that degree of power being concentrated in people with that little claim to represent any kind of democratic mandate in the sense of a majoritarian democratic mandate. It is all very well for minorities to have their voice. We appreciate their voice and it is all very nice having them chirp up from time to time, but it is not very nice having around 50,000 votes determining the ability of a government with five million votes to govern. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another point I want to make goes to the powers of the Senate. We are talking not about any old upper house but the most powerful upper house constitutionally in the Westminster world. There are no ifs, buts or maybes about that. The opposition does have the power to knock off budgets and money bills. It does have the power not just to delay legislation but to overturn legislation. It does have the power in this place to do more than any other upper house in the Westminster world&mdash;anywhere in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, the opposition has a demonstrated willingness to exercise that power. Not only in 1975 was the power to block supply exercised, but right now a majority of votes in this chamber is made up from people who have not denied themselves the capacity or the right to use the power to knock off governments. I do not think I am doing either the Greens or Senator Harradine an injustice when I say that I am not aware of them having committed themselves to never voting against blocking supply. I know the Democrats have, and I applaud them for that. But that is certainly not a position that has been adopted by the coalition or, to my knowledge, by the Greens or Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So at any time at any budget we could confront the situation once again that we confronted in 1975&mdash;that power not of review but of destruction. What is involved when we are talking about the operation of this particular chamber at the moment is the capacity to destroy; the demonstrated willingness to do that in the historical past, in 1975; and a demonstrated willingness to do it again at any time the mood so strikes those opposite. That is a pretty unhealthy state of affairs, I believe, and one that does not fit any rational conception of the way the Westminster system should work&mdash;which is that the government should be allowed to get on with the business of governing and should be rewarded or punished at the end of its term of office, depending on how well it has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a matter of saying that the upper house should not have a role at all. I strongly believe that the upper house has a legitimate role. I am on record in innumerable places as talking about the proper exercise of the right to review. I have talked in many places about the legitimate role of the committee system when it does work: to scrutinise legitimately governments; to operate to keep them accountable in terms of finance and administration; and, when it operates, to generate policy ideas, particularly in new areas of application. There are all sorts of useful things a properly constructed, thoughtful and democratically minded upper house can do and that the Senate has done, with varying degrees of success, now over quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us have a look at the way in which these powers are being exercised and these numbers are being exercised at the moment. We have, I think, all the elements of a deteriorating situation so far as the quality of democracy in this country is concerned. Look at it first from the point of view of the budget. Okay, we got through one way or another the budgetary process last year, but what a nerve-racking process that was. Of course, all of the things I am talking about are a product of the opposition acting in a thoroughly negative, obstructive, bloody-minded and unprincipled way as a result of its deep, very considerable distress&mdash;perfectly understandable distress, might I say&mdash;at losing the last election and a determination to destroy the capacity of the government to govern in every conceivable way it can at every step along the way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the operation of the budget last year, we managed, as I said, to stagger through the process and we may have put in processes now which will avoid a repetition of some of the worst excesses of that exercise last year. We can only sit and keep our fingers crossed and hope and pray that that will occur. But we have a situation emerging where, unless people do take a cold shower and a deep breath and think about the way in which Westminster systems work and operate, our budgetary process could very rapidly disintegrate, descend down that spiral staircase and get us into the budgetary process that is all too unhappily familiar in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United States, every annual budget is the product of an extended negotiation, a mercilessly protracted negotiation, between the executive arm of government and the Congress, with results that are all too readily apparent in terms of total fiscal irresponsibility as the executive, year after year, has to do deals left, right and centre in order to attract the necessary congressional majority. It has produced a desperately irresponsible budgetary process in the United States, which has worked to the economic disadvantage of not only the United States but indeed the whole world economy as a result of the blow-outs that have occurred and the inability to exercise any kind of discipline. That is the problem we face and there are all sorts of signs of that happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we have the problem that every time there is some grumble or whinge from a Green, as happened a few days ago when one of the Greens did not think the fiscal framework document was really going to be good enough, tremors are sent quivering through the financial market. It has a direct and immediate impact on the bond market and a direct and immediate impact on the exchange rate, for God's sake, just because, with the utmost respect to Senator Margetts&mdash;I am not wanting to get personal about this&mdash;someone whose latest date with the last electorate produced precisely 53,000 votes for her party, for her in particular, is able, by uttering a little bit of a whinge or a grumble of a fairly innocuous kind, to send tremors and shivers through the financial market because of the potential impact this was seen as having on the budgetary process and a responsible set of outcomes. It is, frankly, just loopy to be caught up in this state of affairs and it is food for thought, I would suggest, for those opposite as to how we are going to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, there is a place, of course, for a properly developed and constructed committee system. I have written lots about committee systems in the past. In fact, I once called them, I think, the Portnoys of the parliamentary system doing work that was all too often unproductive, not very satisfying but extremely tiring. Be that as it may&mdash;I will not pursue that particular metaphor any further on this occasion&mdash;I do acknowledge that the work in review and policy development that committees do can sometimes be very useful indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the way in which we have seen the committee system operating in recent times: the proliferation of select committees; the number crunching that has gone on to compose those committees, completely ignoring the principle of legitimate government chairmanship and majorities on them; and the attempt that was taken to extreme limits with the proposal for the sports program committee on which the government would have had just two out of seven members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we had the situation even with the pecuniary interests register committee, essentially a housekeeping committee, where the numbers had to be crunched in such a way that the government was thrown out of its legitimate role, and the procedure on other committees, of having the majority and having the chairmanship. But those opposite want to do it differently. If they proceed down this particular path, they are going to turn into crude partisan vehicles, institutional entities, committees which are capable of playing a much more constructive role in the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen the way in which the numbers in this place have been used and misused so far as legislation and the parliamentary timetable are concerned. I do not mind a substantial and a substantive debate on key legislation such as the IR bill or the Mabo bill last year. But did we need 29 hours of debate on the IR bill? Did we need 52 hours of debate, for God's sake, on Mabo?  Of course we did not. The substantive issues that were involved in that legislation could have been dealt with in a fraction of the percentage of the time. But the filibusters continue and the numbers are used in such a way that it is legislation by exhaustion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again we have problems with the actual effective administration of the country by the government: the escalating demands for the production of documents and the demands that are being made upon public servants to engage in massive tasks of bureaucratic file searching and data preparation, all to satisfy passing whims and fancies which, very often, are not followed up with any kind of thoughtful use of the material thus obtained at vast cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had the exercise with the vote on the Kelly disallowance regulation the other day where, for the first time in living memory, a legitimate government financial arrangement was made in order to move sideways someone who had not been a success in one job but clearly had a massive contribution to make to the public life of this country in a continuing position.

He is like a spoilt, petulant child who, if he does not get his own way, kicks his heels up in the air and throws his bat on the ground and jumps on it. The Prime Minister forgets the service this house performs for him every time he tries to ram his half-baked bills into the law books. If these bills failed to be subjected to the essential scrutiny of this place&mdash;that is, to be debated and amended by the house of review&mdash;it would not be long before legal weaknesses and deficiencies were found, which would quickly result in a rush on our already-congested judicial system.

In 1993, of the 432 amendments moved in the Senate, 182&mdash;nearly half&mdash;of those amendments were moved by the government itself. For God's sake, the government had to amend its own bills! Of the 432 amendments that were moved in the Senate, 182 were moved by the government and 178 of those were agreed to. The fact that the government has to make such wide ranging amendments to its bills makes one wonder about the quality of those bills in the first place. </PARA>

Why is the Prime Minister trying to undermine the power of the Senate, reducing it to no more than a rubber stamp? Does the Prime Minister want to be free to become the president of Australia, unfettered, without a Senate to keep him honest?

By and large, with the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine, I think there is a degree of cooperation, and people understand that.

The coalition will not exercise governmental power in the foreseeable future, so it is easy to fall back on being negative, on being obstructive. We saw that at the end of last year with Mabo. The performance opposite really was a sad chapter in this place. I acknowledge that three National Party of Australia senators, including from memory Senator McGauran, crossed the floor on one or two occasions endeavouring to represent part of their constituency. It is a great shame there was not more of that. It is a great shame that more people were not prepared to negotiate and to discuss the issues instead of simply exercise the block 36 negative votes.

The 1993 budget process ought never to be repeated. The budget is now becoming an accounting function. Proposals are going in other directions and, in that respect, we will see what happens with the statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on employment, industry and the regions at the end of April and the proposals that emerge from that. We will see whether the same agonising process of trading has to be gone through again in the Senate. It would be a great shame were that process to characterise what happens with serious policy issues. It ought not to occur.

However, I disagree with him about the Liberal Party in the Senate. Unfortunately, all too often the response of the Senate to political change has been as a house of reaction, as we saw with the time wasting, the filibustering, the frustration and the negativity on Mabo last year.

No lesser person than Winston Churchill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . this idea that a group of super-planners making the masses of the people do what they think is good for them, without any check or correction is a violation of democracy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Australian upper house, the Senate, has the power to  review, amend and ultimately reject any legislation presented to it from the House of Representatives, making it one of the most powerful upper houses in the world. This power to review and amend legislation is shared by many upper houses around the world and, although constitutional powers differ in each, the review process is a dominant function in nearly every one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this power is seen as very important, particularly given the increasing influence of the executive over the lower house. I refer Senator Loosley to the recent proposals brought in by procedural changes in the House of Representatives whereby the Prime Minister absents himself whenever he wishes. That is a clear demonstration of the power of the executive over the lower house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive in many cases has a monopoly on drafting legislation and policies, and has almost a guaranteed passage in the lower house. The second chamber is not only a safeguard against the hasty actions of the lower house; its accessibility to minority party and independent or non-aligned members allows for dissenting voices in the assembly. This capacity for dissent encourages genuine debate on legislation and, through committee review, permits time for the legislation to be digested by the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The composition of members in the upper houses, by virtue of the electoral process in place, means that it is possible for the ruling government of the day to have a minority in the upper house as we have at present.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revisory power of the upper house is a prime argument supporting bicameralism. With the political executive becoming increasingly dominant in legislative decision making, judicial appointments and vice-regal selections, as it is in the case of many Commonwealth nations, the upper house is perhaps the only forum for true debate and scrutiny over legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some argue that the Australian Senate, the states house, was established as the price of federation. However, in an era of new federalism, where the states are gaining greater autonomy, the need for a forum for state issues may be seen as even more important, particularly in light of the declining control individual states have in premiers conferences and the Loan Council. Thus, in a federal system, the upper house's role may be seen as far more effective than in unitary systems. Under conditions where members of the upper house are democratically elected, the presence of such a chamber is just as important to the democratic process of government as the lower house. In the extreme, one commentator even suggests that, if unicameralism is to be considered in Australia, the lower house should be the one abolished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proponents of unicameralism point to Scandinavia and Pacific nations as models of cameral reform. Unicameral legislatures are operating in Denmark, Sweden, Papua New Guinea and New Zealand. In the Scandinavian case, both countries embraced constitutional reforms in order to remove control from the monarchy and place it with the democratically elected legislature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inherently conservative and unrepresentative upper houses were abolished by drafting new constitutions. In the New Zealand example, the Legislative Council&mdash;that is, the upper house&mdash;was abolished in 1950 not out of contempt for the house but because of its failure as a revisory chamber. It was abolished in order to establish a more functional second chamber. These examples of functioning unicameral legislatures do not justify adopting unicameralism in federal systems as their relatively small size does not require strong regionally representative houses such as the Australian and American senates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A review of the bicameral process is far more desirable than a rejection of the upper house. Reform and review can establish controls on both houses and still allow them to maintain their independence. The upper house is not just a relic of Westminster but an honourable institution.

They are deliberate and calculated measures to ensure that the legislative process has checks and balances on the often dangerous and easily exploited system that is democracy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is classic Ted Mack; and it is quite an important observation. My response to Senator Evans's comments was in a letter to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> in which I said I regarded the threat by the government to change the Senate voting method as a compliment. It means the Senate is doing its job. For the first time since Federation the Senate is properly scrutinising legislation and overseeing the operations of the executive. As a result, the government wants to change the rules and make the Senate less representative. The Prime Minister called members of the Senate `unrepresentative swill'. However, the membership of the Senate is determined by the votes of over 85 per cent of the electorate. Control of the House of Representatives can be obtained, as at the last election, by a vote of 40 per cent of the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposals of Senator Evans and the Prime Minister would result in the Senate becoming as unrepresentative as the House of Representatives. Any change in the manner proposed by them would also give rise to either a tame Senate or a rubber stamp, as people have mentioned earlier, or a perpetually hung parliament because of different parties controlling the two Houses. Only retention of the current system or an improvement for even greater representation can ensure that the people of Australia receive the representation they need and deserve. Perhaps we ought to, as I believe one of my colleagues said earlier, be recommending the proportional representation system to the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to Senator Kemp's amendment. Senator Kemp suggested that there should be an additional statement based on equal representation for each state within the federation. The Greens do not support that amendment because we believe that it is already in the constitution and it does not require change. However, we feel it is contradictory to the motion as presented. We do not feel that it actually aids the argument to insist that the Senate is a states house or that that is its primary raison d'etre. It is actually the Senate as a house of review and consideration that is important. If it were a states house alone&mdash;and I think that would serve the Prime Minister's arguments very well&mdash;it would have been initially called a states assembly and not a Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I have considerable sympathy with those wanting to refrain from moving over to the Prime Minister's rather radical proposal. He thinks it is unfair that the states have equal representation in spite of unequal populations. What would he want, I wonder? That we have 12 times the number of senators from New South Wales than we have from Tasmania? I am sure he might like that, but I am sure we would not. No, thank you; we have quite enough representation from the New South Wales Right&mdash;and perhaps that does not mean that we should be encouraging this kind of thinking by the Prime Minister. I will not talk about the quantity of votes because I actually think this is more than a numbers game; it is an opportunity to reflect community views in our country and do justice to the issues that are raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is more representative, as I said before, than the House of Representatives. It reflects community views, and those who support the Greens, the Democrats and currently minority views are very grateful for that. The Senate is valuable to the major parties also because it is a way of signalling the way in which the community is thinking about the important issues like the environment, social justice, peace and disarmament, and participatory democracy. It is ignored by the major parties at their peril. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is extremely valuable to the House of Representatives and to the government as a mechanism for addressing its accountability to the people of Australia, not to the parliament. That is our role as a Senate: to keep the government and the executive from becoming arrogant or refraining from respecting the views of the people, and to keep them accountable within the three-year electoral periods that they submit themselves to. The Senate is important in that respect. It is also important for us to reflect on the fact that we have quite a long way to go in respecting the views of the Australian people. Any mechanism that diminishes our accountability and our representation of the views in the community is a very damaging one and we should actually be going in the opposite direction.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to speak in this debate because it is a very different sort of debate from those we normally have in this place. We are often so concerned with the nitty-gritty of legislation that we rarely have an opportunity to stand back and look at the whole system of government that we have in this country. Preparing for this debate, and standing back and looking at the whole system, really made me appreciate what we have in terms of parliamentary democracy, why what we have created is so precious, and why we should not let the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who has ulterior motives on this matter, to tinker with what is probably the best system of government in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look back in history, we can really appreciate how new the system of government we have is. With that, we can really appreciate how fragile this system of government is. Australia, which was settled by Europeans 200 years ago and which has had a federal system for only 93 years, is the sixth oldest democracy in the world. That shows us how fragile the system is. We created, I believe, a unique amalgam of the civilisation from which we had sprung in terms of the American and the British systems of government. I believe we have a superior system to the British and American systems because we took the best of both worlds. This is best exemplified, I believe, in the creation of the Senate. We created one of the most powerful upper houses, if not the most powerful upper house, in the world. When creating that upper house we gave it the opportunity not only to review the legislation of the government but also to represent the very diverse and vast regions of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I came into this place I really came to appreciate the role, power and responsibility that the Senate had in keeping government in this country on track. The fact that there was a check on government was probably one of the Senate's strongest features. I was absolutely amazed not only at the amount of legislation that went through the parliament but also at how often the government got it wrong. I was also amazed at the number of amendments introduced. Senator Loosley talked about the Mabo debate. How many amendments were there to the Mabo bill? I think there were about 270 in the end. If we had a unicameral system, how many amendments would there have been to that bill? I suspect none. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was brought home very strongly to me when I first got here with the Education Export Bill. It was the first bill I worked on in committee. The government brought in a piece of legislation hastily prepared and poorly drafted and, by the end of the process, we had successfully introduced 32 amendments to this bill and totally reversed its direction from overregulation to deregulation. Since that bill came in, the educational export sector has grown from $800 million to $1,200 million. This sort of framework we set up allowed our education and our exports to expand. It was because of the role of this house of review and the creation of more sensible legislation that this took place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the Prime Minister wants to tinker with this. He wants to tinker with a lot of things: the flag, the constitution and constitutional democracy, and now he wants to tinker with the way in which the Senate is elected. We have to ask why. The basic answer is that this Senate stands, like those other things stand, as a bulwark against the untrammelled power of an elected lower house. That is our unique position in keeping that under control. The Prime Minister is not saying that he is going to abolish the Senate&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps in a fit of pique at one stage he might have said that. I am sure he did not mean it. I think he meant that he wanted to reform the Senate so that he could control it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One interesting reform he is suggesting is to change the system of election of the Senate, from the excellent system set up by a Labor leader, Dr Herbert Vere Evatt, who, on introducing and putting forward the ALP arguments for the current system of proportional representation, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many years there has been a demand that the Parliament should provide a system of electing senators which would give more equitable results and enable the electorate to be more truly represented in the Senate. The Government has given careful consideration to the matter and had closely examined alternative methods. It has decided that, in relation to the election of Senators, where each State votes as one electorate, the fairest system and the one most likely to enhance the status of the Senate is that of proportional representation.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Evatt did not get much right in his life but he certainly got that right. He created an excellent system. Why does Mr Keating want to change it? We can see the reason when we look at my state's results in the lower house and the upper house. In the lower house, the government controls 34 of the 50 seats&mdash;68 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens in the Senate? In the last election we on this side won three out of six seats&mdash;50 per cent. That represents the true feeling of the people of the country. The state boundaries of this country cannot be rorted and the Senate is elected on state boundaries. The Prime Minister cannot change that. The government can fiddle around with the lower house boundaries and produce distorted results, in some cases ones that Governor Gerry of Massachusetts&mdash;who invented the original gerrymander&mdash;would have been proud of, but the Prime Minister cannot change the Senate boundaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this country, Labor has won the last five elections, having only 30 seats to the coalition's 36. This, accumulated over the last two elections, shows the real balance of power, the real reflection of the people's will in this country. That is why it is absolutely vital that this system stay as a bulwark against this government. We have created a unique system of checks and balances in this country. The Senate is one of the most important of these checks against the unbridled power of government and we tamper with it at our peril. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate has been conducted on the basis of the Senate being in the same form now as it was when the rules were developed in the 1890s, in a situation where separate colonies had their own customs systems and their own defence responsibilities and were connected directly to the United Kingdom&mdash;or Britain as it was then called. The only way those colonies were prepared to come together, obviously, was by some representation which safeguarded, as they saw it, their own particular interests. For that reason, the first constitution contained the right for the states to have equal representation in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first constitution also contained a provision, which is still there, for the Senate to contain about half the number of people in the House of Representatives. There was a suggestion that, regardless of the need for any particular number of senators, if the number of members in the House of Representatives were increased to look after the interests of their constituents, which is a very real task for them, then the number in this house would have to be increased.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly not like Senator Abetz&mdash;that the argument for equal representation is still valid just because at one time, in 1890, the states in this country had to be given equal representation to encourage them to join a federation. I do not believe anyone could be convinced on that argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate was clearly introduced as a states house, which it has never been. I will not suggest that the Senate has never acted as a house of review. It has on occasions, and in the process of its operation it has overseen changes in suggested legislation. As has already been agreed here today and on other occasions by people on this side of the house, suggestions by people on the other side to improve legislation have often been picked up. Of course, our drafters and the people who are in charge of legislation are not perfect and we do make some errors in that regard&mdash;and we appreciate any assistance on the matter&mdash;but there are also issues upon which we will not move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country is unarguably over-governed. I believe the number of politicians we have in this country to govern such a small population and the amount of duplication in services to the community are shocking. It is time we looked to some changes. It has been very difficult to change the constitution over many years unless both parties have been in agreement. I believe that is certainly no reason to suggest that we should not look at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People are saying that proportional representation is the be all and end all, that it is a great way in which to elect people and that it gives true representation. If that is the case, it follows that the method of election in the House of Representatives should be changed&mdash;which I do not agree should occur. I believe the House of Representatives is the way to go. Even if one were to accept proportional representation as the way to elect people to this chamber, it does not necessarily mean that we need 12 senators to represent each state to have a proper review process operate and to get quality legislation. The single chamber process has operated quite successfully in certain areas. In Queensland it has operated for many years&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that many intelligent people say to themselves, `Here we are in the federal sphere where we spend quite a lot of money on elections to elect members of the House of Representatives; we pay them reasonably well; it costs us a lot of money to support them in terms of the work they do. But then we merrily go on and elect a group of other people who then reject the legislation of the House of Representatives'. That does not make a lot of sense, even though I agree with the question of review&mdash;and some people might say the total right of the single house process&mdash;but to me the constitution can contain those sorts of prohibitions, and also the High Court can prevent any excesses that might occur in a federal government which was a single house operation. </PARA>

It did not come from the House of Lords, it does not reflect the requirement to have a peerage or, as in other upper houses, some landed qualification. It is not purely a states' house as in Canada or Germany. The equality of state representation does not, of itself, make it unrepresentative.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand Senator Abetz walking out of here fearfully because if any state needs equal representation it is Tasmania and, to a lesser extent, Queensland, Western Australia and South Australia. All the representatives of those states are joining in this debate. The presence of 12 senators from Tasmania or Queensland in the caucus or the joint party rooms gives a balance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's proposal is that 12 large Senate electorates be created in each state and that senators would be elected from those electorates rather than from the entire state. On many occasions I have debated issues such as tobacco, sugar, small business, the Torres Strait Islands, and Aboriginal communities. If we were elected from one constituency, we would have the same narrow view of the constituencies that is reflected in the lower house. </PARA>

The Senate is part of that constitution. The states are part of that constitution. I do not see any need to alter our wonderful constitution because of the continual frustrations of the government. If the government wants to win the balance of power in the Senate I suggest to the government that it lifts its game and campaigns to increase its numbers in the Senate. Otherwise, do not touch something that is working, that is unbroken, that is effective and that has given Australia a great way of living. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to address the issue of the Senate as a states house. When I go round to schools in Victoria talking to students of politics about the role of the Senate, I ask them: `Can you tell me what you know about the role of Senate?'. They will say, `It is a house of review and it is a states house, but it is not a states house because you do not vote on state lines'. My answer to that is, `It is very sad that many of your textbooks are written by teachers who are not actually practitioners, who maybe have not spent time sitting in the galleries or who have not been members of parliament'. From the outside it would appear to many that the Senate is not a states house. Obviously, Senator Burns, who hardly every speaks in this chamber, does not think about the issue of the Senate as a states house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let me tell the Senate some of the things I say to the students. One of the major issues is that as a states house&mdash;and I do not know what goes on in the caucus room, but I know what goes on in our party room, although I will not disclose the things that go on&mdash;if an issue comes up about transport, I can bet my bottom dollar that the Tasmanians will be on their feet. If an issue comes up about gold tax, I know that the Western Australians and some of the Victorians will be on their feet. I know that if it is an issue about some other area that relates particularly to a state, those senators will support the House of Representatives members from those states and argue vehemently in the party room. I do not know what they do over there on that side of the chamber, but on this side I know that those senators represent their states in the party room. So in one of the major parties the states are represented in the party room. That is one of the benefits of the Senate; it gives the smaller states representation that they would not have in the major party rooms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also say to the students that one of the things that happens because we have a Senate is that the many thousands of people who vote in their electorates and who do not happen to win&mdash;Liberal supporters who vote and do not win or Labor supporters who vote and do not win&mdash;in their senators have direct representation in the federal parliament. If they are Liberal voters living in a Labor electorate they can go to a senator who they know shares similar views to theirs. If this were a single-house parliament they would not have that access. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other things that can happen is, for example, between 1990 and 1993 we had no Labor seats in rural Victoria, except if we took Burke, an electorate on the edge of the city which had some city-based towns and some rural area&mdash;not very much. This meant that between 1990 and 1993 there was not one member of parliament representing the views of rural Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell honourable senators what happened during that period. There was an issue. The then Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services, Mr Staples, in his wisdom decided that one of the ways the government could rationalise things was to merge all small rural nursing homes in Victoria that were less than 250 kilometres apart. That was the sensitive, caring thing the government was going to do. So, if a nursing home in a little town in Victoria had fewer than 20 beds, the government was going to merge it with a nursing home less than 250 kilometres away. So a person 85 years of age living in a nursing home in a rural town could be shifted to some other nursing home in Bullamakanka or wherever in Victoria. That person's spouse, who might be 83, would then have to travel all that distance to visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I heard about this decision I went into orbit. I could not believe it. I could not believe that this caring Labor government, as part of this wonderful economic rationalisation, was going to merge these small rural nursing homes. I talked to my colleagues from the other states about it. Guess what? They were not concerned. Why were they not concerned? The answer is that there are hardly any small rural nursing homes in the other states. In fact, almost none were going to be affected by this decision. It was going to affect Victoria in particular. I got that message from across the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When there is an issue, such as small rural nursing homes, people go to their representative in the House of Representatives. All they know is that it is an electorate issue. But, as senators, we get the overview of the whole state. We begin to see that it is not only happening in Bourke, Wannon or McEwen; it is happening in every electorate in the state. So, with that overview, we can raise the issues that affect our states in the party room. It is a nonsense to say that the Senate is not a states house. It may not be a states house in the traditional sense that our forefathers, who set down the constitution, believed it was going to be. We know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Burns may stand up and say, `Yes, we vote along party lines'. He has not learnt his history because he said the Senate&mdash;I do not want to misquote him but I think he implied this&mdash;had never voted along state lines. That is not correct; it has in the past. But, as I said before, in the party room the smaller states are heard very loudly and are supported because they have five or six senators in each of the major parties who can put their views. They are in addition to the very small number of members of the House of Representatives from states like Western Australia and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of a quirk of fate which lasted from 1990 to 1993, not one member of the House of Representatives came from rural Victoria. Rural Victoria was not represented in the government of the day. The only way it could be represented in the Labor caucus room was by Labor senators. I think that that speaks for itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other valuable roles that a senator can play is to look at issues on a state-wide basis. People can legitimately come to us. I can understand that a member of the House of Representatives may be very busy when somebody from an electorate far away rings them up and says, `I have a concern'. If small rural nursing homes are not their big beef, they will do what they can for the small rural nursing homes in their own electorates. But they are not going to be terribly concerned, because something that happens in another electorate is not going to win votes for them. If they are concerned about people, they might see them, but they will not have the same commitment that a senator has because these people are the senator's constituents. That is the issue. The major point that I want to make today is that it may appear from the outside that the Senate is not a states house but, when we look at its function, we find that it is in fact a states house. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Spindler's motion. We are debating the wider notion of Senate electoral reform. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others have attacked the Senate as unrepresentative because states of vastly different sizes have the same number of senators. We have heard a lot about that this evening. Perhaps one way to remedy that is to have equal numbers of senators from electorates of equal size. That is an option for discussion that I think we should talk about. That remedy would require a constitutional referendum&mdash;not a joint sitting and a vote of both houses. Most of us know that the history of constitutional referenda is that a referendum would probably fail, but there is no harm in discussing options.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple fact is that, despite the different sizes of the states, the composition of the Senate very closely follows the national vote for each party. That is because proportional representation does tend to compensate for electorates of different sizes. This means that the Senate is much more representative of voter intention than the House of Representatives. In 1990, Labor won control of the House of Representatives with 39.4 per cent of the primary vote. That could not happen in the Senate. Only a few per cent of Senate primary votes do not go to a winning candidate. This compares with more than 50 per cent of House of Representatives votes which go to losing candidates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any move to strip Australians of an effective vote will further alienate the voting public from the parliament which is supposed to represent them. It is ironic that, just at a time when New Zealand is introducing mixed member proportional representation to remedy precisely the problem we are talking about, this government is toying with the idea of sending our electoral system back to the 19th century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of propaganda about the way in which the Senate was only ever supposed to be a states house, yet it has failed to play that role. The Senate was established with two roles in mind: one was as a states house and the other as a house of review. That is why many of our constitution framers, including some of its most distinguished, favoured electing the Senate by proportional representation. That is also why the first ever Commonwealth electoral bill, tabled in 1902, provided for the Senate to be elected by proportional representation. The bill was defeated, but it showed beyond doubt that the Senate was widely seen from the outset as a house of review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister believes that this Senate has failed to act as a house of review and that it has tried to usurp the role of executive government. The Democrats agree that the machinations of this chamber have been pretty hair-raising at times and occasionally we have put a toe over the line. For example, we disagreed with the double deadline motion and the way in which debates over the budget and native title were unnecessarily drawn out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, looking beyond the theatre and at the actual outcomes, what has the Senate done to upset the government so much? We made the budget fairer, with the overwhelming support of the Australian public, while leaving the government's deficit targets intact. We passed native title and industrial relations reforms with significant improvements. We have insisted on uncovering the circumstances surrounding the sale of large slabs of the Fairfax press to Conrad Black. We pressured the House of Representatives to take a proper look at Mrs Kelly's ministerial performance and we won agreement for a range of accountability reforms. It is the outcomes which ultimately matter. These outcomes have been responsible, constructive and democratic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Have we obstructed the government's legislative program? Hardly. The government has often struggled to provide us with enough legislation to keep the chamber working. Have we set ourselves up as an alternative government? Hardly. We have acted within the constitution and, for the most part, within the bounds of convention. It is the government which has tried to usurp the role of the Senate&mdash;not the other way round. Remember the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill? It was a blatant and unconstitutional attempt to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason the Senate is able to function as a house of review is that we are elected by proportional representation. The Australian people have used proportional representation strategically. They have ensured that no single major party controls this chamber and that a more diverse range of views is heard than in the House of Representatives. The result is that legislation cannot be rammed through and, equally, oppositions cannot easily obstruct. That means that negotiation is required and negotiation is often a good thing because it forces us to focus on the merits of the issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our decision making processes are more open and more accessible than those in the House of Representatives, and this imposes a greater discipline on us to act in the public interest. The result, I would argue, is decisions which are more creative, more independent and, in general, more rational. They are not all good, but they are light years ahead of those made in the other place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who would gain from the sorts of changes Mr Keating has threatened? It is hard to judge that, because we would have a Senate dominated by either government or opposition. The result could well be either meek obedience or total obstruction, but the biggest blow would be to democracy, which would lose the most. Australia would lose its most powerful check on executive government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that any electoral change is motivated in part by self-interest. Labor's introduction of proportional representation for the Senate in 1948 was no exception. Labor calculated that it would give it control of the Senate if it lost government in 1949, and it was right, if only for two years. But the bill passed with bipartisan support because there was also a higher principle at stake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preferential bloc voting system was a joke. It had been recognised since before Federation that proportional representation would strengthen the Senate's house of review function. This Prime Minister's threat to change the Senate voting system has no such redeeming features. It is motivated by nothing more than a contempt for the important role the Senate plays and for the views of the Australian public. The government cannot avoid facing voters at election time, but it would dearly love to avoid accounting to them between elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the difference between the view of the Democrats on the role of the Senate and the need for change and the view of the government is the weight of historical and contemporary argument in favour of our view. We can point all the way back to the constitution's framers. We can point to John Stuart Mill's argument that second houses of parliament should be elected by a system which allows minority views to be represented and allows the chamber to act as a check on executive government. We can point to the WA Inc. royal commission, which argued for a house of review elected by proportional representation, and we can point to the worldwide trend&mdash;including just across the Tasman&mdash;to more representative electoral systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have yet to see one considered opinion in favour of single member electorates for the Senate, but I have seen numerous editorials and opinion pieces which range from the sceptical to the hostile. The most interesting comment was by Crispin Hull in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 7 March. Mr Hull points out in his article that if the government legislated to establish 12 single-member electorates in each state then it could be argued that half of the voters of each state would be deprived of a vote at each half-Senate election. This may be constitutionally unsound. It certainly would be very unpopular as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An alternative would be to divide the state into six electorates. There would be two senators per electorate, one of whom would go to the polls at each half-Senate election. But a problem arises in the event of a double dissolution, where two senators would have to be chosen per electorate. This is what happens now in the ACT and the Northern Territory, and the result would probably be the same&mdash;a hung Senate with 38 senators on each side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think our focusing on this motion is timely, because maybe the government needs to be reminded that this Senate is not a factional brawl and that this parliament is not the sole possession of the Labor tribe; it is the property of the Australian people, and it deserves a lot more respect than it has been shown of late. The Senate's present system of proportional representation is a pillar of our democracy. It is what makes this chamber a house of review. It gives almost all Australians a primary vote which counts, and that is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate is the only house which is prepared to stand up to an arrogant government and hold it to account. In discussing this motion, I guess what we are saying is if we undermine proportional representation, we undermine democracy. If that does not worry the government, then maybe the fact that it would almost certainly lose control of both houses just might. Perhaps the thought of a double dissolution focusing on the role of the Senate and the constructive role of minority parties within that Senate would be the ideal issue on which to go to an election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Asylum, border control and detention </EMPHASIS>is a mixed bag of goods. The report does not recommend, as it should have, a scrapping of the detention system in favour of releasing asylum seekers into community care while their cases are being decided. There are, however, a number of other recommendations which are an advance. The committee's main recommendation was that unauthorised border arrivals who claim refugee status be held in detention while their cases are assessed but that, if they are held for more than six months as a result of lack of action or error by the department, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs should consider releasing them with a bridging visa. The introduction of the bridging visa is an advance on the previous system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also recommends that the minister have regard to any special needs based on age, health or previous experience of torture or trauma, whether applicants are likely to abscond and whether there are adequate community support arrangements. Other positive recommendations are that priority should be given to the processing of claims by refugees, that an advisory committee should be established on the conditions and services in detention centres, that children in detention centres should be allowed to attend local schools and that medical personnel should be provided to detainees who can speak the language of the detainees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, perhaps the most negative and most deplorable aspect of the report is that it also recommends that moves be made to curtail legal challenges to decisions on refugee claims by amending legislation to limit the opportunity for making such challenges in the Federal Court. This would move us further in the totally unacceptable direction of creating a class of people who appear before Australian courts but who do not have equal rights with other people in Australia. This principle of equal rights is one we should not relinquish. It is a principle to which every civilised society should subscribe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats did make a submission to the inquiry. We said in that submission that the system as it stands contravenes our obligations under international human rights law. It is economically inequitable, causes undue hardship on detainees and compounds their emotional, psychological and physical ill health. As I have indicated, the recommendations in this report do not adequately address these particular shortcomings. The preamble to the universal declaration on human rights declares:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"no one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest, detention or exile."</PARA>
<PARA>Yet, as I said, the recommendations in that report do not go as far as to put an end to the shameful provisions of detention that we have practised for quite a number of years. While there are some improvements, they certainly do not go far enough. Article 22 of the international convention on the rights of the child says that children are entitled to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . receive appropriate protection and humanitarian assistance in the enjoyment of . . . rights set forth in the Convention and in other international human rights or humanitarian instruments to which the state is a party.</PARA>
<PARA>Very clearly, what we are continuing to do does not meet the standards set in that convention which Australia has both signed and ratified. I turn to the international convention relating to the status of refugees which provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States shall not impose penalties, on account of the illegal entry or presence, on refugees who, coming directly from a territory. . . where their life or freedom was threatened . . . are present in their territory without authorisation, provided they present themselves without delay to the authorities and show good cause for their illegal entry or presence. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States shall not apply to the movements of such refugees restrictions other than those which are necessary and such restrictions shall only be applied until their status is regularised or until they obtain admission to another country. The contracting states shall allow such refugees a reasonable period and all the necessary facilities to obtain admission to another country.</PARA>
<PARA>I express regret that the committee has not seen fit to address these standards to which we as a nation should aspire. I return to what I consider to be the most deplorable situation. Twice now we have passed legislation in this parliament which denies a particular class of people equal rights before Australian courts. We have passed legislation which limits grounds for appeal. It is difficult to believe but we in this parliament have excluded, as a ground for appeal, bias by the tribunal in the decision on refugee status. Despite the strenuous opposition of the Australian Democrats, this parliament does not think that if somebody shows bias that should be sufficient grounds for appeal. This chamber has also excluded natural justice as a ground for appeal, over the strenuous opposition of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is deplorable that the committee has not seen fit to be critical of those decisions and to recommend that they be reversed. On the contrary, the committee has suggested that further restrictions be imposed on the legal rights of asylum seekers. I think it is worth remembering that these things are contrary to the basic legal rights that every citizen should have. We are saying, `We are entitled to guard our borders. We are entitled to ensure that some 500 people who come here by boat do not enter and do not jeopardise our security and our immigration policy, which admits migrants, immigrants and refugees of the order of 80,000 or 90,000'. For the sake of imposing restrictions and guarding our borders against several hundred people, we are prepared to jettison a basic principle of human rights and legal safeguards. I think that is a great matter of regret and continues to be a blot on the record of this parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am conscious of the time, so I will try to keep my remarks within the time limit. I rise to speak to the 46th report of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. As honourable senators would be aware, I wrote to the then President of the Senate, Senator Sibraa, on 27 September last year asking the Senate to consider whether false or misleading information had been supplied to Estimates Committee E or to the Senate regarding the proposed tax on the diesel fuel rebate scheme and whether the matter should be referred to the Standing Committee of Privileges. The then President, having considered the matter, referred it to the privileges committee and its report has been tabled in the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister responsible for the Australian Customs Service, Senator Schacht, wrote a letter to the privileges committee outlining why he felt that false or misleading information had not been provided to the committee. In this letter he concluded by asking:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What possible benefit or motive could there have been for providing false or misleading information?</PARA>
<PARA>I agree that in the minister's case there was no possible benefit or motive. In fact, it would have been positively stupid for the minister to knowingly mislead an estimates committee, but there were also senior customs officers involved in this incident, and I suggest that in their case the question the minister asked was the wrong question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that should have been asked is: when faced with two separate opportunities on the evening of 26 August to provide the correct information to Estimates Committee E about the legislation required to implement the tax, why would senior customs officers, including Mr Frank Kelly, the then comptroller-general, and Ms Virginia Stretton, the national manager of inland revenue, fail to provide that information? What logical explanation can there be for this failure?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To my mind, there can be only two explanations. First, these senior officers&mdash;despite their seniority and expertise, despite their attendance at briefings on budget related matters, despite discussions that must have taken place within Customs about the need for legislation, despite drafting instructions having been issued by Mr Stephen Holloway of Customs on 17 August, a full week before the hearing on 26 August, and despite a draft bill being in existence and present in Customs on 24 August, two days before the hearing&mdash;were so vague, so unsure and so unprofessional that they simply could not recall any details whatsoever that might have led them to have suggested to the minister at the very least that legislation might be required, let alone the fact that it was required and a draft bill was already in existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply cannot accept this explanation. It defies all logical explanation, and I reject it completely. The privileges committee also had great difficulty with this concept. The committee stated, quite generously, that it `had difficulty understanding the collective lapse in memory amongst a number of officers'. The committee also stated that it was sceptical of the reason given by Mr Kelly as to why other officers did not even bring the possibility of legislation to the minister's attention. The reason given was that these officers thought the minister knew something that they did not. This would have to be some sort of record. It would be one of the few times that public servants thought their minister knew something that they did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the collective lapse in memory, as I have already stated, it is simply not believable that this took place. I do not accept that not one of the senior officers, including Ms Stretton, who is the manager of the branch that would be responsible for collecting the tax, could recall any details that could be passed on to the minister. It leaves only this alternative explanation: the officers did not tell the minister all the information within their knowledge. The question I ask is: why?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that on 26 August, when I first asked questions about the possibility of legislation, the officers concerned were perhaps a little uncertain. After all, Mr Stephen Holloway, the legal officer who issued the drafting instructions for the legislation, was not there. But what I cannot accept is that, during the 1 1/2-hour interval when customs officers left the hearing room to seek more information about the tax, it did not occur to them&mdash;any one of them&mdash;either that they knew drafting instructions had been issued and a draft bill was in existence or, at the very least, that there had been discussions about the new tax which the inland revenue branch would have to administer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kelly has suggested that his officers either did not recall or were so unsure that they decided not to mention to the minister even the possibility of this new legislation. Apart from this explanation not being believable, it simply does not tie in with what the minister advised me after the 1 1/2-hour interval. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I understand it, it has been determined that it is not necessary for legislation to have an administrative fee . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The minister did not say, `My officers aren't certain', or `They can't recall the details', or `My officers don't know but will check for you', or anything like that. Instead, the minister made the positive statement, `It has been determined that legislation is not required'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me&mdash;maybe I am wrong&mdash;that the officer or officers who gave the advice to the minister gave him something in writing or told him verbally that it had been determined or decided, or words to that effect, that legislation was not necessary. I cannot imagine that the minister, having been advised by customs officers that they really were not sure of the situation, would of his own volition have stated quite clearly, `It has been determined'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the impression was given to the minister on 26 August that these officers had gone away and found the answers to the questions I had raised. That would explain the answer given when Senator Hill asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you have satisfied yourselves that it is simply a matter of your announcing that you are going to deduct what you deem to be an administrative fee which you define as one per cent and that there is no further regulatory or legislative process necessary to implement that.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister responded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I understand it, yes.</PARA>
<PARA>Only the officers concerned know why they would have implied to the minister that they had gone away and confirmed that legislation was not necessary. As I have said before in this chamber, it has been suggested to me that Customs saw an ideal opportunity to mushroom the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given all the circumstances of this case, I believe the privileges committee has arrived at the correct and proper verdict and has made appropriately strong comments about the actions of the customs officers involved. It is obvious that the committee has strong reservations about the reasons given as to why the officers involved did not provide the minister with correct information. I concur with those reservations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank the members of the committee and its staff for the time and effort they put into investigating this matter and preparing the report. Nevertheless, it is still my opinion that the full story has not come out. I can only repeat that I simply do not believe that, of all the customs officers present on 26 August, not one of them could recall any detail of the proposed legislation. I also do not accept that these senior officers were so unsure that they decided to keep the doubt to themselves and not inform the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if these officers honestly did not recall or had doubts, they had over an hour to verify the situation. There was absolutely no excuse for that not to have happened and for them to give misleading information to the minister, who then told the estimates committee that it had been determined that legislation was not required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, as it would appear that many of the statements that I have made about customs have been circulated far and wide, I take this opportunity to reassure customs officers that I fully support their role in enforcing the law as it relates to customs. But I do not support customs officers taking the law into their hands, as happened in the Midford Paramount case, and ruining people's lives and businesses. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> I also do not support such actions being covered up by the customs service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments I have made in this chamber over the last seven months about Customs have been directed only at those officers who were involved in Midford Paramount either directly or in the cover-up, those who seek to perpetuate the myth that Customs did nothing wrong in the Midford Paramount case, those who seek to avoid proper parliamentary scrutiny, those who do not take the estimates process seriously and those who believe that Customs can operate outside the law. I am very aware that this relates to only a minority of officers. I am concerned that if voluntary redundancies are called for in the future it will be the good customs officers who leave and the bad apples who remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is on the record. I asked the minister about these issues at the last estimates hearings and I am encouraged that the minister also shares this concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 14 March I asked Senator Cook, the Minister representing the Treasurer, whether he acknowledged that the Australian Taxation Office's pre-consultative document on taxation of financial arrangements would add substantially to compliance costs and run counter to tax simplification. I referred to the government's commitment to tax simplification and contrasted that goal with the document whose effect is that, on a five-year debenture involving a partnership or a company, 1,826 separate calculations may be required in computing the daily internal rate of return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I thank the Treasury officers for their very generous offer of a briefing on the paper. This may be necessary, given that Senator Cook's answer clearly avoided the central issues to which my question was directed&mdash;the increased compliance costs to corporations and the stark contrast of this document in the face of the promises of simplification of taxation laws. To bring in during question time a calculator with an internal rate of return button and wave it around as the simple answer to my question is to trivialise and attempt to simplify a matter of concern to many corporate taxpayers, particularly those who have thousands of transactions a month and have hundreds of investment products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press of a button will not, I am sure, be sufficient documentation for the tax office in a tax return. It will require a spreadsheet, for example, to justify Senator Cook's calculation. Under the circumstances, particularly on a discounted security on maturity, it may well run to 14 or 15 pages of spreadsheet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook's gesture also showed that he was unwilling to do the calculations involved in answering my question. This makes his trivialisation a major concern. Clearly, this is a further demonstration that quite frequently the Australian Public Service is not aware of the consequences of so many of its proposals. This gap, unfortunately, is one that is manifested, I believe, in the taxation of financial arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook's answer unjustifiably downplayed the increased compliance costs using the compound accrual system. The daily compounding rate is not usually used by companies in calculating the spread of income or expenditure associated with financial transactions. To require companies to return their financial transactions using the daily compound accrual rate, therefore, will increase their compliance costs quite substantially. Naturally, compliance costs in the first year will be greater than those in latter years because the first year costs will include one-off items such as increased software, hardware upgrade and replacement and design costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his answer Senator Cook also said that a company or partnership having to calculate the daily internal rate of return could use a standard calculator but that some further adjustment to this figure may be necessary depending on such factors as irregular spacing of coupon payments and the degree of precision required. Has he consulted with the Taxation Office on the degree of precision required? Was his calculator waving exercise a government assurance that the Taxation Office would accept a calculation based on a simple financial calculator? Let me also point out to Senator Cook that the consultative document, unlike his answer, concedes frequently throughout the publication:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . reflecting the economic substance of complex arrangements is likely to mean that some complexity in the law will be unavoidable.</PARA>
<PARA>It is beyond my comprehension how time and time again this government can say that we are going to simplify the tax legislation and time and again seek to add more pages to an already complex tax system. The consultative document in itself is about 160 pages long, and I guess the legislation to implement the proposal would be at least as long as that, if not longer. The parliament has currently before it yet another example of the further complication of tax laws. The government added to its amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993 a number of other amendments, particularly in relation to superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook is right in saying that the straight-line method will involve one simple calculation. However, he misled us all by implying that many taxpayers could use the straight-line method. The document proposes that the accruals tax system will not cover financial transactions of natural persons except where there is an opportunity for significant tax referral. Even that exemption is qualified. The exemption will not apply if the taxpayer's holdings of financial arrangements exceed a specified minimum value threshold of $500,000. This will catch many small business transactions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede that the document does state that if the straight-line system basically produces the same result as the daily pending accruals system, that sum can be used. But I wish to point out that a calculation will still be required to determine if both systems produce approximately equal results. So either way both methods still have to be calculated, which is quite time consuming, and under taxation law there has to be documentary proof to show those calculations&mdash;it could be a simple calculation that runs to something like 14 to 15 pages on a computer spreadsheet. My question was specifically aimed at partnerships and corporations, and the document says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to reduce compliance difficulties in respect of relatively small and unsophisticated financial dealings, consideration will be given to the feasibility of extending to business the threshold that will apply to natural persons but subject to similar conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>I will now turn more generally to the taxation of financial arrangements. Does the government think that it has in fact made out a case for compound accrual accounting in any circumstances? I hope that Senator Sherry will be able to answer that. If he is unable to answer it, I believe that this matter should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration so we can get an answer. This is the matter that I put down for report earlier today. I do not believe that a case has been made out; in fact, there was no attempt to make out a case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Taxation Office's attitude appears to be that the implementation of this document is a foregone conclusion. But is this not a so-called pre-consultative document? Hence, there is all the more reason for Senate overview. I remind the Senate that the Coles Myer decision highlights the need to clarify the law in relation to this matter. The High Court in that case adopted a straight-line basis rather than a compound accrual basis. The problems that I have referred to here with respect to the application of the accrual system to debentures is equally applicable to foreign exchange gains and losses. This fact was highlighted by a letter written to the editor by Mr Robin Speed, which appeared in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, in which he states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If he purchases (equipment) under the proposed accruals tax system he will be taxed on any currency movement between the date of the order and year end, regardless of the fact that he has not received machinery let alone paid for it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the compound accrual system will adversely affect a company that goes into insolvency before the financial transaction is complete. In that circumstance the company will not be able to recover the tax paid on the transaction at all, because we do not have such a system of recovery. Senator Cook's answer should be viewed as something of an embarrassment to the Treasurer's office. It clearly sought to trivialise a matter which warrants much more thought than he obviously gave it. Therefore, I would like to see Senator Cook waving a calculator at the tax office and claiming that his calculator justifies a figure in a tax return. I believe it would not. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak also on quality assurance and some of its bad unintended effects, particularly on two institutions in this city: the Australian National University and the John Curtin School of Medical Research. I spoke on this matter the other night but I did not have time on that occasion to include comments on the way in which the John Curtin School of Medical Research and the Australian National University have been disadvantaged by quality assurance mechanisms. I will do that tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the other night I spoke about the nature of this mechanism. The government allocated $76 million&mdash;not of new money, but of money clawed back from universities&mdash;for redistribution in a most inequitable and unfair way. It has taken $76 million away from the 37 universities and given 65 per cent of it back to the top nine universities. The newer universities in particular, which need nurturing and encouragement, have actually been discriminated against, with the bias being towards the older, larger and&mdash;the most important point&mdash;better-endowed universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing that this Labor government that speaks about equity has set up a system in higher education where the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. Probably the greatest tragedy of this process is the way in which the government allocates the money. It uses a totally unfair system. Honourable senators should remember that this is supposed to be a quality assurance mechanism, but only 40 per cent of the factors dealt with excellence. The other 60 per cent actually dealt with the process; in other words, whether universities had quality assurance mechanisms in place. It was not about quality; it was whether they had the mechanisms in place. It was all about how successfully they could fill out forms and how prepared they were to jump through bureaucratic hoops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most ludicrous outcome of all was that the world-ranking University of Sydney achieved second ranking. As I pointed out the other day, the government allocated this money to one university in each state&mdash;it could not give it to two universities in New South Wales&mdash;and the University of Sydney missed out. Everyone realises that the whole situation was ludicrous and that the University of Sydney is by far ahead of a number of the other universities in level one. The silly nature of what the government has done is demonstrated by the fact that it ranked the University of Sydney second. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us congratulate the Australian National University, which achieved first ranking. There is an unintended effect of quality assurance with the John Curtin School of Medical Research. The Senate will remember that two years ago we had very serious concerns about the invasion of autonomy of the universities. At that time the government proposed to take the John Curtin medical school from the ANU and to administer it through the department of health. Following that, the administration of the John Curtin school became very complex. At a dinner I attended at the ANU two weeks ago it was said that all the problems that were created by this separate mechanism are still there and that what they would dearly love is for the whole thing to come back under DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funding is separate and therefore, when this quality assurance mechanism came about, the world-ranking John Curtin medical school certainly contributed to the assessment of the ANU as a first-class institution. The rub was that, having been part of the contribution to that, when the funding came back to the ANU there was nothing for the John Curtin medical school because it was administered through the department of health. Not only did the school lose, but the whole university lost because the amount of funding it got in total out of quality assurance was reduced proportionately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the fears we had about this funding mechanism, of administering the John Curtin School of Medical Research through Health, have come to pass. The funding of this school is yet another example of one silly government decision compounded by another silly government decision&mdash;the quality assurance mechanism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the parliament are all for quality in universities, but it must be measured in a proper way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer tonight to the national parliament of Turkey and to the detention of some Kurdish members of the parliament this month. I have heard today that they are no longer detained and that their detention was to ask questions of them. But whenever in any country there is the apparent arrest or detention of members of parliament, and in particular when there are charges that may carry the death penalty, all members of parliaments around the world should be concerned. Senator Childs spoke about this matter in the adjournment debate two nights ago. I fundamentally disagree with his assessment of the situation that he described. Tonight I wish to set out where I differ from him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech Senator Childs indicated that he was calling upon all senators to join with him `in calling on the Turkish government to immediately grant these members of parliament the rights and entitlements that they should enjoy'. On the face of it, those words seem innocent enough, but the petition that was circulated in the Senate at question time yesterday addressed these words to the Prime Minister of Turkey:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to lift the parliamentary immunity of the MPs as a result of expressing their opinions in order to fulfil their duties to their constituents causes deep anxiety and bewilderment to us. This will not make the solution of political problems easier. The Members of Parliament, as accepted universally are the representatives of their constituents. Hence any action taken against them is against the political rights of their constituents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We strongly call for the return of the parliamentary immunity of the Turkish Grand National Assembly members. Without this immunity Turkey lacks conditions where political parties can perform their activities in a democratic environment.</PARA>
<PARA>When I read those words yesterday following Senator Childs's speech the night before, I immediately decided that I could not sign such a petition to the Turkish government because it was only half right at best; it was misleading; and it failed to give any account to a number of factors that I believe should be understood when we are making an address to a foreign government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, I have five reasons why I would not urge senators to sign this controversial petition. First, the wording of the petition is derived from a lobby group within Australia. The structure and the words of the petition are not those of parliamentarians, but have the style of a lobbyist. There is an apparent logic about duty and about constituents and about rights, but that logic is superficial and misleading. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason is that I believe Senator Childs's assessment of the situation with regard to Kurdish terrorism within Turkey, as he has set out in his speech, misses the point and is not reliable. In particular he has not consulted the Turkish embassy here in Canberra to check the claims of those who have lobbied him. I had mentioned to Senator Childs that I would be speaking in this way this evening, but he must have another appointment as I see that he is not present in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that it is a courtesy and it ought to be a requirement for us to check with the accredited ambassador in this city regarding any events about which we may purport to have received information, so that we can hear what that ambassador and his government would want to say about a matter. After the facts had been checked, then we could make claims or urge senators to action within the Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last five years Turkey has become a close ally of Australia in many ways. There is a growing relationship&mdash;not only an economic relationship; an area of political understanding&mdash;and an alliance in a number of fields. I note, for example, the visit by the foreign minister of Turkey to this city earlier this month, which was a real success. It was hosted by the foreign minister of Australia, in the company of many members of the parliament from all parties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to incorporate at the end of my speech the statement about Senator Childs's speech which has been written by the Turkish Ambassador.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The third reason why I would not sign the words in the petition is that it does not refer at all to Kurdish terrorism or to the secessionist war carried out by a small minority of Turkish citizens. The Kurds represent about 10 million of the total population of about 60 million in Turkey, but the great majority of the 10 million are living in the industrialised western part of Turkey. Only a minority of Kurds live in the south-east, and only a minority of them are represented in part by the Kurdish Workers Party, the PKK, which is waging a violent secessionist war in which there have been thousands of deaths. The failure to refer to that context, I believe, disqualifies the petition in its present form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note a fourth reason for not signing the petition is that the seven Kurdish MPs who, it appears, were detained this month have been charged with acts of crime such as inciting to kill. One MP is charged with having given shelter to a PKK terrorist in his own house. The eighth MP is charged with defaming modern Turkey's founder, Ataturk, which is specifically prohibited by Turkish law. Such crimes are cited as grounds for the parliament to invoke articles 83, 84 and 85 of the Turkish constitution following a defined examination of the MPs by a parliamentary committee. MPs do retain their status during any trial. Any verdict is appealable from the State Security Court to the High Court of Appeals. Nothing of this legal context is reflected in the circulated petition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A fifth and final reason I draw the attention of honourable senators to is that, whilst it is always difficult to make international comparisons, the assessment of PKK secessionist terrorism in Turkey must bear some comparison with the IRA in the United Kingdom, the Tibetan splittists in China, the militant fundamentalists in Egypt, the recent parliamentary insurrection against the Russian government and other examples. It would be generally naive and unsound to encourage Australian parliamentarians to sign inadequate petitions that appear to signal support for one of the contending sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australian parliamentarians can only be concerned that it does appear that eight members of parliament in Turkey have been detained this month. I understand that two were almost immediately released and, as I have said, today's news is that all of them appear to be no longer in detention. It is also of concern that the parliament of Turkey appears to have voted, following constitutional procedures, to lift normal parliamentary immunity in respect of these eight MPs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by suggesting that the appropriate response would be to write to the ambassador for Turkey here in Australia in order to express our concern, to ask for an explanation, to request international observers at any trial and to insist on full accountability for the safety and fair trial of these parliamentarians. I now incorporate the document to which I referred earlier. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">TURKISH GRAND NATIONAL ASSEMBLY/ DEPUTIES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Responses to the arguments made by Senator CHILDS</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Senator Childs is arguing that the deputies have had their parliamentary immunity lifted as a result of expressing their opinions in order to fulfil their duties to their constituents. This is totally wrong. The immunities are lifted because the MP's in question are accused of acts which constitute crimes with respect to laws in Turkey, such as inciting to kill, protect terrorist criminals and acts directed to the secular foundation of the State. 7 MP's have expressed views which were provoking terror and violence. The MP's openly supported the acts of terror and violence of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) which is recognised as a terrorist organisation by many countries including Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, this argument of Senator Childs ignores the fact that the constituents of these deputies which dwell in the southeast of Turkey are intimidated by the terrorist tactics of the PKK which are very similar to those employed by Pol-Pot in the past. In fact, the terrorist organisation PKK since 1984 has claimed mostly civilian 10,000 lives including Kurdish babies and women in this southeastern part of Turkey by engaging in cross-border operations from their sanctuaries in the neighbouring countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be kept in mind that in countries ruled by democracy, the lifting of Parliamentary  immunity is as much a constitutional right as is Parliamentary immunity. The immunity of Parliamentarians in France, for example, is limited to the sessions of Parliament. Apart from these periods French parliamentarians carry penal responsibility. In fact, on 7 December 1993, the immunity of the deputy of the Socialist Party from Bouches de Rhone, Bernard Tapie was lifted by the Parliament following the report of the Parliamentary Commission and the initiation of a suit by the Public Prosecutor on charges of financial corruption. Tapie is the 5th parliamentarian whose immunity has been lifted since 1958. In Germany, the immunities of 12 parliamentarians have been lifted since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. The argument that the European Parliament has formally criticised Turkish Government. The decision of the European Parliament is based on lack of information as well as misinformation. The decision to lift the immunities was reached as the result of the voting by the representatives of the Turkish nation at the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TGNA) in accordance with article 14 of the Turkish Constitution which stipulates the conditions under which basic rights and freedoms may be restricted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, the waiving of the immunity is an act of the legislative and not of the executive organs. In accordance with the principle of separation of powers, the executive organ has no say in this matter. In fact, the TGNA, in an effort to protect its respectability and credibility, asked the judiciary to render a verdict concerning the grave accusations directed at the deputies. With its decision the TGNA has only made it possible for the judiciary to take action. It will be the independent judicial organs that will give verdict on grave accusations. The decision of the TGNA allows commencement of the legal procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the courts may be appealed. In fact, appeals have been initiated before the Constitutional Court against the decision of the lifting of immunities. The Constitutional Court will give a decision within two weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Turkish Parliament has acted scrupulously in full awareness of its great responsibility in taking its decision. With its decision the Turkish Parliament has defended the constitution and democracy. It has at the same time cleared the path of independent judiciary for the protection of the State against terror, separatism and religious fundamentalism, by preventing certain MP's abusing their parliamentary immunities as a shield.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All these facts also make it clear that the decision to lift the immunities is taken by the TGNA and the military is not involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. The argument that seven of these members of Parliament have campaigned for greater autonomy for Kurds in Turkey and the eighth has criticised the secular nature of the modern Turkish State ignores the fact that the accusations made by the TGNA against the deputies involve offences related to territorial integrity and the basic principles of the Sate, such as secularism as well as offences in the form of expression with the potential to acquire the form of actions such as to incite to commit crime through propaganda or give encouragement for crime. No freedom is unlimited. The European Convention on Human Rights foresees the limitation by law of the freedom of thought and expression for the sake of national security, territorial integrity and public safety.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parliamentarian cannot be expected to fulfil his/her duties under serious accusations. For this reason, the parliamentarians in question have been given an opportunity to prove themselves innocent through judiciary means. This was, in fact, necessary to enable the said parliamentarians as well as the Grand National Assembly to carry out their tasks effectively. This was also necessary for the people not to lose their belief in democracy and in the Grand National Assembly of Turkey.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. The argument that these parliamentarians will be charged under article 125 of the anti-terror law: First of all, the article in question is not an article of the anti-terror law. It is an article of the Turkish Penal Code which deals with actions against the indivisibility of the State and nation. Article 125 of the Turkish Penal Code itself is based on article 14 of the Turkish Constitution which stipulates that the basic rights and freedoms as indicated in the Constitution cannot be used against the integrity of the state and endanger its very existence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, article 14 of the Turkish Constitution, like the constitutions of all civilised countries, reflect the universal principles included in the European Convention as explained above. The same Convention states that nothing in the said Convention may be interpreted as implying a freedom to engage in any activity or perform any act aimed at the destruction of any of the rights and freedoms stated. The Constitution of Federal Germany, for example, contains similar provision and the German Penal Code, in its articles 81 and 82, sanctions imprisonment ranging between 10 years and life for such crimes under the heading "Treason against the federal state." Furthermore the European Convention of Human Rights also makes clear distinction between the freedom of thought and freedom of expression, codifying that states may take necessary measures to prevent the abuse of the freedom of thought, as well as to protect the state against separatism.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. The argument that the death penalty will be requested is an oversimplification of the legal proceedings stated in the laws and the Constitution of Turkey. Indeed the violation of the State's territorial integrity involves the death penalty as the maximum penalty for those who are charged with this crime. Penalties, however, will be considerably reduced if no act within the meaning of article 125 is accomplished and if this act remains in the form of provocation or incitement. On the other hand, all acts and actions of the administration are subject to judicial appeal and review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">6. The argument that the 7 Kurdish Parliamentarians represent a large minority 10 million people is wrong. The deputies in question elected from the south eastern provinces of Turkey do not represent the Kurdish origin people but the whole of the nation. In fact, article 80 of the Turkish Constitution stipulates that the MP's do not represent their constituency or their electors but the whole of the Turkish nation. Moreover, large number of the Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin live in the western provinces of Turkey. In fact Istanbul today is the province with the largest number of Kurdish origin people living in Turkey. In addition, in the parliament almost 150 MP's are of Kurdish origin. Many Turkish citizens of Kurdish origin occupy prominent positions in all areas of public life. We have had even ministers and prime ministers of Kurdish origins.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">7. The argument that since 1984 many of those died in the conflict between the Turkish military and Kurdish separatist have been civilians&mdash;neglects to mention that the main targets of the terrorist organisation Kurdistan Workers Party-PKK are the civilians. The civilians who have died in the conflicts, in fact, are the victims of the PKK. The aim of the PKK is to intimidate the local population through employing terrorist tactics and thereby gain some degree of ostensible support. As a result of PKK's terrorist attacks since 1984 more than 3000 civilians have lost their lives and the majority of these are of Kurdish origin. The PKK also in an effort to deter the Turkish Government from bringing social and economic services to the region, attacks hospitals, trains, buses, touristic installations, development projects. In fact, the PKK is the greatest perpetrator of human rights. It is, therefore, basic duty of the government to guarantee the protection of its citizens lives and property against the PKK terror organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The combat of the Turkish State with the terror organisation, however, is presented by certain groups or interests as the terror of the security forces with the aim of misleading the international public opinion to achieve their goals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments of Senator Childs are ill-informed to say the least. The Embassy of the Republic of Turkey calls on all the honourable members of the Parliament not to be misled by the terrorist propaganda and support the rule of law and constitutional democracy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Labor Party, of course, is always anxious to save its members from the truth being known about them. As I was saying, as if what he has been doing is not enough, his latest invention is to use blatant untruths and misleading statements in television advertising. He makes absolutely false claims&mdash;and if that is not lying, Senator Sherry can correct me&mdash;in his advertisements, saying, `The Liberals want you to pay more and more', and that water rates will rise by 70 per cent. They are absolute and unmitigated lies. The Labor council would probably raise rates, if Mayor Mooney's federal mate's&mdash;that is, Mr Keating's&mdash;track record on tax hikes is anything to go by. The Labor Mayor of Townsville could certainly relate to sports rorts, whiteboard accounting and the sandwich shop fiasco, as it has recently been revealed that his previous campaign received a substantial donation from a company doing developmental work in Townsville to which favours could be given, and the donation was conveniently not accounted for. Mayor Mooney and Mrs Kelly obviously went to the same corrupt accounting school. It is evident that Labor, at all levels of government, cannot be trusted with money.

The beach has been closed and people have been instructed not to swim in the ocean. Crime has sky-rocketed, with a wave of burglaries, bashings and vandalism. It is so bad in Townsville at the moment that army personnel have been advised not to walk in the mall at night. If diggers cannot walk down the street in safety, what type of place is it?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) With the establishment of the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), the former Department of Transport and Communications retained the ownership of a number of "off airport" houses occupied by FAC staff. The ongoing transfer of aerodromes to local authorities under the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP) also left the former Department with further "off airport" residences occupied by its own employees. In consultation with the FAC and the unions the former Department adopted the following principles in respect to disposal of excess "off airport" housing:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) The existing tenant would be given the opportunity to purchase</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) A valuation of the property would be obtained</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d) An adjustment to the valuation was made to take account of the fact that minimal costs would be incurred by the former Department for advertising, inspections, commissions etc. In the case of properties sold to former Departmental staff tenants, the purchaser received a $3000 discount plus the inclusion of departmental whitegoods or furnishings allocated to the dwelling. FAC staff who purchased a former Departmental dwelling received the $3000 plus an FAC incentive discount of $4000.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(e) A further adjustment to the valuation would be made to account for tenant provided improvements e.g. garage, garden shed, etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)-(7) Table A shows properties sold in the Regions where it was possible for Canberra Office to access information.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the ALOP policy, where ownership of an aerodrome has transferred from the Commonwealth to full local ownership, the houses, buildings and facilities on the aerodrome have been transferred to the relevant local authority at no charge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">National Transmission Agency (NTA)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(2) NTA policy for disposal of houses (and other real estate) is to assign the task to the Australian Property Group (APG), to sell by auction, tender or open sale.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prices varied depending on whether the house was on its own block (usually in a nearby town), or was to be removed from a broadcasting site. In the latter case, prices also varied according to whether this allowed the house to be re-located elsewhere, such as Emerald, or was being demolished for materials, such as at Beresfield. Some of these houses were also in poor condition. In all cases, APG paid the proceeds into Consolidated Revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) None of these houses were sold to NBB staff.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Some properties have been sold by public auction at Port Augusta but none in recent times.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary it is AN's policy to dispose of houses in areas where alternative accommodation is available for AN staff. In general, tenants of houses are encouraged and have first option to purchase the house that they occupy. Where an interest is expressed to purchase, a valuation is carried out by a licensed valuer whose valuation is used to arrive at a selling price which reflects the current market rates and the condition of the property.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where a house is vacant it is placed on the open market either directly by AN or through a Real Estate Agent.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIA POST</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(2) Since 1 January 1983 Australia Post has had a staff housing policy of offering to existing tenants, staff houses which are either surplus to requirements or are uneconomic from an Australia Post point of view because of the high operating costs such as the maintenance and administrative expenses involved in providing them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The properties offered for sale are valued at current market value by independent registered valuers.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CIVIL AVIATION AUTHORITY (CAA)</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)-(2) The CAA has traditionally owned houses at the more remote locations within Australia to meet the needs of specialist staff who were transferred to these locations to meet particular operational needs. These staff were sent to these locations for limited terms (on Term Transfer) and paid a number of allowances to assist them in these temporary moves. The CAA provided housing in these circumstances because there was little or no suitable rental accommodation available in these locations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently there has been a marked improvement in some rental markets and reorganisations within the CAA have resulted in reductions in the numbers of staff in many locations. As a result, the number of houses required by the CAA has reduced from in excess of 400 to about 60 nationally, and these excess houses were identified for disposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sale of excess houses direct to staff provided a number of financial benefits to the CAA, including:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an encouragement to staff generally to purchase houses and for Term Transfer (TT) staff in particular to forego Term Transfer and reduce CAA's costs, concessional benefits were offered as a deduction from the sale price for each house.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Australia has been offered and accepted the role of Partner Country at CeBIT'95, to be held in Hannover, Germany, 8-15 March 1995. Austrade sees the Partner Country status as a uniquely valuable opportunity to promote Australian Information Technology and Telecommunications capability on a global stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) CeBIT is one of the world's largest trade fairs, and is by far the largest trade event for the Information Technology or the Telecommunications industries, as well as the most comprehensive in terms of the range of products covered. CeBIT'95 is expected to attract over 600,000 visitors from 100 countries, some 6,000 exhibitors from 50 countries, and 7,000 journalists. CeBIT has grown every year since it was started in 1986, and has become a global event with 100,000 visitors from outside Germany and 35,000 from the Asia Pacific region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The cost of participation in CeBIT'95 is currently estimated at $A2.2 million. The Austrade Board has allocated $1,050,000 to Austrade's "InTelligent Australia" promotion at CeBIT. Austrade expects to receive financial contributions from the governments of NSW, VIC, QLD, SA, WA, ACT together with space rental contributions from individual company exhibitors, and sponsorships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) In the short term, Austrade forecasts&mdash;conservatively&mdash;that Australian exhibitors will realise at least $150 million in orders resulting from CeBIT'94 and `95 (based on reports from exhibitors from 1986 to 1993). More importantly, CeBIT'95 should result in at least 50 leading-edge Australian IT companies being permanently established in overseas markets, through subsidiaries, joint ventures, distributors, or strategic partners. In the longer term, CeBIT'95 and the promotions, market research, planning and export activities that  precede and follow it, will help energise the Australian IT industry and help focus it on the international markets where it is competitive. Austrade's ultimate objective is to dramatically and permanently raise world-wide awareness of Australia as a source of technological excellence and a business and investment destination.</PARA>
