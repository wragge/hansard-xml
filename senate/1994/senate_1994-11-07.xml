<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, and it concerns the government's policy of forcing up interest rates. The last time the current account deficit began registering monthly deficits of $2 billion, which was five years ago, home loan mortgage rates hit 17 per cent. Is it because the current account is again registering monthly deficits of $2 billion that Mr Keating has now said that the recent rises in housing interest rates are `the rises we had to have'? In view of this trend, will the minister categorically deny that home mortgage rates, which are now at 9.5 per cent, will not reach rates of 14 and 15 per cent, as they did last time? If that is not so, what is the government's expectation of housing interest rates in this cycle?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2425" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Housing mortgage rates clearly directly relate to short-term cash rates, and it is the case that those shorter term rates have been going up. They have risen by 1.75 per cent since mid-August. It is clearly appropriate, in the light of the evidence that is rapidly accumulating about the pick-up in the economy, that we should be taking this action now. There are no signs of inflationary take-off. But with the economy as buoyant as it now is, it is only a matter of time before inflation breaks out unless we take action now to control it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving now on monetary policy, as we have been doing, will result in the least increases in interest rates that could possibly occur over the course of the business cycle. Given the low inflation fundamentals that are now locked into the economy, interest rates simply will not need to rise to the same extent as they have in past cycles. We will certainly not have the same interest rate levels in housing or anywhere else as we had in the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are committed to keeping the underlying rate of inflation to around two or three per cent over the course of the economic cycle. Obviously, maintaining low inflation is absolutely critical to the sustainability of growth, which remains the central objective. So that is the reason for this action and let us not lose sight of it: it is because the economy is going like a train, which we all want it to do. Beyond that, I think the answer does not need to go into any more detail. I have pages and pages of detail, which I am happy to share with the honourable senator and the Senate, but I think Senator Hill would probably prefer to talk about something else.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The point that the minister does not seem to want to appreciate is that this is exactly the same pattern as occurred on the last occasion. The current account has started to blow out; it is back out to $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion&mdash;some of the worst figures on record. On the last occasion the minister said that the government had to force up interest rates to dampen demand, the result of which was that much of small business was crushed in this country and life was made so much more difficult for house owners. The same pattern is occurring. The government is deliberately forcing up interest rates; housing interest rates are following commercial interest rates.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is obviously the case that the opposition has no alternative policy of its own. It has never had a policy that is remotely credible or, if it is halfway credible in terms of doing something on the fiscal policy front, the opposition is absolutely unwilling to spell out the details for the obvious reason that it does not know where to begin to cut further in a way that would go further than what the government has been able to achieve. We will continue to be responsible, as we already have been, on the fiscal front, and there is absolutely no reason to believe that we should, at this stage, be doing more on that fiscal front than we are at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response on the monetary policy front always has to run hand in hand with what one is doing on the fiscal front. If we try to put all our eggs in one particular policy basket we are bound to fall flat on our faces and break that particular basket of eggs. The truth of the matter is that we have a deficit reduction strategy that makes perfect economic sense; a deficit reduction strategy that will take what is already a low proportion of GDP deficit down to a considerably lower one than has been able to be matched by any of the other OECD economies, within a tighter time frame than has been able to be matched by any one of those other economies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a responsible policy. We are not saying it is the last word on the subject. We will be prepared to look at it further in the context of planning for the next budget.

I ask the minister this question because of conflicting reports in recent weeks about the number of drought-stricken farming families who are seeking assistance under the federal government's drought relief payment scheme. Can the minister advise the Senate of the extent to which the scheme has been taken up among those farming families in Queensland and New South Wales?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2426" SPEAKER="Collins Sen The Hon R.L." NAMEID="OF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NT" MINISTERIAL="PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The implementation of the scheme and, more importantly, its uptake have both been swift. I should remind the Senate that the drought relief payment scheme was given cabinet approval barely six weeks ago. The first payments in fact started to flow the day after the legislation was passed by this parliament. The scheme itself has basically been running for about four weeks. As of last Friday, the rural assistance authorities in Queensland and New South Wales had issued nearly 9,000 certificates to farming families in areas of exceptional drought. Following the issuing of those certificates, 3,796 applications have subsequently been received by DSS offices. In fact, I was told just before I came into question time that that figure is now closer to 4,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far 1,514 have been approved for payment, with those payments, as I have just said, commencing the day after the legislation passed through this parliament. The approval rate on applications is currently running at 91 per cent. Given the huge administrative task involved, the speedy implementation of the scheme is a credit to all DPIE and DSS officers who have been involved in administering it. My ministerial colleague Peter Baldwin and I are closely monitoring the implementation of the scheme to ensure that any problems are resolved quickly and that assistance is kept flowing effectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Baldwin visited drought affected areas last week to talk to farmers and DSS staff on how the package is being implemented on the ground. The government has also today released details of further support measures for families in areas of exceptional drought in Queensland and New South Wales. There is no question that the severity of the drought is placing enormous pressure on families. The government has committed an additional $445,000 to provide additional crisis counselling services. The social counsellors have been appointed in addition to the financial counsellors. DSS officers already on the ground will ensure that farmers can cut through any red tape in assessing these benefits.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Defence. I draw the attention of the minister to the, at best, naive or, at worst, wilfully misleading comments made by Senator Gareth Evans on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program yesterday when he set out to downplay the dangerous military threat posed by the Khmer Rouge.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UI4">Senator ROBERT RAY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have already seen these views in Senator Newman's grubby and opportunistic press release put out yesterday. The fact is that I totally concur with Senator Evans's assessment of the Khmer Rouge, which was not dismissive of them but said that they number between 5,000 and 8,000 cadres and another 8,000 support people. All the evidence we have had from intelligence and other things has supported that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same questions were asked during the election period in Cambodia, when Australia was criticised for putting forward the view that the Khmer Rouge did not have the capacity to totally disrupt those elections. We were criticised, not necessarily in this parliament, but by others saying, `Why would you send observers into such a dangerous position when the Khmer Rouge are so strong?' The fact is that the Khmer Rouge have weakened over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a factor that they remain a fundamental problem because of the incapacity of the Cambodian defence force to mount effective operations against them. And that is very much a function of the Cambodian defence force, consisting of three factional groups merged into one&mdash;inheriting some 2,000 generals, low pay, low morale and low discipline&mdash;and trying to reform and develop itself into a force that can effectively combat this terrorist regime that exists in parts of Cambodia. That is the situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans's assessment is absolutely right, as was the now Lieutenant General John Sanderson's assessment two years ago when other countries believed he was wrong. It is not a question as to whether the Khmer Rouge are a large and dangerous group; it is the amount of countervailing force that can be brought against them. That is what the international community has to consider. It does not have to consider opportunistic scaremongering press releases implying that we are going to send peace enforcement operators to Cambodia, as Senator Newman's press release yesterday said. She should go back and read that press release&mdash;Senator Newman put her name to it&mdash;and withdraw it as a disgraceful document that adds nothing to the consideration of international affairs.</PARA>

I refer the minister to previous announcements he has made about extensions of stay for visitors from the former Yugoslavia and Sri Lanka, given the state of unrest which still exists in their homelands.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must thank Senator Zakharov for this question. I know that the honourable senator has raised this issue with me on a number of occasions over the last 15 months or so, and the fact that she raises it again today is another reflection of her interest in what is, indeed, an important issue, particularly for the 1,000 or so people from Sri Lanka and former Yugoslavia who are in the situation to which she refers and who, because of that situation, remain uncertain about their futures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Zakharov mentioned, on a number of occasions in the last year or so I have made statements about extending the stay of people who have arrived in Australia as visitors, and also for other temporary residence, from both Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia but who, of course, have not been able to return home because of continuing conflict in their homelands. In fact, on 10 June this year I announced an extension of their visas until 30 November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This measure recognised, in the case of people from Sri Lanka, that while the standard of human rights there was improving, the situation was still sufficiently uncertain enough to warrant offering a further extension of stay. Similarly, in respect of people from the former Yugoslavia, it was clearly difficult, if not in fact impossible, for those people to return to their home countries while the fighting there continued. So we have extended the capacity for those people to stay in Australia until 30 November.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, we have been closely monitoring the situation in both of those countries and, because of that monitoring, I have decided that it would still be unreasonable to expect these people to return home at the present time. They will therefore be offered a further extension of their visas until 31 March 1995. This will apply, of course, to all citizens of both countries who are normally resident there and who have held a valid entry permit at any time on or after 31 December 1991. This will include some 500 people from Sri Lanka and just over 500 from the former Yugoslavia&mdash;people who currently hold these extended temporary visas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, I should mention that a number of these people have applied for permanent residence under the series of measures that the government announced on 1 November last year. Their applications are currently being processed and the present extension, the one I have just announced, will ensure that those who are not eligible for permanent residence under that visa category will not be required to return while the conflict persists. The next step is for all these people involved to approach the nearest immigration office for information after 30 November.</PARA>

That is correct. The export of woodchips from minor species wood from Tasmanian forests is permitted under the Commonwealth export licences, which Senator Bell was advised. The wood is not specifically targeted for pulpwood and it is usually sold as part of a composite woodchip product.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from reneging on the 1992 memorandum of understanding, Australia is trying to carry it through to its logical conclusion: a genuinely integrated single market in which the aviation industries of both countries effectively become one, which is the ultimate goal. Until we are satisfied that New Zealand shares this objective, we are not prepared to keep giving away rights that are benefiting only Air New Zealand at the expense of our own airlines. I am sorry that Senator Parer has a different view. In the meantime, we are taking nothing away from Air New Zealand that it is not already using. The single aviation market has been substantially progressed over the last two years with generous on-flying rights granted to Air New Zealand.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator West for her question. The Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, has announced that as from 1 December consumers will have a greater say when it comes to the drugs they use and the price they pay for them. Under the changes that were passed in this parliament in August, consumers will be able to ask their pharmacist to substitute a cheaper generic brand of drug than the name brand prescribed by their doctor. There are about 120 listed drugs in the pharmaceutical benefits scheme which have a cheaper generic substitute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government estimates that this will result in significant savings to consumers&mdash;this is especially important for those on low incomes&mdash;and it will not in any way compromise the quality or safety of the care provided. Indeed, many of these generic drugs are currently being used in hospital pharmacies across the country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation allows doctors to write `not for substitution' across the prescription if they have a reason to indicate that they feel a patient needs a particular brand of a particular drug and none other. An example of that may be patients who are allergic to some brands of medication and not to others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some good reasons why GPs should choose one brand over another. However, there is no justification at all for so many doctors, as well as the AMA, wanting to oppose the move to generic substitution. I suppose in some ways it is clearly evident that this will blow apart a very cosy arrangement between some providers of pharmaceuticals and some parts of the medical profession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me quote Bob Allan, the vice-president of the Australian Association of General Practitioners, who gave this description of how doctors choose which drug to prescribe:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You prescribe a particular product because of the relationship which the professional develops with the pharmaceutical manufacturer's representative. They provide a lot of educational support.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Allan said that by prescribing cheaper drugs he would be discouraging the development of new drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Colin Johns, the retiring federal president of the Australian Pharmacy Guild, said it much more directly and much more clearly when picking up on the AMA's decision to oppose generic substitution. Colin Johns described the response of the AMA as `blatant, arrogant self-interest on behalf of the doctors who enjoy fringe benefits from drug companies in the form of substantial free samples, free accommodation, travel to seminars and other bonuses.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why on earth would the AMA be opposing this proposal? Even Mrs Bishop supports the substitution of generic drugs. She has now come to that view; she has made it clear. So what on earth is the reason for the AMA opposing it? It will be better for consumers; it will be cheaper for the consumers; in no way is it going to interfere with the quality or safety of medication; and it will give consumers more choice and more information. Many doctors are prepared to support it, but the AMA has come out and opposed it. One can only say in the end that it is afraid of losing the cosy deals, arrangements and support which have been given to so many doctors over the years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to see the opposition give very clear support to its spokesperson on health, who is supporting the substitution of generic brands.

It is the normal process, of course, to call on defence resources when all state resources are expended and no more are available.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had the pleasure this morning of being involved in a ceremony held at the Shortlands Wetlands Centre where two very significant Ramsar wetland sites were formally linked&mdash;one on the island of Hokkaido in Japan and the other in Newcastle. Senators would be aware that the Ramsar convention is an intergovernmental treaty which provides the framework for international cooperation on the conservation of internationally significant wetlands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Japanese site includes the Kushiro Marsh, which is a unique breeding ground for migratory birds. The other Ramsar site is the Kooragang Nature Reserve and associated wetlands in the Hunter Valley. It is where these birds, particularly the latham snipe, migrate to during the northern winter. Protection of this bird, the latham snipe, relies on the preservation of wetland habitats in Japan and Australia. The two countries, specifically the wetlands which were linked this morning, provide the critical habitat for this particular bird.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The linking of these two Ramsar sites highlights the importance for both countries of protecting internationally valuable wetland sites. Japan and Australia are both very active players in the Ramsar convention. In 1993 Kushiro hosted the fifth conference of the contracting parties to the Ramsar convention. The next contracting parties convention will be held in Brisbane in early 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has not historically had a good record in protecting our wetlands. Since European settlement more than 50 per cent of our wetlands have been either degraded or destroyed. Declining water quality is an increasing problem. It is in part caused by the destruction of so many of our wetlands which have acted as a filtering system for our water. Over the next two years in the lead-up to the 1996 Ramsar conference, the Commonwealth will be working cooperatively with state and local governments to improve the management of our internationally important wetlands and to list more of our internationally significant wetlands in the Ramsar convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last month I announced a special allocation of funds to improve the management of Australia's 42 listed Ramsar sites.

A mechanism has been put in place whereby Senator McKiernan and Mr Steve Smith will put those submissions to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is very important to keep in mind that the decision was taken to set up a new MRC to replace the North Perth MRC and to set up the new one in the northern corridor eight or so kilometres further north than the North Perth MRC in perhaps one of the fastest population growth areas, in terms of local government areas, anywhere in Australia. It is for me a decision based on the best use of resources, and it is a decision that, I must say, has already been welcomed by communities representing the Vietnamese, the Burmese, the Indians, the Sri Lankans and so on. So there is some recognition of a need for the MRC to go further out. There is also recognition by communities involved that needs are not being met.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some reviews.

Obviously, I do not condone that sort of action, but I do say to Senator Knowles that when we come to this particular issue it is best for all of us to look at it in the broad context as to where resources would be best used. In my estimation, the best use of these resources is in those areas of fastest growth some eight or so kilometres from the North Perth MRC.

<PARA>The saga of the current Air New Zealand debacle, whereby this government has repudiated a memorandum of understanding, goes back to February 1992 when a major feature of the One Nation package was to have a single aviation market between Australia and New Zealand. In fact, the One Nation statement made great play of this. There were stories abounding at the time that probably a reason for it was that the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) felt no allegiance to the old management of Ansett, therefore did not have any loyalties to Ansett and was not in there to protect it, hence, the single aviation market. The single aviation market made sense from a lot of angles because it meant more competition on the domestic market, more international competition, more tourists being brought into Australia and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the then minister, Senator Collins, issued a statement which outlined in great detail the government's position. He made the point in his document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian aviation: toward the 21st century</EMPHASIS> that this was a major step forward for Australia. He said that the new aviation policy would allow competition for Qantas on  international services and new domestic competition from Qantas and New Zealand operators, and provide for the integration of the Australian and New Zealand aviation markets. The new policy would provide benefits for travellers and encourage the development of a more robust, integrated, internationally competitive economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequently, the minister signed a memorandum of understanding with the Minister for Transport from New Zealand, Mr Rob Storey, on 1 August 1992. The basis of that agreement carried forward the One Nation statement so that it picked up a slow build-up of the services being able to be offered by New Zealand carriers and subsequently by Australian carriers. It had a phased program allowing this to occur by 1 November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Out of the blue, the minister responsible for aviation, Mr Brereton, only some four or five days before the due date of 1 November 1994, sent a letter to the minister for transport in New Zealand, saying that the Australian government had decided, in the light of developments, that it could not agree to amend the air service agreement to allow domestic access in terms of paragraph 3G of the memorandum of understanding. That in itself was a dishonest statement because it says that the government could not agree to amend the air service agreement. That agreement specifically stated that Air New Zealand would be able to operate domestically from 1 November 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am interested to see Senator Gareth Evans here. This was a memorandum of understanding. Certainly, it did not have the force of a legal agreement but a memorandum of understanding is a very important document. I wonder whether the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) or Minister Brereton consulted Senator Evans when they repudiated the memorandum of understanding, which is what they did. Excuses were given. Everyone in the industry knows that the excuses are just red herrings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason given was that the agreements in respect of ownership and control had not been expanded.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ownership and control clause in the memorandum of understanding was introduced by the New Zealand government because it did not want an agreement between two countries that could get it into difficulties if one of the airlines, either Australian or New Zealand, was taken over by another international airline. That was to be the basis of the discussion, not some forced marriage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of questions need to be answered. Why did the Prime Minister go to bat to force a marriage between Air New Zealand and Ansett? Who asked him to do it? What were the benefits in doing so? Why should a Prime Minister get involved in commercial negotiations when he had nothing whatsoever to do with them? This matter is a disgrace. I would be interested in Senator Evans advising us sometime whether he was aware that an agreement of this magnitude, which relates to the whole of the CER agreement, was ever referred to him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not surprising, of course, that this memorandum of understanding was organised while Senator Collins was the Minister for Transport. He has been an abject failure in every portfolio he has touched in the last four years, and so that does not come as a surprise to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise a couple of other issues very briefly. One is the number of jobs that have been lost as a result of the last minute decision by the government to renege on this particular agreement. Hundreds of young people in Brisbane lined up for jobs with Air New Zealand because Brisbane was going to be the hub of the proposed arrangement. Many of these young people were unemployed and were looking forward to having a job in the tourism-aviation industry. That all fell to pieces when the government pulled the rug on the agreement at the very last minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter relates to my disappointment that there will not be another airline competing in the domestic market. I look back with some wistfulness at the tremendous strides taken by Australian aviation when Compass flew. I know in particular that Cairns and the Cairns tourism industry just boomed in the period when Compass was flying. I was looking forward to another boom in tourism and in domestic air travel around our country with the greater competition that a third domestic airline would have brought. All of that now seems to be to no avail. We are left with the two airlines again with very little competition between them. What could have been a great step forward for tourism and very moderately priced airline travel around Australia has gone wanting because this government simply cannot make a decision. It is dictated to by others outside this parliament and, again, it is the Australian people who suffer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In quick response to the New Zealand matter that is generating so much excitement from the opposition benches, it needs to be appreciated that there were two quite specific provisions in the memorandum of understanding in paragraphs (G) and (H) respectively that did quite explicitly make the question of full access to domestic markets:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The memorandum does not spell out what the desired outcome of such consultations were.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The truth of the matter is that Prime Ministers Keating and Bolger discussed the issue as recently as July of this year. Both sides agreed that the desired outcome was a rationalisation with the two-airline aviation policy. Mr Bolger, of course, wanted one of those two airlines to be the New Zealand national carrier. There have been no formal discussions on the issue since that time and certainly no resolution of the question in a way that is satisfactory to the Australian side. For those reasons alone, quite apart from any other consideration&mdash;a number of them have been canvassed&mdash;it is quite inappropriate to suggest that there has been any walking away from the terms of the MOU. The Australian government does not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other policy considerations that came into play.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Ray), to a question without notice asked by Senator Newman this day, relating to Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge.</PARA>
<PARA>I am absolutely amazed at the outburst from the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) over a very legitimate question that I asked and a press release that I issued yesterday. I was described as being opportunistic by Senator Ray in a rush of blood to the head that is quite incomprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not a question of whether Cambodia should be supported in trying to defeat the Khmer Rouge and to establish effective government in the country, but it is all about what that support should be. We in the opposition support defence aid and we support other help but, as with the rest of Australians, we have a legitimate claim to want to know what the government's assessment of the military position is so that our response can be assessed and, if possible, agreed to on a bipartisan basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my press statement yesterday I asked Senator Ray to make a statement about what the government intended. I did not suggest we were sending peacekeepers. I asked whether we would end up sending peace enforcers&mdash;a reasonable question, I would have thought.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arrogance of the minister in telling the Senate that the government would decide what it was going to do and then would inform us all in due course when it saw fit is pretty breathtaking, in my view. It is not acceptable. Both Senators Gareth Evans and Ray should make full statements to the Senate now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand Senator Ray is intending to respond to what I have to say, but we are looking for specific detail of assessments, not the sort of airy-fairy stuff that we got yesterday morning on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. Whatever Senator Ray said today, it does not diminish the transparent attempt of Senator Evans to downplay the military position. The only reason that he has done this has to be that he cannot bring himself to accept the reality that when the UN left Cambodia after the elections the Khmer Rouge may have been smaller in number but its influence and fighting capability was still very dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in this does not stem just from my action yesterday in criticising Senator Evans for being muddled in his explanations and soft on the capacity of the Khmer Rouge in his interview on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> show. My interest in this comes from a long interest in the Cambodian situation. I seek leave to table a report I made on the Cambodian situation after I visited it just before the elections in 1992. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I furnished a copy of this to the then Minister for Administrative Services, but I did not make it public because of its sensitivity and because of my wish to do nothing to disturb the election process. Senator Evans can make faces, but that was the reality of it. I spoke privately to individuals concerned and I gave the government a copy of my report. I stated in my summing up:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am somewhat pessimistic about the outcome in Cambodia. The continued intransigence of the Khmer Rouge and the importance of the strategic areas they occupy, the serious, almost complete deficiency of civilian infrastructure in the country, the lack of controls on the Thai border, the increasing banditry and corruption, the fierce hatred of the Vietnamese and the passive non-intervention policy of UNTAC to date make the long term outcomes very doubtful and at the best extremely difficult. I acknowledge however, that Untac appears to be treading a stronger line since I left the country.</PARA>
<PARA>I ended up saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I fear that the final outcome will see either a country dominated by the Khmer Rouge or a return to fighting and a divided country, whether an election takes place or not.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not like pointing out that that was right. But Senator Ray bothers me because he bridles at being asked to be accountable to the parliament. I simply asked a number of specific questions. I asked for a statement of an assessment of the military capabilities of the Khmer Rouge. I asked for a full, frank and realistic statement of the assessment in the parliament. I asked what Senator Evans's statements on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program implied in terms of defence aid to Cambodia. And I asked: does this mean a commitment of our forces to a peace enforcing role in a guerilla war?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that Minister Ray does not live to rue the day that he ignored the warnings of the opposition about being sucked into a guerilla war. We do not know what he is intending because he is keeping us all in the dark. The big lesson of guerilla warfare is that small numbers of guerillas supported by the local population can hold a large force down for many years, dislocating all life in the countryside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition does recognise the importance of regional security, but we expect the government to be up-front about the true situation, not to call the opposition spokesman opportunistic for telling it as it is. The fact is that it is not so very different from 1992, and that gave me cause for concern then. The government should at least be open with the parliament of Australia before it starts making plans for what aid, or military aid in particular, it is preparing to give to Cambodia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Newman really did deserve all the walloping she got from Senator Ray during question time today because it was a remarkably silly press release, as well as being a misconceived one, that was put out yesterday. Let me give just one example. She says early on in the release:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Senator Evans to claim that the Cambodian Government has scored a significant victory over the Khmer Rouge mountain stronghold, and to dismiss the number of Khmer Rouge fighting men as a mere handful of 5000 or 8000, displays an unbelievable optimism, or ignorance of the realities of a guerilla war.</PARA>
<PARA>Can I draw attention to a couple of things&mdash;first of all, as to what I actually said yesterday. I fully acknowledged the impact that even a quite small fighting force of guerillas can have on the country. I will read, for example, one relevant quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's amazing what kind of results you can achieve with guerilla operations if they're tightly, professionally run and controlled&mdash;how much havoc you can wreak, even with relatively small numbers.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If at the same time the government personnel&mdash;military personnel&mdash;out in the countryside is creating a reputation for itself for corruption, incompetence and worse, then in that kind of environment clearly even very small numbers can do damage beyond what one might think possible.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on from that to talk about the need for reconsideration of military assistance. That is the general point to make. Of course we acknowledge the force of the argument. We all watched, we all witnessed, the Vietnam war being carried on for so many years by a numerically smaller body. But also in the particular context of the Vine mountain assault, it just happens to be the case, whatever reservations or worries we might have about the accompanying course of events as they possibly impacted upon the hostages, that the military action there embarked upon, which involved an encirclement and ultimately assault upon the mountain combined with a strategy of offering amnesty and encouraging defection, did produce a situation where that particular stronghold was wiped out, with some hundreds of soldiers and, I think, close to a thousand people overall&mdash;we still have not seen the final figures&mdash;back under government control as a result of that particular exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is at least a start, and an indication of the kind of operation that might sensibly be mounted in the future. It is one thing just to have a guerilla operation which simply leaves a spot and regroups to fight again another day, but to have people actually changing sides and coming into the government ambit as a result of an operation of that kind is to have an indication of the sort of thing which can happen in the future and which will, I believe, be able to happen in the future when the military gets its act together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman, for the opposition, has been yelping for further information from the government. Let me say firstly that quite a lot of information is already on the public record about the nature of our response to the Wilson case in particular and our general assessment of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to take the opportunity to seek leave not only to table but to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> my press release expressing the government's profound and sincere condolences to the Wilson family on 2 November for the appalling death of David, and the detailed documents and accompanying transcript that were released at the media conference the following day.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CAMBODIA: AN INTERNATIONAL RESPONSIBILITY</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.However fragile and vulnerable Cambodia may continue to be, the country is in infinitely better shape now, just one year into the life of its new government, than it was just a few short years ago when there was a full-scale civil war raging supported on each side by major external powers, no internationally recognised government, no constitution, no infrastructure, no financial assistance from the international community and no hope.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.We will have to give Cambodia time, certainly some years, before it is really off the danger list. But I firmly believe that, through its own efforts and international assistance, Cambodia will cross that threshold and emerge with real prospects for long term stability and economic prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.It is suggested in some quarters that I have painted too glowing a picture of the Cambodia which emerged last year from the peace process. In the period between September last year, when the new government took office, and early April this year, there was good evidence that, with numerous defections occurring from the Khmer Rouge, with a coalition government in place that had worked out a modus vivendi and seemed, against all the odds, to be putting behind it the bitter enmities that had characterised its members' past dealings with each other, that Cambodia, while faced with absolutely enormous problems of reconstruction and lack of infrastructure which were the legacy of the twenty or so years of conflict, was on the road to permanent peace and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.When I visited Cambodia in early April 1994, things seemed to me, and to every international observer with whom I spoke, to be very much on the right track&mdash;at least within the limitations of what might be expected from a country emerging from twenty years of war, civil war, genocide, invasion, and civil war again. I also saw it as important, then as now, not to unnecessarily or gratuitously undermine the tentatively emerging self-confidence of the new Cambodian leadership that it could in fact cope with the massive challenges it was facing: I had some words of warning, as well as encouragement, but they were uttered privately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.My optimism, and that of many in the international community, was severely challenged by the military debacle of the fall of Pailin which occurred on 19 April. These events were of course major psychological setbacks for the government itself. After that time, we started to hear more of stagnation and inactivity in government; of disarray in the armed forces which had been responsible for the military disasters; of a resurgence of corruption; and of the Khmer Rouge making inroads again&mdash;not because they were numerically strong or were winning vast numbers of Cambodians to their policies, but because the armed forces were performing badly, were untrained and were incapable of earning the respect of the people they were supposed to be protecting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.It became clear after April, to a much greater extent than before, that not only did the country need massive amounts of development assistance for the purposes of reconstruction, but that in order to provide for the security of the country&mdash;without which economic development could not take place&mdash;some form of assistance was needed to help the armed forces do their job. Major reconstruction of the RCAF had to take place; its leadership had to become more professional; and its members had to be better trained&mdash;at a basic level, with elementary military skills, and at a more sophisticated level, in how to wage effective counter-insurgency warfare.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.A great deal depends on the Cambodian people themselves, and in particular on their political leaders, to deliver good government to the country, particularly in the rural areas. I have put those views to the Cambodian Government quite bluntly, and with increasing force and directness in recent months. Its members know that they can only expect continuing international assistance if they do the right thing by their own people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.Nonetheless, in judging the way Cambodia is dealing with its problems today, we have to remember that the government, the bureaucracy and the army are just one year old. There is no judicial system to speak of, though we and others are trying to help rectify this. Most of those with an education were wiped out during the Khmer Rouge period. We cannot begin to imagine here in Australia the dimensions of the obstacles faced: the comparison would be some 2 to 4 million Australians being killed, including nearly all the country's best qualified administrators and professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.There is hope. The coalition has survived, and the two Prime Ministers whose factions were previously literally at each other's throats are working together reasonably well. An attempted coup came nowhere near succeeding. An economic program which the IMF and the World Bank have applauded has now been introduced and is regarded as one of the most liberal and forward-looking in the region. Certainly a greater level of stability than Cambodia now enjoys will be needed if the economy is to realise its potential, but the fundamentals are there. Many of the country's political and administrative leaders are committed and talented people who have given up lucrative jobs overseas&mdash;in countries like Australia, France and the US to which they fled in the early 1970s&mdash;to come and work for a pittance, or for nothing, to rescue their country from its depths of poverty and misery. There are numerous non-government people, among whom are many dedicated Australians, who are working hard to get Cambodia back on its feet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.The population of Cambodia&mdash;now some eight and a half million people&mdash;has suffered beyond measure. We must not give up on people who depend so much on us and others in the international community. Can we really in all conscience even consider reducing the programs Australia has in place to help rid the country of the estimated ten million mines which are still waiting to be activated by innocent farmers and children wandering in the fields? Can we even think of abandoning programs for bringing schools, health care (eradicating polio and controlling malaria in children for example), expert advice, help with rebuilding bridges that have been destroyed, and so on&mdash;programs which amount to $92 million over four years&mdash;because the Khmer Rouge have cold-bloodedly murdered two of our citizens? This would be the glorious victory the Khmer Rouge are looking for; it would hurt the very people whose misery we wept over in the late 1970s when the depths of the Khmer Rouge atrocities were revealed. Now is the time to help Cambodia&mdash;not five years down the track. There is a humanitarian imperative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.We must also resist the temptation to turn our backs on Cambodia for another reason: there are important security interests for Australia and the region at stake. If Cambodia were to return to the battleground it was, there is the grim possibility of other players in the region being slowly but surely sucked into supporting one side or the other. The very real gains brought about by the end of the Cold War, where countries of the region such as China, Vietnam, Thailand and Laos are moving gradually but inexorably towards fruitful economic partnerships, would be undermined. There would be refugee outflows; tensions; regional suspicions would again be aroused; and there would be a loss of confidence in the region about the ability of this part of the world to live peacefully together. Cambodia is not an isolated country which can be ignored, quarantined or put in the too-hard basket. There is a ripple effect from whatever happens there which may not be obvious immediately but which could eventually corrode the sense of regional stability and the prospects for regional prosperity on which Australia depends for its own security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.We should need no reminder of how cheap life is to the Khmer Rouge, and of what they are capable: the between one and two million Cambodians who died at their hands in the 1970s, the numerous Vietnamese and Cambodians who have been killed in the period since, and now the murdering of foreign hostages. Their aim is to drive a wedge between the Cambodian Government and some of its strongest supporters in the rest of the world, and to turn away foreign tourists and potential investors, thereby dampening hopes for an economic upturn in Cambodia which might give the Cambodian people some prospect of a decent livelihood.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.The international community must help Cambodia, and not only by continuing the excellent program of development assistance now in place, one particularly designed to improve living standards in rural areas. It must now help the country to organise the kind of competent, professional and disciplined army that will be capable of containing, and ultimately destroying or completely neutralising, the Khmer Rouge&mdash;of which there are presently estimated to be no more than 8000 men under arms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.There have been discussions between a number of countries about coordinated military assistance, involving in particular training and institutional support (for which there is a much greater immediate need than for lethal materiel). The Defence Minister and I will be taking a joint submission on this subject to Cabinet as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">QUESTION AND ANSWER SESSION AT MEDIA CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA BY SENATOR GARETH EVANS, SYDNEY, 3 NOVEMBER 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:You say the media problem over there was a factor&mdash;did it exacerbate the situation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:It was a problem for the reasons that I have described. The media invaded in force and were desperately keen to get stories and that's perfectly understandable&mdash;that's what the media exists for. But in the process, it was made clear by the nature of the international coverage that was given to the issue, that the Khmer Rouge really did have a prize on their hands; a group of people in which the international community was intensely interested, about which they were intensely concerned. That unquestionably itself served to raise the price, not only in the first instance in terms of the kind of ransoms that were being demanded but also I think, moved the situation from being one of merely a monetary kind of ransom being demanded to a political ransom being demanded: it upped the ante to that extent. There had been a history for a long time of people being captured and ransoms being demanded and negotiations of one kind or another being held, including with the Westerner Melissa Himes just a few months earlier. But all of that took place out of any media spotlight and I think it just has to be frankly acknowledged&mdash;I say this just in the spirit of objective description&mdash;that the media was a factor.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other dimension of it was the sheer level of confusion I think that was generated by multiple channels of communication being opened up with the media offering various inducements for people to give information which was then in dramatically short supply; that in turn leading I think to a lot more crossed wires in terms of reports and conflicting reports and channels of access to the hostages than would otherwise have been the case if it hadn't had that kind of spotlight. I made these points to the media at the National Press Club speech and question time session I made some weeks ago. I don't want to particularly emphasise the matter; that's history now and a story is a story and I suppose you people have just got to chase them. But I did ask at the National Press Club a long time ago for restraint to be exercised. I think there was a little bit of restraint, at least after that, but really the damage had been done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:What confusion are you talking about; which quarters; the Cambodian Government or the Australian Government or. . . ?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well fairly universal confusion. It has been very, very difficult to keep lines of communication running in straight lines throughout this. Part of the problem is the incomplete relationship, if I could put it gently, that the Cambodian civilian government has with the military leadership and the incomplete relationship that the military leadership in Phnom Penh has with its own commanders on the ground. We are talking, remember, about a fledgling government; only one year old, still in the process of getting itself together and we're talking about a situation which is enormously difficult to manage even for governments of vastly greater stability, longevity and experience as we know from other cases around the world. So the business of communication&mdash;who had access to what information and how it was being received and how it was being circulated&mdash;was really one of the big problems running throughout this, and having a whole heap of additional players in the act all wanting lines of communication of their own, preferably exclusively, preferably before anyone else had them, it did lead to a very, very difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Given your much publicised role in the Cambodian peace process, do you now accept this as a personal failure?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I wouldn't put it in personal terms at all, any more than there is any foundation at all for suggesting that my personal or political ego was somehow at stake at any stage of this whole affair. The reason I and the Australian Government got involved in this was essentially for two reasons: a gigantic humanitarian imperative, to try and do something to lift a country that had suffered so much and people that had suffered so much for two decades out of that misery; and a security imperative&mdash;this was one of the great continuing, destabilising conflicts in the region that involved not only internal players but the external ones as well&mdash;China, Vietnam, Russia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:But you had no influence?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well we had a very considerable influence in bringing the original peace plan to fruition and I am describing why it was that I got involved in that. Why it was that I was involved in the hostage crisis is by virtue of my ministerial responsibility and at the end of the day we failed, of course we failed. And that is a matter of tragedy for all of us but it's not a matter that I would want to characterise in personal terms. I think it is really rather tacky for anyone to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Jeff Kennett is saying that the Government made no real attempt to save David Wilson. What would you say to Jeff Kennett?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well I will send him a copy of the statements I have just made this morning and hope that he will be better informed in the future. Obviously we had to be very careful about what we were saying publicly to the media, throughout the whole course of the crisis, because we didn't want to say or do anything that would inflame it. These sorts of situations, if they are ever going to be resolved, essentially do depend for their resolution on quiet, behind-the-scenes negotiation. That failed at the end of the day, for reasons that I think are pretty clear to us all. But there is nothing more the Australian Government could have done and as I think back over the whole of that last three months as I did in preparing this statement over the last 48 hours or so, tracking back through every step along the way, I genuinely don't believe there were any other options available to us at any step along the way than those that we very actively pursued. We had a team of 10 or 12 people effectively engaged full-time&mdash;and by full-time I mean seven days a week in most instances, most of the time&mdash;on the ground in Kampot; on the ground in Phnom Penh; back here in Canberra; in my office. The notion that we were somehow sitting and twiddling our thumbs watching the world go by and somehow callous or indifferent to the fate of an Australian citizen is so far from the truth that it is ludicrous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:What happened to the idea of using Australian troops?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I don't want to talk in detail about that but there were both intelligence reasons (ie a shortage thereof), and security reasons: inability to maintain any secrecy about an operation of that kind. Quite apart from any other consideration, that idea didn't really get to first base for that reason.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Since the murder of Kellie Wilkinson we have heard nothing about her murderers being brought to justice. What moves will the Australian Government be making to ensure the follow up in of General Paet in this case?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well we are very concerned about the Kellie Wilkinson case obviously, that hasn't just passed into history. The difficulty is that the Khmer Rouge commander that is responsible for that killing is and always has been headquartered in a very difficult and inaccessible part of the country&mdash;the foothills of the mountains to the north of the Phnom Penh/Sihanoukville Road. Although they mounted a raid on the road and intercepted the convoy and took them there they disappeared up into the mountains very quickly. The Phnom Vor area by contrast where this recent case occurred was at least surroundable by the military and capable of assault. Whether that was a sensible thing or not&mdash;it was certainly capable of encirclement and the kind of pressure that was maintained. I am just describing why it is that it has not been possible so far for a major campaign to be mounted against the perpetrators of the Wilkinson abduction. That is exactly the kind of thing that in due course we are hoping that a sufficiently competent, disciplined, professional army will be able to do: bit by bit, work its way around the country and do the job of cleaning out those areas that are held by these sorts of people. Under those circumstances the hope of bringing that particular person to justice is not an unreal one in the longer term.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the situation with respect to Paet who was clearly responsible for the murders here, I can't do any more than repeat what I said a little earlier on: the first thing was to make it absolutely clear that there could be no question of an amnesty, whatever virtue in general terms the amnesty strategy might have in encouraging defectors and of course we understand the policy considerations which lie behind that in general terms. But my first concern, and this was one of the reasons I spoke as I did in Ulaan Bataar, was to get very firmly on the record very early that that was not an option so far as we or anyone else in the international community would be concerned, for Paet. Now there is the problem of actually apprehending him and bringing him to justice and that in practical terms is a very real problem. I guess the answer to that, unless there are any further developments soon, will be the same answer I've given in relation to the perpetrators of the Wilkinson murder, it's just going to have to wait until the Khmer Rouge problem itself can be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:But do you think it's acceptable to the Australian public that the General responsible for the kidnapping has been granted an amnesty?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:The abduction?&mdash;Well that's General Rin. I have answered the question about General Rin. What I have said and please listen carefully to what I said because I will say it again. It was a defensible strategy to grant Rin an amnesty if his defection was obtained for the purpose of securing his cooperation in getting Paet and in particular, of course, the hostages out. The kidnapping, the abductions were horrendous enough and people died in the course of them, but as a strategy, and it was a strategy that was pursued at the end, to use Rin for the purpose of extracting the hostages, who were believed at that stage to be alive, the amnesty can be seen I think as defensible in that context. But that depends in turn on it being clear that Rin did in good faith enter into those discussions in the knowledge, belief, that the hostages were still alive and that good faith remains to be established. And what I have said and what I say again is that the attitude of Australia and the international community will clearly depend on what the outcome of that assessment is.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:What's the difference between a goodwill gesture and paying a ransom?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well I will let you work that out.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:The execution of six Western hostages this year in Cambodia, despite the fact the Khmer Rouge still control a lot of the country, does that mean we are going to have a new phase in the reconstruction of the Cambodia which requires the international community to be much tougher. You mentioned military assistance. Should the ASEAN countries in particular increase their pressure on Thailand to close its border with Cambodia?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:As far as the Thai border issue is concerned I think it is very clear that the present Thai Government is giving no encouragement to the continuation of the Khmer Rouge's role and that certainly there is no element that we can discern of central engagement with the Khmer Rouge of a kind that frankly did exist in the past. That is not to say of course that freelance activity by some individual personnel doesn't occur still in that border area We have made it absolutely clear that it was impossible to justify and to the extent that it's within the capacity of the Thai Government to control we hope very much they will do something about it. The ASEAN countries I know have also made their similar position clear on this. I think probably the Thai Government is doing the best it possibly can in very difficult circumstances in that respect.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">But you talk in terms of the general situation; I don't think anyone should be alarmist about the general situation. The truth of the matter is after the Peace Process last year the Khmer Rouge were a pretty diminished force, with estimates of not much more than six, eight, ten thousand at most personnel, at the time of the Peace Plan, ie armed personnel, and with those numbers being reduced in the months thereafter by a steady trickle of defections and the situation was certainly looking&mdash;the latter part of last year, the first part of this year&mdash;extremely containable. There was still a bit of a leopard spots phenomenon with the Khmer Rouge concentrations not only up in the northern and north-western border areas but also in odd pockets of the country including in the Kampot area which we know all too much about. But nonetheless the situation was containable. I think what happened is the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces just got over-confident about their capacity to deal once and for all with the Khmer Rouge problem, mounted this utterly misguided exercise in Anlong Veng </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and Pailin which when it was reversed a few weeks later, a few days later, did constitute a terrible blow in circumstances that I have described, and really the months since have involved a process of sort of recovery from that. Now I think that whatever we feel about the implications of the Phnom Vor exercise in the south so far as the hostages were concerned, there is no doubt that the Cambodian military has got its act together sufficiently to be able to mount an encirclement operation and an effective containment operation which has resulted in defections and in effect the defeat of the Khmer Rouge involving some hundreds of Khmer Rouge who are really either surrendering or defecting to the Government, and that exercise I think is capable of repetition in the future provided that the military does further get its act together and become the kind of force we would like to see it. We have got plenty of democratic justification; it's got plenty of justification under the Paris Peace Accords; but it will need international assistance for that to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Are we talking weeks or months for Australian military assistance?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I have said already, you've heard me, that Robert Ray and I will be taking a submission to Cabinet as soon as possible. Now whether that will be possible next week or it will have to wait for the week after I don't know. What the lead time will be thereafter for any assistance, if so decided upon from us or anyone else, is again not something I want to speculate about at this stage but we will tell you some more as soon as a decision has been made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:What kind of military assistance..?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I've described the nature of military assistance. We're not talking about guns or ammunition; we're not talking about lethal materiel. What we are talking about is training and other forms of institutional support to build a constant, disciplined, professional army which regrettably doesn't satisfy those descriptions at the moment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Have you decided to keep up military assistance because of what's happened in the past few months?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:No, the whole question of military assistance was discussed, you may recall, you probably don't, at the Bangkok ASEAN PMC and Regional Forum and was a subject of some publicity at the time. It was in response, this was in July, to what we all perceived to be a deteriorating situation after the debacle in Pailin in April and ourselves, the United States, France, Indonesia, one or two others, discussed then the possibility of some coordinated approach. Obviously things haven't moved quite as fast as we would have like them. Equally obviously this hostage case has had a bit to do with that but hopefully now some of that will be able to be put back on track.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Given your status as a peace maker in Cambodia, did you ever try personally to meet General Paet?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:No I didn't try personally to meet with General Paet and there is no particular, useful role I think I could have played. I did consider going personally to Cambodia to discuss the issue with Prime Ministers Ranariddh and Hun Sen and my colleague, Prince Sirivudh and the others on the ground but the judgment was really made that to do so would inevitably just give the whole thing a major new injection of international media and related profile and that given that the nature of the strategy was always one best pursued through keeping the temperature off the situation and quiet, back-stage negotiations, it just didn't seem to be helpful. Never at any stage did we doubt the good intentions of the Cambodian Government; there was ample communication with them. As well as endless communications through Ambassadors and representatives on the ground, I personally had, as I said earlier on today, some six direct contact, either face-to-face at the UN and elsewhere plus the exchange of correspondence and messages from me were going backwards and forwards all the time. We calculated the other day there were some fifty high-level contacts, that's at ambassadorial or ministerial level during the three months with the Cambodian Government and hundreds, probably thousands, of lower level contacts over that period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:What have you learnt from this?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:What have we all learnt from this. Hostage situations are very, very difficult to resolve; that there are limitations on what any government can do for one of its citizens when they are caught up in these situations abroad. That is not an experience unique to Australia. It's been well known to be the case in many other situations around the place. We learnt again that the Khmer Rouge are brutal, sadistic, beyond belief; that they will, it appears, stop at nothing in destabilising the country and ultimately destroying it if they are given half a chance. We created the conditions I think with the UN Peace Plan for bringing that situation under control; there has been some deterioration since but the situation is manageable, containable, redressable for it to be contained and redressed though it will need continual strong support from the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Do you think David Wilson's family accept that you did do all you could do?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well I can only speak on the basis of quite a number of conversations now, including very recent ones with his mother Wendy and his father Peter and I think they do understand and accept that we've done everything we possibly can. David's mother, Wendy, has said as much on the public record, other members of the family of course lashed out; I understand that, I'm not critical of what is a cry of pain, a cry of pain from the heart and it's just something we've got to expect to happen and just ride with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Did the Australian Government meet with those who negotiated the release of Melissa Himes?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Oh yes. The NGO concerned and of course the government officials and so on. That was one of the options that was pursued very early on, to look at the possibility of using a non-governmental intermediary to try and resolve the situation. We really did cover the field. We covered the field absolutely; I don't think anyone can suggest anything that could or should have been done that we didn't look at very, very carefully indeed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:(Inaudible)?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I've already said we wouldn't do anything differently. I think in retrospect, I mean I may amend that judgment with further thought in the days ahead but I mean reviewing as we have, you are very, very limited in your options in these situations. I think we did everything we possibly could.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Senator Evans, what do you say to Dr Michael McKinley?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I give Dr McKinley the usual credence which is nil. What has he said this morning?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:That the Government should have paid ransom, secondly that General Sanderson should have been an intermediary. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well I've answered the ransom question. Yes I did see that piece this morning. He said "it's nonsense, the bit about encouraging further exercises of this kind, no further tourists are going to go to Cambodia in the light of this"&mdash;utterly ignoring the fact that as I have already said to you there are some 300 plus&mdash;between 300 and 400 from a rough assessment the other day Australians in the country, and of course there are many other Westerners apart from Australians. So it's a nonsensical proposition and it's not one that would be accepted by any government in the world.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of using General Sanderson. We did use General Sanderson certainly as a sounding board and a source of information intelligence and he made a number of contributions in strategy discussions about how best to advance the situation. We also used, for example, BillKirk. He was on the ground at one stage and he was, people who were following the UN exercise in Cambodia will know, he is an Australian Federal Police officer. He did such an absolutely brilliant job in various parts of the country in creating confidence, including with the Khmer Rouge in handling some very difficult situations, so I think we used every one that was possibly helpful .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Would you warn young Australians going there?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well there is a revised consular warning that has been out since early August which is even stronger in its terms than the one that was in place at the time David Wilson went there. And I think in short the warning has to be this: it's a very dangerous place to be outside Phnom Penh. Maybe you can fly up to Siem Reap to get into the Angkor complex but don't go by road and really if you want to go anywhere else in the country, by road, make sure it's daylight and that there's properly protected circumstances. I mean it pains me to say this because I would like very much in the interest of the tourist economy, and all the rest of it, to say go for your life, to help the Cambodians but obviously in the present circumstances we can't be that confident and it's going to take some little time yet for security to be fully restored.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:You blame the Khmer Rouge. You don't think you have some responsibility?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well if you'd like to tell me how we could have acted otherwise than we did and what kind of responsibility it is that we ought to be prepared to bear I'd certainly consider that but I'm afraid I can't think of any way that we could have done other than we did.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Are you satisfied with Tony Kevin's role in this?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Yes. What makes you suggest otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:As your ambassador there he was the man on the ground, does he have your complete confidence?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Absolutely. I mean people cannot work miracles. He did his best to work miracles but they didn't happen. It was no fault of his or no fault of any other Australian official. They are an absolutely fine and dedicated and committed bunch and I've got nothing but the highest respect and praise for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Was he experienced enough to handle this crisis?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:He was fresh to Cambodia, he had only just arrived on the scene but there were plenty of people there who knew the situation very well on the ground and he is a very, very experienced diplomat, negotiator. There are not many people around the world that have had hands-on experience in handling a crisis like this but there's absolutely no foundation for any suggestion that his performance was anything other than first rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Was it wise to bring him in in the middle of this case given that he had no experience in that situation?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well there were plenty of people around who did have experience including the previous ambassador who physically remained in Phnom Penh as a source of advice and continued assistance with this for the duration of his stay there. So I'm sorry, you're off on a frolic that I can't see any point in pursuing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:At one stage you said that you appealed for assistance with countries that formerly had links with the Khmer Rouge. Were you referring to China and do you have any details of what response came back from the China source?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Well since you ask I was referring both to China and to Thailand and we did again pursue those avenues because we knew that there were people there that did have in the past some authority as well as some lines of communication. But we were persuaded that neither the authority nor the lines of communication really continued and it was not something that could usefully be pursued. But I mention it simply to indicate that every possible avenue that you could think of was pursued and thought about, wrestled with, and followed up on the ground in many cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Do you stick by the policy of not paying ransoms?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:I have nothing more to say on the subject of ransoms. I've said it today and that's it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q:Do you want to make a comment on Peter Wilenski?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GE:Yes I would. I was going to do that at the end of the session.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may not know but Peter Wilenski died this morning after a protracted, prolonged battle with cancer. He was a very close colleague of mine as head of my Department of Foreign Affairs, also Transport and Communications before that and a very close friend for many years.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will put out a more detailed statement later in the day when I have had time to absorb this and reflect more upon it. But let me say this for your benefit now: Peter Wilenski was a remarkable combination of compassion and intellect and vision and effectiveness. He was a very fine public servant; he was a very great Australian and we will all mourn his passing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THE ABDUCTION AND MURDER OF DAVID WILSON</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Abduction</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.David Wilson and his French and British companions were among about two hundred people abducted by the Khmer Rouge following an attack on a train travelling from Phnom Penh to the beach resort of Sihanoukville on 26 July. There had been several previous Khmer Rouge attacks on this route. The consular warning then current for Australian travellers in Cambodia urged caution, particularly with travel by road, and recommended that travellers exercise due care and maintain a very high level of security awareness at all times. It urged travellers to contact the Embassy for specific security information. (A German travelling companion of David Wilson in fact declined to take the train trip because he believed that conditions were too dangerous.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.When reports reached Phnom Penh of the attack, the Australian Embassy immediately began to investigate and on 28 July, a consular official went to Kampot with British and French officials to establish the facts. The Australia, British and French Embassies reached agreement on a common approach to the Cambodian government and sent diplomatic notes urging a prompt response to the abduction. This set the pattern of future close and cooperative relations between the Embassies and of repeated high level approaches to the Cambodian Government to press for information, including details of what plans the Cambodian Government had to obtain the safe release of the hostages, and to register our concerns that no military action be taken to endanger the hostages' safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.Throughout the crisis we have worked in close cooperation with the British and French governments both in Phnom Penh and in Paris and London. Our approach from the start was that the Cambodian Government was responsible for the conduct of negotiations and for the safety and ultimately the safe release of the hostages: no other approach was possible given Cambodia's status as a sovereign nation. We could make representations, offer advice, warn and encourage, but we were never in a position to direct or control operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Contacts with the Hostages and Ransom Demands</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.It was quickly established that the hostages were on Phnom Vor (Vine Mountain), a long time Khmer Rouge stronghold about 20kms to the north-east of Kampot. On 30 July an Australian Embassy officer sent a message to the hostages which received a reply. On 31 July the Foreign Minister Prince Sirivudh received the first letter from David Wilson which included a demand from Paet the KR commander, for a ransom of $50,000 in gold for each hostage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.A trilateral Australian, French and UK team was quickly established in Kampot, which included consular officers and members of the Australian Federal Police and New Scotland Yard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.The Australian Government's policy on the paying of ransoms is well known. To concede any willingness to pay ransoms is simply an invitation to abduct other citizens for the same criminal purpose. The Cambodian government was advised of Australian Government policy on this issue on several occasions. Our position is shared unequivocally by the French and British Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.The initial hope, nonetheless, was that negotiations between the Cambodian Government and General Paet would eventually secure the hostages' release, perhaps on a similar basis to the Melissa Himes case where, after 41 days captivity, Ms Himes was released on the basis of a `goodwill gesture' involving the provision of some building materials, food and medicines and an undertaking by her NGO employer to complete a local village well project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.During August, we were confident of the hostages' well-being as numerous messages were received and food and medicine were passed to them. The difficulties surrounding negotiations were, however, significantly increased by a large and intense media presence (much exceeding that in the Himes case) which served to raise the perceived value of the hostages in the eyes of the Khmer Rouge and tended to undermine channels of communication between official Cambodian government negotiators and Paet. At one stage, the difficulties became so great that the Cambodian government barred the media from Kampot&mdash;and at the same time demanded the withdrawal of the consular team. The three governments made vigorous representations for the return of their representatives to Kampot, which occurred on 5 September.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.The Khmer Rouge leadership soon realised the value of exploiting the hostages for political purposes and demanded that the involved governments cease to provide military assistance to Cambodia. They set a date of 31 August after which they claimed that they would not be responsible for the safety of the hostages. The Australian Government did not accede to (nor did it reply to) these demands: we were not prepared, and no government ever could be, to capitulate to this crude blackmail. We did nonetheless, in order to avoid any further possible provocation, decide to make no further public reference to the provision of military assistance for the duration of the crisis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.When this ploy failed, the Khmer Rouge leadership switched their attention to the Royal Cambodian Government, demanding the repeal of the National Assembly law of 7 July outlawing the Khmer Rouge. The Australian Government was in full agreement with the Cambodian government that it was impossible for the latter to accept such blackmail. It was yet another attempt by the Khmer Rouge to shift the responsibility for their criminal acts on to someone else.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.The Australian Government considered all options for the release of the hostages including the use of Australian forces, and the involvement of an NGO or individual or representative of another country to act as an independent mediator or in some other way to facilitate a solution. For one reason or another these options were unavailable or ruled out, and together with Britain and France we concluded that the only way to resolve the affair was through the efforts of the Cambodian Government and military acting with the close involvement of our respective diplomatic representatives in Phnom Penh and the trilateral consular team in Kampot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Military Activity</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.The Cambodian armed forces began military activity around Phnom Vor in mid-August which consisted mainly of periodic shelling and of drawing the military cordon tighter around the Khmer Rouge-held area. There was never, as portrayed in the press, a big battle at Phnom Vor: there were a series of skirmishes and fairly erratic artillery attacks, which involved a strategy of gradually eroding the amount of territory held by Paet and his group and reducing their access to supplies. This was an understandable strategy, combined as it was with the parallel approach of negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.It needs to be appreciated that the Cambodian Government had dual objectives in this operation: not only to secure the release of the Western hostages, but also to achieve the destruction or neutralisation of the Khmer Rouge presence in the area, which had long constituted both a menace to travellers and an obstacle to the economic development of the region. These were both entirely legitimate objectives, but had the potential to be in tension with each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.On 24 occasions during the crisis, Australian representatives, acutely conscious of the problem of potential military overreach, discussed or received assurances from the Cambodian political and military authorities that no military action would be taken which would endanger the hostages or cut off the option of negotiation. I made six representations at Prime Ministerial and Foreign Ministerial level which covered the military as well as other aspects of the hostage case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.On the assumption that the most likely date of the execution of the hostages was around 28 September, the reports presently available to us suggest that only relatively low levels of military activity were then occurring, although a minor ground offensive by RCAF Special Forces had commenced a week or so earlier with the intention of moving encirclement forward while also improving the effectiveness of the restriction of Khmer Rouge movement and resupply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.The most substantial military action against Paet's stronghold was that commenced on or about 19 October, which culminated in the RCAF fully occupying the territory: this offensive appears to have commenced at least three weeks after the hostages' death. Paet himself, with a group of some ten people, including his family, appears to have escaped the cordon on or about 27 October. Whether he achieved that with or without the assistance of elements of the RCAF remains to be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Loss of Contact and Defection Strategy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.The last letter from the hostages was dated 29 August, and on 2 September a video made by Indochine television became available. As time wore on after loss of contact with the hostages, we became increasingly worried about their health and circumstances. We continued to press the Cambodian authorities to obtain proof of life and continue with negotiations. This took the form of countless meetings with political and military figures both at the central and local levels in which various options were discussed and information requested. The Cambodian government continued to be responsible for the conduct of the crisis, but the representatives of the three governments had an active input.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.By the latter part of September, the Cambodian Government was pursuing a strategy that combined military pressure with persuading members of the Khmer Rouge group with Paet to defect. Our representatives continually urged that the negotiations continue, but it now seems doubtful whether Paet ever had any intention of entering into serious negotiations for the release of the hostages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.The defection strategy succeeded to the extent that many hundreds of Khmer Rouge soldiers and associated civilians (family members etc) eventually left the mountain. The most important defector, on 15 October, was General Choeuk Rin, self-confessedly the person leading the original train assault and responsible for the abduction, who in turn became involved in negotiations for Paet's own defection accompanied by the hostages. Whether Rin's involvement in such negotiations was in good faith (with him genuinely believing at the time that the hostages were alive) and such as to justify his amnesty in the eyes of the international community, remains to be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.The weeks from early September to mid-October, when there was no news of the hostages, were intensely worrying for the family and deeply frustrating for the government teams in Kampot, Phnom Penh and Canberra trying to assist in the resolution of the crisis. We tried all possible avenues, including appealing for assistance to countries which formerly had links with the Khmer Rouge. King Sihanouk was approached by ourselves through the Governor-General and the French, and the good offices of the UN Secretary-General were invoked. But all to no avail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Reports of Death</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.During almost the entire crisis, the trilateral consular team was on the ground in Kampot in very close daily contact with the local officials and military. When defectors and Cambodians released from Paet's camp emerged, they began to debrief them. On 18 October they received a detailed and credible account from a civilian, himself a former prisoner of Paet, stating that he had witnessed events that led him to conclude that the hostages had been killed in early September. The Kampot trilateral team (which included senior and experienced police officers) was inclined to accept the substance of this witness's account, and David Wilson's parents and the French and British families were informed. On 26 October the Kampot team received a briefing from a senior Cambodian officer, General Meak May, based on defector statements, that the hostages had been killed on or about 27 September: this account gave a specific grid reference for the location of the hostages' graves, and generally was even more detailed and credible than the first report. I was informed shortly after officials in Canberra received this report, and on the strength of this combined evidence (taking into account a mass of other surrounding information), and in the knowledge that the family had been informed, I made my statement in Ulaan Bataar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.The confusing and often conflicting reports that followed were highly regrettable and, of course, only increased the agony of the Wilson family. So far as possible these reports were followed up by the Embassy in Phnom Penh and the Kampot team. Tragically, no proof of life emerged, and on the evening of 31 October, after I appealed to Prime Minister Hun Sen for his personal intervention in the case, news emerged that a grave site had been discovered. The bodies were exhumed and identified on 2 November.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Bringing the Perpetrators to Justice</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.I have made the Australian Government stand on this perfectly clear, both publicly and directly to the Cambodian Government. We want the Cambodian authorities to take every step within their power to bring those responsible for the murders to justice. Second Prime Minister Hun Sen replied to me, on 2 November, in reassuring terms on this matter, saying `I share with you the idea that Mr Paet who orchestrated the abduction be found and brought to trial as a murderer'. Whether, in all the circumstances now prevailing in Cambodia, the apprehension of Paet and any others believed responsible is a practical possibility, remains to be seen.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.I have also made clear that we want those responsible for the original abduction brought to justice as well. As indicated above, a particular question arises about the status of General Rin in this respect: if his defection was secured on the basis that he, in good faith, would seek to ensure the defection of Paet himself, with the hostages, then an amnesty might be regarded as an unpalatable but not unreasonable measure, one familiar enough in law enforcement elsewhere. But the attitude of Australia and the international community will be affected by whether that good faith is established.</PARA>

Their continued pursuit of power through terrorist tactics and their policy of kidnapping innocent travellers for ransom, or for attempted political gain, has caused the death of David Wilson and his friends, as it did those of Kellie Wilkinson and hers. The Cambodian people have, for years, suffered at the hands of the Khmer Rouge. It is regrettable that it has taken the recent tragic deaths of young foreign tourists in Cambodia to bring home to many outside Cambodia the brutal lengths to which the Khmer Rouge will go in their attempts to destabilise the country, with no regard for the individual, human rights or the rule of law.</PARA>

It may well be appropriate at that time to go into some further detail about the military situation and the nature of the government's response to it. For the record now, I will add a little more detail to indicate that we are not wholly unaware of the nature of the situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that the Khmer Rouge does not pose a direct military threat to the viability of the whole Cambodian government and system but it does pose a serious security problem. It presently controls less than 10 per cent of Cambodian territory, in our estimate, in which probably only three per cent of the population is located. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Traditional areas of control are mainly in the west and north-west of the country, in the Thai and Lao border areas. However, there are a number of other rather smaller so-called leopard spots across the country which have formed the base areas for small roving bands of Khmer Rouge to carry out guerilla and bandit activities in surrounding areas. One such base was the Vine Mountain area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our current assessment of Khmer Rouge strength is that there are not more than around 6,000 front-line fighting men. Some estimates put it as low as 5,000. With an accompanying group of other personnel, such as porters and so on, the number of people who are usable in a battle situation, albeit not all as soldiers, is something like 10,000. That represents a very considerable drop in KR strength from the situation estimated in 1991 at the time the Paris agreements were signed, when the figure for fighting men was of the order of 25,000-plus, and the situation last year when the figure was around 10,000. I think it would be appropriate to go into more detail about this, but on a later occasion. On that basis, and since I have run out of time, I will leave it at that. </PARA>

<PARA>Senator Chamarette asked Senator Gareth Evans whether he had spoken to Mr Qiao Shi about the Tibetan situation, whether he had complained about it and whether he had drawn to the attention of Mr Qiao Shi the gross violations of human rights in Tibet&mdash;not that Mr Qiao would need to have that drawn to his attention. The Senate should know that Mr Qiao Shi is the former head of the Communist Party secret police security organisation. This is the man who in June 1988 called for `merciless repression' of the Tibetans who showed any sign of opposition to PRC control in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the man who established a secret unit of the Chinese People's Army, an organisation responsible for the many deaths that occurred in March 1989 in the peaceful demonstration in Lhasa. Did Senator Gareth Evans ask questions of this man? He had the opportunity to do so today and he did not. I am not one to suggest that governments should not talk to governments but, as a member of parliament, I was very concerned today. I did not know that Mr Qiao Shi and his delegation were going to be in the President's gallery. I had been invited by the Presiding Officers to attend a particular function but, when I heard that members of the press were to be present, I decided not to go. </PARA>

That is not necessarily a matter for the minister; it is, of course, a matter that I will need to discuss with the Presiding Officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government has encouraged this parliament and the Presiding Officers to fete this man, Qiao Shi. Obviously, people can change their minds. It should have been up to the minister today to ask this man whether he had changed his mind about Tibet&mdash;whether anything is going to happen to resolve the situation in Tibet; to resolve the situation of the Dalai Lama; to overcome the critical violations of human rights that have been exerted on the Tibetan population by the PRC government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly this was not a matter of the highest priority for Senator Evans, our foreign affairs minister. Otherwise, Senator Evans would have raised it and made it perfectly clear to this man, who was responsible for so much suffering in Tibet, that it was a matter of high priority for him and for his government. I felt Senator Evans's response to Senator Chamarette was disappointing indeed and something that should certainly be condemned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say one more word on this subject, although I did respond at question time as best I could. This was my first meeting with Mr Qiao Shi. Time was limited. I had unfortunately, as a result of various meteorological accidents, missed the opportunity to meet him both in Beijing and last night on arrival in Australia, both of which would have been opportunities to establish contact and at least to cover a number of the agenda items which had to be squeezed into a very tight time frame this morning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the particular agenda items which I did spend a great deal of time on this morning, which nobody asked me about today, was the case of James Peng, the Australian citizen, and his treatment by the Chinese court system. In the context of the time available and the amount of attention that was given to that particular human rights/due process issue, it was simply not possible to get into a more extended discussion of human rights more generally, other than for me to say that we wanted to have the opportunity to keep alive the human rights dialogue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly possible for me in these contexts to throw in a one-word or a one-phrase reference and thereafter come out beating my chest and proclaiming that I have raised an issue. I do not regard myself as having raised an issue unless I do so in proper and substantive terms, in such a way as to make clear the nature of the concern and what we think ought to be done about it. It is not a ritualistic or formulaic business, but enough was said for me to make the point that human rights issues remain very much on our agenda. I think for me to get as much in as I did about human rights issues in that particular case, in the context of a discussion which was basically about GATT and APEC and a number of other current economic policy issues and which did take place in the context of&mdash;given the amount of time that is involved in translation and so on&mdash;a very short meeting, I do not think I quite deserve the vituperation that has been hurled upon me. </PARA>

It is not a matter of being reluctant to do so; it is a matter of being effective when one does so. One picks one's moment in order to be effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the other point that ought to be made for the public record is that Mr Qiao Shi is someone whose reputation, whatever it might have been at the time of the Tibet situation, at the time of Tiananmen was that of someone who was unquestionably on the side of the moderates, on the side of those who were very cautious indeed about going down any more of an oppressive path. It is a very complex situation&mdash;the evolution of these human rights issues, values and principles in China. I simply do not think we ought to be too quick to rush to judgment about the contribution that any particular individual might have made in these situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the record in Tibet is a deeply unhappy one so far as the Chinese government as a whole is concerned, I do not leap, without further evidence, to conclusions, either about the personal role of this particular visitor or about his present attitudes.

Mr Lillico was a Liberal senator for Tasmania between 1959 and 1974. He passed away last Tuesday after a long fight with illness. He lived to the ripe old age of 89 and his death marked the end of a remarkable and diverse political career.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Alexander Lillico was born in the small north-west Tasmanian town of Penguin in September 1905. He attended the Devonport primary and high schools and Scotch College in Melbourne before moving to a farming property at Wilmot, south of Devonport. His first move into a political career came in 1934 when he was elected as a councillor to his local council of Kentish. His service as a councillor was to extend over 27 years and included at various times a period of eight years as warden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1943, Mr Lillico entered state parliament by winning the Legislative Council seat of Meander in northern Tasmania. As is not unusual in Tasmanian politics, Alex Lillico was continuing a family tradition of community service. In fact, when he entered the Legislative Council, it was to sit alongside his father, Sir Alex Lillico, who was already a member of the state upper house. They were one of the first father and son combinations in the same house in an Australian parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 16 years in the Tasmanian Legislative Council, Mr Lillico was approached by the Liberal Party to head the Liberal Senate ticket at the next Senate election. He was duly elected and took his seat in July 1959. He was re-elected in 1964 and 1970 and finally retired from political life in 1974. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A strong states' rights advocate, Alex Lillico concentrated mainly on primary industry and trade issues. During 1967 and 1968, he played a significant part in the Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes. He was also an active member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Trade from 1970 to 1974. It was noticeable that during the debate in the early 1970s over the establishment of the New Zealand-Australia free trade agreement, Mr Lillico fought hard to protect the interests of primary producers and processors, especially his fellow Tasmanian pea and bean growers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to associate the Australian Democrats with the condolences being expressed on the death of former Senator Lillico. As a member of a farming family and a proud Tasmanian citizen, Senator Lillico was known as somewhat of a north-west identity. He could hardly have been anything else, having been a member of the Kentish council for 26 or 27 years, depending on the source; mayor of that area for eight years; a member of the Legislative Council, representing the area again; and then a senator for Tasmania with a particular interest in agricultural matters, which are of such importance to that part of the north-west coast of Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lillico observed in his first speech in 1959 that `overall we cannot have enduring prosperity in Australia unless the primary industries are prosperous and expanding'. </PARA>
<PARA>In that regard he recommended orientation towards the markets to our north. But I do not think that at that time he would have recommended the style of market expansion which the government is pursuing these days. At the time, Senator Lillico was not a subscriber to the theories of economic rationalism or the concept of a level playing field, elusive as that may be even these days. He was, I believe rightly, concerned about foreign-controlled food processing plants operating here but with little loyalty to Australian growers. As far back as 1972, he warned that the inclusion of peas and beans in the New Zealand-Australia free trade agreement was `an act of lunacy'. We can only guess what he thought of the Arnott and Campbell soups affair. He would have noticed it happening, but we did not think to consult him. If we had, we may have had a different impression of it. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of these bills is to provide for amendments to a number of acts, and passage of the Trade Marks Bill 1994, to enable Australia to accept the World Trade Organisation Agreement by 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The World Trade Organisation Agreement is the outcome of the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The agreement will provide a stimulus to the world economy, as well as a framework for the continuing conduct of international trade on a non-discriminatory and sustainable economic basis. For the first time trade in agriculture, services and intellectual property have been brought within the framework of GATT disciplines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All GATT parties, including developing countries, stand to gain from the Uruguay Round outcomes, which in turn will boost job creation, investment, and economic reform internationally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Uruguay Round outcomes contain commitments by Australia's major trading partners for substantially improved market access across the key sectors of agriculture, mineral and industrial products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of special interest to Australia are commitments on beef and sheepmeat, dairy, grains including rice, sugar, horticulture, coal, steel, pharmaceuticals, beer, medical equipment and non-ferrous metals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The OECD has estimated that for agricultural and industrial products alone the Uruguay Round outcomes will result in an increase in global economic activity of up to $A418 billion by the year 2002. For Australia, the income gain has been estimated by the OECD at $A2.5 billion per year. Assessments by the Industry Commission suggest that there may be as much as a $5 billion increase in exports and $A3.7 billion increase in Australian gross domestic product. These estimates include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Around $A1 billion in increased agricultural exports per year</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An average cut of more than 50 per cent in tariffs facing Australia's manufactured exports</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Improved conditions of trade for our mineral exports, especially coal to these figures need to be added gains from expanded services exports and increased sales and royalties for Australian know-how.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I will now outline for honourable senators the benefits for Australia in each of the major categories of the Uruguay Round outcomes on agriculture, tariff reductions, intellectual property and services. In doing so I will explain the legislative action necessary to give effect to Australia's commitments in each of these categories, which is in the bills before honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agriculture</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Uruguay Round Australia took on the daunting task of bringing agriculture more fully into the international trading regime. Reform of the global agricultural system was, and still is, a top priority for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an indication of the determination and solidarity of Australia and the cairns group&mdash;which Australia founded and chairs&mdash;that the round negotiations included a comprehensive mandate on agriculture which led to a genuinely trade liberalising outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The negotiations have broken new ground by extending fully the rules and disciplines of the GATT to trade in agriculture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits will flow from reform commitments on a formula basis to world agricultural trade in three major areas: market access, domestic support and export subsidies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of improved market access, the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics (ABARE) has estimated that Australia can expect by the end of the implementation period to export annually an extra $A330 million in beef, $A210 million in dairy products, $A320 million in wheat, $A50 million in coarse grains, $A30 million in rice and $A10 million in sugar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over the next six years there will be a major reduction in the level of trade distorting export subsidies. They are to be cut by 36 per cent in value and by 21 per cent in volume. Domestic support will be cut by 20 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures (the SPS agreement) will also assist Australian exporters in ensuring that such measures are only maintained to the extent necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health, and are scientifically justifiable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither the SPS agreement nor the agreement on technical barriers to trade (the revised standards code) will alter Australia's ability to maintain more stringent measures than provided for in international standards if this is appropriate to our requirements. Australia could however be called upon to demonstrate that any more stringent standards do not unjustifiably restrict trade or discriminate between countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With our Cairns group senators, we will need to work to ensure that the round commitments are implemented fully and promptly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to measures required by Australia on agriculture, amendments are required to the current support arrangements for the dairy industry and to the tariff measures applicable to cheese and tobacco. Amendments are also required to tariffs on a small number of processed agricultural products to conform with the Uruguay Round agricultural tariff reduction formula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SALES TAX (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENT) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the existing sales tax law, particular juice products are taxed at a concessional rate, currently 11 per cent, if they are made with fruit or vegetables grown in Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea, and meet certain conditions. Very broadly, the products which are covered are non-alcoholic drinks, concentrates and cordials for making non-alcoholic drinks, and food flavourings. Non-alcoholic carbonated beverages must consist wholly of juices from fruit or vegetables grown in Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea for the concessional rate to apply. Juice products made from juices of fruits or vegetables grown in other countries, or which have less than 25 per cent by volume of fruit or vegetable juice, are taxed at the general rate, currently 21 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this amendment, the distinction between juice products made from Australian, New Zealand or Papua New Guinean fruit or vegetables and juice products made from fruit or vegetables from other countries will be removed. The concessional rate (11 per cent) will apply to the same range of juice products which fall within the current concession, but without the requirement that the fruit or vegetables used in making them be grown in Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea. The requirements as to the minimum percentage of fruit or vegetable juices in the goods which qualify for the concession will not be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment will come into effect on either 1 January 1995, or the date the World Trade Organisation comes into force for Australia, whichever is the later.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Intellectual property</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian exports with an intellectual property content contribute billions of dollars in revenue to Australia. These include industries that rely on copyright law, such as film-making, music recording, computer software engineering, and the publishing industry, high value manufactures such as telecommunications, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and advanced technology products, and wines, whose distinct geographical indications are used as a marketing tool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agreement on Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (the TRIPS Agreement) will significantly assist the development of our cultural and knowledge industries. It will provide a single multilateral framework of principles, rules and disciplines dealing with a broad range of intellectual property including trade marks, patents, copyright, integrated circuits, geographical indications, plant variety rights and confidential information. It also provides procedures for consultation and dispute settlement, for border controls and criminal procedures for the enforcement and deterrence of piracy and counterfeiting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are three bills before the Senate dealing with Australia's trips obligations: the Copyright (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994, the Patents (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 and the Trade Marks Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">DAIRY PRODUCE (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Dairy Produce Act 1986 by terminating market support payments to the Australian dairy industry for exports beyond 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current dairy market support payments which were introduced in the 1986 dairy plan are classified as an export subsidy under the Uruguay Round agreement. Australia is committed to reduce export subsidies over the period 1995-96 to 2000-01 by 36 per cent in expenditure terms and by 21 per cent in volume from the base period of 1986-90.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the current market support payments are not constructed in a manner which enables the volume of supported exports to be reduced, a revised approach is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government and the dairy industry have agreed to a two stage approach. The first stage comprises the amendments  of this bill to terminate market support payments for the Australian dairy industry for exports beyond 30 June 1995, thereby satisfying Australia's commitments on subsidies by removing the export subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event of the WTO Agreement not coming into force until after 1 July 1995, provision is made for the termination of the market support payment scheme to be delayed until the first day of the next financial year after the financial year when the agreement enters into force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second stage will involve the introduction of legislation in the autumn sittings next year, amending the dairy produce act 1986 to enable the implementation of a new domestic market support mechanism to apply from 1 July 1995 until 30 June 2000. The government has committed to deliver the same level of support as applied under the existing scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Tariff reductions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Uruguay Round achieved the biggest market access tariff reductions package ever in GATT negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall tariffs facing Australia's exports will be cut on average by around 50 per cent on a trade weighted basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More than 86 per cent of Australia's exports will now enjoy predictable market access through bound tariff commitments by most of our major trading partners. The average bound tariff rate facing Australian exports of industrial products will be less than 2 per cent on a trade weighted basis while nearly 50 per cent of Australia's exports will enjoy duty free access to significant markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia will meet virtually all of its commitments within the framework of the government's current program of phased tariff reductions. While more than 95 per cent of Australia's tariffs will be bound, in general these commitments will be at levels above the current applied tariff rates or the rate which will apply when the current program of tariff reductions has been fully implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on Industry Commission analysis, the export gains for industrial products will be about $A3 billion per annum when the majority of the cuts are implemented by 1 January 1999.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">TRADE MARKS BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Commonwealth first legislated in trade marks matters in 1905, there have been three significant reviews. The first two, in 1938 and 1954, resulted in the existing Trade Marks Act 1955. The third, which stems from a desire to streamline the trade marks registration system, is underway right now. This review takes account of Australia's TRIPS obligations. It also reflects the government's commitment to having in place the best possible registered trade marks system for Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Marks Bill 1994 was introduced in the Senate as an exposure draft earlier this year by the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction who sought comments on it until 31 August. Those comments are at present receiving consideration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill now before the Senate is, for all intents and purposes, the same bill as that introduced. It differs only in relation to minor TRIPS-specific details.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key changes required to make the existing trade marks law consistent with the requirements of the TRIPS agreement relate to the definition of a trade mark, and the tests for registrability and infringement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As public comment had already been sought on the Trade Marks Bill at the time of the Marrakesh ministerial conference in April, and as amendment to current legislation and administrative procedures would be complex, it is expedient to proceed with passage of the Trade Marks Bill to enable Australia to accept the WTO agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that the bill does go further than what is required in relation to our TRIPS obligations, the government will be taking account of comments received during the public exposure period and will make any necessary changes. It is proposed to introduce an amending bill early in the Autumn sittings of 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Services</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main outcome for Australia in respect of trade in services was the achievement of clear framework rules which can apply to all service sectors. The other main outcome&mdash;country market access commitments&mdash;will set the world on the course of services trade liberalisation, although there will need to be future rounds of negotiations to match what has been achieved in goods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By removing discrimination and adopting clear rules and disciplines the General Agreement on Trade in Services (the GATS) will assist Australian services exporters overcome trade barriers. It will produce export and investment opportunities in the telecommunications, banking, insurance, professional and business service sectors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A sample of tangible benefits to Australia's services exporters from the GATS includes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">More liberal access to Japan's legal services sector</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Enhanced access to Japan's insurance market (cross-border freight)</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thailand is phasing out preferential access for United States professional service providers over a 10 year period</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Korea has committed to eliminate discrimination in favour of United States insurance providers</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Korea has begun to open its financial sector to foreign competition</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many countries have made commitments on movement of personnel, a key factor in exporting professional and business services. And further work is slated for this area commencing next year</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">All the developed countries, most ASEANs, Korea and Japan have made commitments on value-added telecommunications services (includes data transmission, facsimile, private leased services, on-line information, data processing, etc)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia only undertook commitments that reflect the current situation for those services included in its schedule, and it took out exemptions to cover two minor pre-existing MFN inconsistent measures. States agreed to the commitments listed in the Australian schedule. No legislative changes will be required to implement the GATS undertakings made by Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, beyond the trade deals I have just outlined the Uruguay Round was beneficial for Australia in other ways. The World Trade Organisation agreement provides for improved arrangements for managing the implementation of the Uruguay Round agreements through the establishment of the World Trade Organisation (the WTO).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The WTO will administer all the agreements on goods, services and intellectual property, and will manage operations such as the trade policy review mechanism and the integrated dispute settlement system. The WTO will also provide a forum for maintaining the momentum for freer and more open trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Uruguay Round outcomes also include agreements which will improve the effectiveness and transparency of mechanisms for addressing difficulties which inevitably arise in international trade. For example, the agreements relating to anti-dumping and subsidies and countervailing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Anti-dumping/countervailing</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The arrangements concluded under the Uruguay Round relating to anti-dumping and countervailing (formally titled the agreement on implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures) provide for greater precision and predictability in procedures for the application of anti-dumping and countervailing measures by all countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this respect, however, the WTO agreements will require no fundamental change to Australia's present approach on anti-dumping and countervailing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new WTO agreement on anti-dumping there are more specific requirements on when and how anti-dumping action can be taken, and the methodologies to be used by authorities in the conduct of investigations&mdash;including for determining dumping and injury&mdash;are set out in greater detail.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement introduces disciplines to ensure investigations do not proceed where dumping margins are very small or the alleged dumped imports are only a very small proportion of total imports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to subsidies and countervailing measures, the WTO agreement introduces a definition of a subsidy and also defines categories of subsidies that are prohibited, actionable and non-actionable respectively. This categorisation addresses a number of grey areas, while establishing limits on the extent to which measures can be countervailed. The agreement also contains clearer and more detailed provisions on the procedural and methodological requirements for the application of countervailing duty measures against subsidised, injurious imports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common procedural and methodological aspects of the Anti-dumping agreement and the subsidies and countervailing measures agreement have been largely harmonised. Both agreements provide for enhanced dispute settlement procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's export composition is rapidly changing towards more elaborately transformed manufactures directed increasingly to the newly industrialising economies. These countries are moving towards more open regimes, replacing non-tariff barriers with tariff-only regimes, and at the same time reducing the level of protection provided through tariffs. These countries are looking increasingly at introducing anti-dumping laws. It is in Australia's interest that international rules on dumping be as transparent as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PATENTS (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's patent law, by and large, accords with the minimum standards and principles set by the TRIPS Agreement. However, the Patents (World Trade Organization Amendments) Bill 1994 proposes that the Patents Act be amended in four areas in order that our patents legislation is fully consistent with the TRIPS Agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the term of a standard patent will be increased from 16 years to 20 years. This will apply to every patent whose 16th anniversary falls on or after 1 July next year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change will subsume the special provisions for extending the term of pharmaceutical patents to 20 years. The government nevertheless remains committed to introducing an effective 15 year term for those patents while recognising the legitimate interests of generic drug manufacturers. It is working closely with industry to that end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, in certain infringement proceedings it will be over to the defendant to prove that his or her product was obtained by a process other than the patented process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be where the product is identical with those obtained by the patented process; the court considers infringement very likely; and the patentee has taken reasonable steps to establish, without success the process actually used by the defendant. This will remedy, to a large extent, a difficulty with the present system in successfully bringing infringement proceedings in respect of a process patent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Third, the conditions under which compulsory licences to work a patented invention are granted by a court will be extended to take account of the economic requirements of both the patentee and the person wishing to work the patented invention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And fourth, the conditions under which the Commonwealth or a state can use a patented invention without the authorisation of a patentee will be brought into line with internationally accepted norms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional provisions will help ensure that persons who might find themselves at a sudden commercial disadvantage in the short term because of the increased patent term will have adequate recourse to remedies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends the Customs Tariff Act 1987 to give effect to Australia's tariff binding commitments arising from the Uruguay Round negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the government's domestic economic reform program, there will be only a very limited number of minor adjustments to the tariff reduction program announced in the March 1991 industry statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On light beer and some medical equipment items tariff phasing will continue beyond 1996 levels. On these lines the tariffs will phase to zero by 1999. In both cases, there is industry support for Australia's participation in these sectoral arrangements which will result in most major markets also reducing tariffs to zero.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a few motor vehicle parts, some technical adjustments will be made to bring certain tariff lines into conformity with our GATT obligations. These products, which include clutches and gaskets, air conditioning components, electric motors and electrical components, are part of a larger group of products that were recently restored to the motor vehicle plan. As a consequence the tariffs were temporarily raised to 15 per cent, consistent with the industry rate for this sector.  The tariffs on the 12 lines affected will be phased down to the bound rates negotiated in the round. In all cases the final tariff level will remain at or above rates which have applied in recent years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a small number of agricultural products, some modest additional tariff cuts will also be required beyond the government's tariff reduction program. These adjustments will be necessary in order for Australia to comply with the minimum 15 per cent cut per tariff line on the base rates required by the agriculture agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also introduces the changes necessary to give effect to Australia's Uruguay Round obligations applying to cheese and tobacco.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Differential sales tax on fruit juices</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the fundamental pillars of the GATT is the principle of national treatment, in which each country gives the products of all other countries treatment no less favourable in their market than that given to like domestic products in terms of internal rules, regulations, taxes and other charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The differential in taxes between fruit juice which has 25 per cent or more Australian content and other juices is not consistent with this principle. However, Australia has been able to retain this tax arrangement because of the `grandfather' clause allowing countries joining the GATT to apply the multilateral rules to the fullest extent not inconsistent with their own legislation existing when they joined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the World Trade Organisation involves the removal of the `grandfather' provision and hence the removal of the GATT coverage provided to the Australian local content sales tax arrangement on fruit juice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The requirement to change GATT inconsistent measures maintained under the `grandfather' clause applies to all of the 123 member countries of the GATT-WTO which have unfair and discriminatory trade practices under this provision. As an export dependent country Australia stands to benefit from the removal of discriminatory barriers to trade which other countries may have maintained under the `grandfather' clause.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF (ANTI-DUMPING) (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main effect of this bill is in regard to the level of any duty payable for the period prior to the date of the final decision to impose duties. The current practice of limiting these earlier duties to the level of any security has now been formalised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS LEGISLATION (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the Customs Act 1901 and the Anti-dumping Authority Act 1988 to bring Australia's anti-dumping and countervailing regimes into conformity with the standards and principles arising from the Uruguay Round agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major amendments can be summarised as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to the current arrangements for determining dumping margins based on a comparison of individual exports prices to Australia with individual domestic selling prices (normal values) in the country of export, the Customs Act 1901 will allow for the comparison of a weighted average of the export prices to a weighted average of normal values, as well as an option for comparing individual export prices with a weighted average based normal value. This means that where there are price variations for the same product within a market, a weighted average can be used to assess a representative value;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister will be required to reject an application, or terminate an investigation, where dumping margins or levels of subsidisation are de minimis or there are negligible volumes of dumped or subsidised imports. Quantified thresholds for each of these concepts have been included; </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for an investigation to be initiated must be supported by a major proportion, as defined, of the total Australian industry and there is greater definition of the requirements of an application;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The procedures for duty imposition have a clear emphasis on company specific rates rather than broad country measures, and provision for residual rates to apply for exporters other than those specified is introduced;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The normal time limit of holding dumping securities for four months has been extended to six months (the corresponding provision for countervailing duties remains at four months);</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is comprehensive guidance on identifying forms of subsidies and calculating the levels of subsidisation;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Inclusion of provision for preferential treatment for developing countries in countervailing investigations, essentially via less stringent benchmarks for establishing de minimis subsidy levels and negligible volumes of exports for termination purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COPYRIGHT (WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australia is a member of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works, our law already complies with most of the copyright obligations in the TRIPS Agreement. However, three changes to the Copyright Act 1968 are necessary to comply fully with the TRIPS provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To grant rental rights in relation to computer software and sound recordings;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To extend the scope of performers' protection; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To expand the border enforcement provisions in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To provide a reasonable opportunity for transition for affected businesses, advantage will be taken of the implementation period allowed by the trips agreement and therefore will not enter into effect until later in 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, at the Marrakesh ministerial meeting in April 1994 trade ministers of over 100 countries agreed to give high priority to completing legislative processes according to their respective constitutional requirements so as to be able to agree to the entry into force of the world trade organisation on 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The major trading nations, particularly the United States, Japan and the European community, are working to this goal. Despite the delay in the United States vote, the government remains confident that the majors and a large number of our other trading partners will be in a position to agree to the entry into force of the WTO on 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To receive the benefits of the Uruguay Round agreements from the time our major trading partners start to implement their commitments, it is essential Australia be in a position to accept the World Trade Organisation agreement from the target date of 1 January 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For Australia, acceptance of the WTO means much more than acceptance of the trade deals in individual sectors. It means continuing to be an influential member of a comprehensive and dynamic multilateral agreement which is vital to Australia's trade and economic interests.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The focus of the Youth Training Initiative will be to encourage young people to undertake full-time education or training, entry level training, and appropriate employment opportunities. This will be achieved through an integrated program comprising personalised case management, access to labour market or vocational training program places and the new income support arrangement, the Youth Training Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first strand of the Youth Training Initiative will provide intensive case management to unemployed young people. A young person will have ongoing, one to one contact with a case manager to identify his or her individual needs, help the search for suitable education, training and work opportunities and co-ordinate access to services such as labour market programs. Clients will be eligible for case management 13 weeks after registering as unemployed (with earlier case management assistance for clients assessed as being at high risk of becoming long term unemployed). Case management will be provided by Employment Assistance Australia and contracted case managers from the community and private sectors; this will be regulated by the Employment Services Bill 1994, which is currently before the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second strand of the Youth Training Initiative will provide labour market or vocational training program placements to young people who remain unemployed six months after registering with the Commonwealth Employment Service (with earlier assistance for the high risk group). This will involve a major expansion in the labour market program assistance available to young people. To this end, the Government has substantially expanded entry-level training opportunities and the Youth Training Initiative will provide over 50,000 labour market program places a year when fully implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third strand of the Youth Training Initiative addresses the issue of income support. The Youth Training Allowance will replace the current Job Search Allowance for unemployed young people under the age of 18 years. (However, young people who are receiving Job Search Allowance as at 1 January 1995 will continue to do so.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Youth Training Allowance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that income support arrangements do not provide a disincentive for young people to undertake full-time study or training. To address this issue, the Government has been progressively moving to align student assistance payments and benefits for unemployed people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of the Youth Training Allowance is a further policy development and will align benefits for unemployed young people more closely with assistance available under AUSTUDY. In particular, the Youth Training Allowance will introduce an away from home rate for unemployed young people who do not qualify as independent but who need to live away from home to seek employment or undertake suitable training. Payment of the away from home rate will be subject to certification by the Commonwealth Employment Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the clear emphasis on employment, education and training outcomes sought for the target group of the Youth Training Initiative, the bill will establish the Youth Training Allowance by amending the Student Assistance Act 1973, which will be renamed the Student and Youth Assistance Act&mdash;providing for Youth Training Allowance, AUSTUDY, ABSTUDY and the Assistance for Isolated Children scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The delivery of Youth Training Allowance will, however, be similar to Job Search Allowance. The Department of Social Security will be the payment agency, handling grants, ongoing payment matters and benefits control aspects. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will handle labour market matters, such as labour market assessment and labour market program placements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Benefits under Youth Training Allowance</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An allowance will be available to unemployed young people aged 16 and 17 years. (An allowance will also be available to unemployed 15 year olds who have reached the school leaving age, live away from home and are unsupported.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The allowance will be paid at three rates: independent, away from home; and at home. The latter two rates will be subject to parental income and assets tests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with present Job Search Allowance provisions, a minimum payment will be payable, subject to the personal income test, to clients who are not independent and would otherwise be ineligible because of parental income or assets.(For 1995, this payment will be $62.90 a fortnight.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general eligibility conditions for the Youth Training Allowance will be the same as the present Job Search Allowance for under 18 year olds. The Allowance will be subject to the present waiting period for clients leaving full-time education. There will be an activity test (requiring clients to undertake job search or approved education or training) and clients may be required to enter into case management activity agreements. There will be non-payment periods for administrative breaches, activity test breaches and breaches of the activity agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Training Allowance will generally be paid fortnightly. The fortnightly payments will include, as applicable, Remote Area Allowance and Pharmaceutical Allowance. Where clients undertake formal training as part of a labour market program, their Youth Training Allowance may also include some Formal Training Assistance ancillary benefits, namely the living away from home component and the home base maintenance component.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fortnightly payments will include rent assistance for eligible young people receiving the independent rate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other legislation will be amended to provide that a Youth Training Allowance recipient will also qualify for a Health Care Card and, as applicable, Education Entry Payments and Employment Entry Payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Income and assets tests</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The parental income test will be based on the AUSTUDY parental income test. The personal income test for the Youth Training Allowance will be the same as for the Job Search Allowance personal income test, as it will need to be applied on a fortnightly basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Training Allowance assets test will be the same as for AUSTUDY. This will be generally more generous than for Job Search Allowance, as it will include a 50% discount on farms and other family business assets. Further, the assets test will not apply if the client's parent or spouse receives Job Search Allowance, Newstart Allowance or other specified income support payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will move to amend the bill so that the Youth Training Allowance assets test will not apply where a client's parent or partner receives the new Drought Relief Payment. Further, the assets test will not take account of farms located in an area severely affected by drought; this concession will continue for six months after the drought has broken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Youth homelessness</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises that there is community concern about the approval of young people as independent on the basis of homelessness and notes that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs is presently conducting an inquiry into aspects of youth homelessness. To give an idea of the dimension of the issue of homelessness in relation to the Youth Training Allowance, I would mention that approximately 20% of clients are expected to receive the independent rate on this basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a difficult issue and there is clearly a need for a balanced approach, while ensuring that assistance is available to young people in genuine need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes that a person will qualify as independent if he or she is unsupported and cannot live at the parental home because of extreme family breakdown or other similar exceptional circumstances or because of serious risk to his or her physical or mental well-being.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government recognises the desirability of having one approach to defining homelessness in its income support programs. The criteria adopted for Sickness Allowance and Special Benefits will be amended to reflect the definition adopted for the Youth Training Allowance. The Government is examining the feasibility of adopting this for AUSTUDY also.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would emphasise that all applications based on claims of homelessness are carefully checked and parents are normally contacted during this process, unless there are exceptional circumstances that indicate this would be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Appeals</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a comprehensive review process to clients who disagree with a departmental decision about Youth Training Allowance. A client can seek a reassessment by an Authorised Review Officer, a review by the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and, finally, a review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The adoption of the appeals system is indicative of the close cooperation between the Department of Employment, Education and Training and the Department of Social Security resulting from the introduction of the Youth Training Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also reviewing the appeals system for the student assistance schemes in the light of the introduction of the Youth Training Allowance, to see whether it would be possible to achieve a more integrated approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Information management</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Youth Training Allowance will be subject to the same information management regime as applies under the Social Security Act, providing for powers to compel disclosure of information and controls on the use and release of that information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will extend these controls to the student assistance schemes also, so that the new regime will for the first time impose explicit obligations on officers not to disclose information obtained for the purposes of student assistance schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As with Job Search Allowance and the student assistance schemes, Youth Training Allowance clients may be asked to provide Tax File Numbers in order to receive payments. The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance&mdash;Transitional and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1994 will include the Youth Training Allowance in the ambit of the Data Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Transitional provisions</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of transitional provisions have been included in the bill to deal with the transition from Job Search Allowance to Youth Training Allowance as the source of income support for unemployed young people aged under 18.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a person applies for Job Search Allowance before 1 January 1995 and their payments would start after that date if they were eligible, then the application will be treated as relating to the Youth Training Allowance rather than for Job Search Allowance. Where a person applies for Youth Training Allowance or Job Search Allowance after 1 January 1995 and their payments would start before that date if they were eligible, then the application will be treated as one relating to Job Search Allowance rather than Youth Training Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Young people who are receiving Job Search Allowance as at 1 January 1995 will continue to do so. The qualification conditions for job search allowance will be modified by consequential amendment to the Social Security Act 1991 so that only certain `saved' clients who are under 18 years of age can receive job search allowance. This will continue unless the person ceases to receive Job Search Allowance for a continuous period of at least six weeks (but not including a period during which the person transfers to Sickness Allowance). Any subsequent application by the person must be for youth training allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provision is also made that determinations and instruments applying to a young person's Job Search Allowance will continue to apply if the person later qualifies for Youth Training Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consequential amendments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the links between the Youth Training Allowance and Social Security payments, extensive consequential changes are needed to the Social Security Act 1991. These include avoiding duplication of Youth Training Allowance and social security payments; providing that Youth Training Allowance clients may qualify for Employment and Education Entry Payments; ensuring administrative continuity where a person moves from Youth Training Allowance to Job Search or Newstart Allowance because he or she turns 18; and enabling Youth Training Allowance overpayments to be recovered from Social Security payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned in the Second Reading Speech on the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, the independence criteria for Sickness Allowance and Special Benefit will be modified to align with the proposed approach for Youth Training Allowance. These criteria will be included in a new rate calculator applicable to under 18 year old sickness allowees which will be inserted into the Social Security Act 1991 by the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present bill will also amend the Health Insurance Act 1973 to enable Youth Training Allowance recipients to qualify for Health Care Cards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of amendments will be made to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. The Taxation Office will be authorised to provide information for use in the administration of the Youth Training Allowance; ancillary benefits under the Allowance will be exempt from income tax; and recipients of the Allowance will qualify for the beneficiary rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I mentioned in the Second Reading Speech on the Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill 1994, the Data Matching Program (Assistance and Tax) Act is to be amended to include the Youth Training Allowance in its scope.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">HUMAN RIGHTS (SEXUAL CONDUCT) BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1948, in response to the destruction and brutality of two world wars, the international community drew up a statement of principle on the protection of fundamental human rights. It was the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The principles stated in the Declaration were set down in response to a period of intense global conflict&mdash;as the Declaration itself states, in response to the disregard and contempt for human rights which resulted in acts so barbarous they outraged the conscience of the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Declaration makes clear that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia played an important role in the post-war international diplomacy which led to the creation of the United Nations and the drafting of the declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have remained committed to those fundamental principles. These principles are as central now to our national identity and international reputation as they were when we were able to contribute to their development almost half a century ago.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These basic rights are universal and cannot be limited by national or state boundaries. They are the birthright of every human being and of all Australians. Every level of government in Australia is responsible for ensuring that these rights are protected and promoted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, there is no more fundamental reason for the existence of governments but to respect and enhance the rights of citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia can feel proud of its record on human rights. However we must also recognise that not all Australians have always enjoyed, or today enjoy, a full range of rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We know that for many generations, the nation's treatment of its indigenous population was less than praiseworthy. That Australian women faced very direct forms of discrimination. That those with a disability were judged not on what they can do but rather on a stereotype of what was perceived they could not do.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Few would deny that many Australians still do not enjoy full equality of opportunity, free to live and advance their lives according to their abilities and judged only on merit. While we have much to be proud of, not everyone is treated with respect and fairness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is about basic freedoms. The right of adult Australians to make their own choices about sexual practices within the privacy of their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been a controversial subject matter. In the public debate which has preceded the Parliament's consideration of this bill a variety of arguments have been advanced. It has been claimed that Australia is being dictated to by foreign law making bodies and that our national sovereignty has been diminished. Others assert that the real issue is the rights of state governments and that the Commonwealth should not contemplate such a law. Some allege the law will render inoperative laws dealing with incest or the regulation of the sex industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will address each of these issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First of all, the bill does not represent the outcome of some process of abdication of national sovereignty. On the contrary. The fact that our National Parliament is now debating this bill itself puts lie to that claim.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the basic decisions made at Federation, indeed a reason for Federation, was that the Australian people should speak with one voice internationally. That is why this Parliament was given the power to act in relation to external affairs and why the pursuit of Australia's international interests is an executive function of the national government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Participation by Australia in bilateral and multilateral agreements is a free sovereign choice by this Nation. It is a long process, which involves consultation within Australia and generally prolonged negotiation at the international level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consultation process takes place in accordance with principles agreed between the Commonwealth and the States. It involves consultation at all levels including heads of government, the Standing Committee on Treaties comprising senior Commonwealth and State officials and directly through relevant functional areas. For human rights, the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General plays a consultative role.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was the Liberal/National Government of Malcolm Fraser which accepted the standards set out in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1980. It did so after a long period of discussion with the Australian States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is Article 17 of that Covenant on which this bill is founded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia acceded to the Optional Protocol to the Covenant in 1991. This followed a decade of consultation with the States and Territories, including discussions by Ministers on human rights and later by Attorneys-General. The majority of jurisdictions, including Tasmania, did not object to Australia's becoming a party to the Optional Protocol.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was this Optional Protocol process which highlighted the inconsistency of particular sections of the Criminal Code of Tasmania with the protection from arbitrary interference with privacy detailed in Article 17 of the International Covenant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fully recognises the importance of such consultations, particularly in areas of shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories such as human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But a right to consultation does not mean a right of veto. Nor does it mean that the National Parliament and National Government can walk away from the fact that internationally it is these institutions that represent Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has also been misrepresentation of the impact the ratification of a treaty has on domestic law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that treaties are not directly and automatically incorporated into Australian law. They cannot alone impose obligations on individuals or create rights in domestic law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that the rights prescribed in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights only become part of Australian law through the passage of legislation by an Australian parliament and through the decisions of Australian courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously this bill and this debate is evidence of that very point. Before joining a treaty, consideration is given to whether legislation is necessary; if so, whether existing Federal or State legislation is adequate; and if not, whether the treaty should be implemented by legislation at Commonwealth or State/Territory level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Often no change of law is called for, or the Commonwealth relies on State and Territory laws to carry out the provisions of treaties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The essential point is that Australian law is made by Australian Parliaments and Australian courts, not by the action of entering into a treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This same fundamental point is true of the views of the United Nations Human Rights Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been argued that the ability of Australian citizens to take a complaint to the Human Rights Committee is a transfer of judicial power to a foreign body; similar to when there were appeals to the Privy Council and Australian law was being determined outside this country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such an argument is totally flawed. It is of course the case that up to 1986 when some appeals from the Australian superior courts were permitted to the Privy Council, the law of this country was directly affected by such decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recourse to the Human Rights Committee permitted under the First Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights bears no resemblance to Privy Council appeals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights Committee is not a court. It does not make binding decisions. It has no power of enforcement. Its decisions do not oblige any action from Australia to change our laws or alter our practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Government does believe the views expressed by the Committee have weight and should be regarded seriously, this Committee cannot alter Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By allowing complaints to the Human Rights Committee, Australia affords its citizens an avenue to explore whether our good record on human rights is being maintained. It displays our confidence in our capacity to meet the same standards which Australia contends internationally should be met by all nations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Human rights within Australia is a shared responsibility of all governments and of each of the Parliaments of the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Parliament has enacted legislation to provide civil remedies to those Australians who may experience discrimination on the grounds of sex, race and disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All of this legislation, together with the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act, is based on international treaties to which Australia is a party, that is, the Commonwealth Parliament relying on the external affairs power in the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This same power is the basis for this bill. The bill is an extension of the Commonwealth's human rights regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet it appears that the use of the external affairs power is to those opposite the vehicle for the clash of two so-called principles&mdash;respect for human rights and support for States' rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government believes there can be no such clash as only individuals and not governments enjoy rights. Governments exist to protect rights, not to enjoy them at the expense of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to legislate for external affairs was granted to the Commonwealth Parliament by the Australian Constitution at Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Constitution also provides that if a Commonwealth and State law are inconsistent then the State law is inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency. The High Court was created and empowered by the Constitution to determine such questions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These basic provisions have all been part of the workings of the Australian Federation since its creation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has long recognised the power of the Commonwealth to make laws to give effect to Australia's international obligations. As long ago as 1936, in the decision of the King v Burgess; ex parte Henry, Chief Justice Latham said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth Parliament was given power to legislate to give effect to international obligations binding the Commonwealth or to protect national rights internationally obtained by the Commonwealth whenever legislation was necessary or deemed to be desirable for this purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">[T]he possible subjects of international agreement are infinitely various. It is, in my opinion, impossible to say a priori that any subject is necessarily such that it could never properly be dealt with by an international agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These principles have been further developed by the High Court. It is not something new or extraordinary that has been invented by the Court in recent times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has used the external affairs power to reinforce Australian sovereignty. Some examples are the maritime boundary agreements with France, the Solomon Islands, Papua New Guinea and Indonesia. Most recently we have taken steps to ensure that Australia benefits from the right to a 200 nautical mile exclusive economic zone recognised in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. There were no complaints about treaties eroding our sovereignty or over-riding the States in these cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The human rights legislation I referred to earlier, the Sex Discrimination Act, the Race Discrimination Act, and the Disability Discrimination Act, all have the same potential impact on State laws as this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A State criminal law which is inconsistent with any of this legislation will by operation of section 109 of the Constitution be rendered ineffective to the extent of the inconsistency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The implication of the views now expressed by many in the Opposition is that Commonwealth laws should be read down so that State laws are not affected. This is to return to the notion rejected by the High Court in the landmark Amalgamated Society of Engineers v Adelaide Steamship Company Limited case of 1920.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the State of Tasmania section 122 paragraphs (a) and (c) of the Criminal Code mean that the private sexual activity of consenting adults, whether heterosexual or homosexual, can be a criminal offence. Section 123 of the Code goes on to make all other `indecent practices' between men a criminal offence. The effect of these two sections together is that adult homosexual men in Tasmania are committing an offence if they participate in virtually any sort of sexual conduct together in the privacy of their own homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Tasmanian laws apply to acts in private as well as in public. They draw no distinction between conduct involving children and conduct involving only adults. Consent of the parties is irrelevant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In December 1991 the United Nations Human Rights Committee was asked by an individual Tasmanian citizen to examine these provisions and to provide a view on whether they were consistent with Article 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The Committee is the body established under the Covenant to administer the Covenant and monitor compliance with its provisions. The Committee formed the view that sections 122(a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code are an arbitrary interference with privacy and placed Australia in breach of Article 17 of the Covenant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, in his report on the Tasmanian provisions, also found that they placed Australia in breach of its international obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Burdekin rejected the Tasmanian Government's arguments that the laws were a reasonable and proportionate response to a perceived threat to moral standards. He said the fact the laws are not enforced clearly suggests they are not necessary for the protection of moral standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He noted that no other jurisdiction has comparable laws and that discrimination on the grounds of homosexuality is unlawful in three out of the six States as well as both Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He also found they were not a reasonable or proportionate response to HIV/AIDS, particularly when the Tasmanian Government itself has endorsed the national HIV/AIDS strategy which calls for such laws to be repealed because they deter people from seeking medical advice and assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Human Rights Commissioner put it:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The moral fabric of Tasmania is not more fragile than in other parts of Australia, nor does it require greater levels of protection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laws like these Tasmanian provisions are simply no longer acceptable to modern Australian society. Similar provisions have been repealed in all other Australian jurisdictions. Such laws are oppressive. They are unjust. They do not meet the standards accepted by most Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the face of such a clear cut case, the present Tasmanian Government has refused to reconsider these provisions. It has, therefore, become necessary for the Commonwealth to act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill translates one important element of our obligations under an international agreement into binding domestic Australian law. Paragraph one of Article 17 of the International Covenant of Civil and Political Rights states that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one shall be subjected to arbitrary or unlawful interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to unlawful attacks on his honour and reputation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most Australians probably take for granted that they live in a society in which they are free to pursue their private lives and, in particular, their private sexual lives, free of unjustified government intrusion. That is the right enshrined in Article 17&mdash;the right to be free from unjustified and unnecessary government interference in your everyday private life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides that sexual conduct involving only consenting adults acting in private is not to be subject, by or under any law of the Commonwealth, a State or a Territory, to any arbitrary interference with privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This guarantee is to operate throughout Australia, including in the external Territories. The bill offers protection to all Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Article 17 of the International Covenant does not provide that the right to be free from interference with privacy is absolute or unlimited. The Article explicitly recognises that in some circumstances it is legitimate to intrude into the privacy of individuals. The Article provides that no one will be subjected to any `arbitrary interference' with privacy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The key word in this test is `arbitrary'. The term `arbitrary' guarantees that where laws do intrude on people's privacy the laws must be justified, necessary and reasonable in the circumstances. In order to meet this test a law must have a legitimate purpose and be a proportional means to achieve that purpose. All such laws must pay due regard to the rights and dignity of the individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Human Rights (Sexual Conduct) Bill recognises and incorporates these limits. The bill deals only with sexual conduct in private between consenting adults. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is appropriate and fully justifiable to have laws which regulate sexual conduct in public, sexual conduct involving children and sexual conduct to which a person does not consent. Expressly, the bill does not affect these laws. Such laws exist throughout Australia and are acceptable because they rest on an appropriate balance between the right to privacy in one's sexual conduct and the interests of the community at large. Indeed, such laws exist in Tasmania quite apart from sections 122 and 123 of the Criminal Code and deal in a much more balanced and appropriate way with sexual conduct which impacts unacceptably on the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The age of consent for sexual activity varies across the States and Territories and also varies depending on whether heterosexual or male homosexual activity is involved. The Government recognises that there is not a consensus across Australia on the question of an appropriate age of consent. The bill does not prevent States and Territories from setting the age of consent below eighteen years of age. The bill deals with sexual conduct involving those of or above the age of eighteen. It is generally recognised across Australia that by the age of eighteen people are expected to be mature enough to make a range of decisions for themselves and to take responsibility for themselves and their actions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Laws which seek to regulate the private consensual sexual conduct of those over eighteen will not be affected unless they are an arbitrary interference with privacy within the meaning of Article 17.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a broad range of laws across Australia which deal with the private sexual conduct of adults. All jurisdictions, for example, make incest a criminal offence. There is clearly a consensus throughout Australia that such laws are justified on medical and other grounds even where they cover conduct between consenting adults. Such laws seek to prevent children being conceived by parents whose genetic makeup is harmfully close. The laws also recognise and protect the special nature of the relationship between grandparents, parents children and siblings, for example. The laws are limited in their scope, relating only to very close relationships. They are reasonable and proportional. They draw an appropriate balance between the needs of the community and the rights of the individual. Such laws will not be affected by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sex industry is also regulated across Australia. States and Territories have sought to deal with the commercial, community and health issues involved with the industry in a variety of ways. Appropriate regulation of the sex industry is not, however, an arbitrary interference with privacy. It is a necessary, justified and reasonable regulation of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some laws, however, cannot, by any stretch of the imagination, be described as justified, reasonable and proportionate. Sections 122 (a) and (c) and 123 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code fall into this category and in doing so have placed us in breach of our international obligations and jeopardised our high standing in matters of human rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is not a servile capitulation to the views of some international body. It is a statement of this Government's belief in and support for the standards enshrined in the International Covenant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is not an invasion of the sovereign rights of State Governments. State Governments, like governments everywhere, have a duty to protect the rights of the individuals within their jurisdiction in conformity with recognised international standards. Where State Governments fail in this duty the Commonwealth's obligation to act is clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that this bill is a significant step in guaranteeing the protection of the freedom from intrusion by government in the most intimate details of one's personal private life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum for this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill amends various acts relating to the meat and livestock industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 to provide for the selling agent to be responsible for collecting and forwarding levies imposed under the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990 whenever that agent is involved in a leviable transaction. The bill also amends the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 to introduce a conversion factor allowing the beef production levy to be calculated where a hot carcase weight is unavailable and only cold carcase weight is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Beef Production Levy Act 1990 imposes a levy on the slaughter of cattle on a cents per kilogram basis of the hot carcase weight. The hot carcase weight is the weight of a carcase that is weighed within two hours of slaughter. At present the act provides that if a hot carcase weight is not available the carcase weight is deemed to be 240 kilograms per head of cattle for levy calculation purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was brought to the attention of the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council that some small domestic abattoirs are not able to determine the hot carcase weight, but are able to determine a cold carcase weight. Representations from these abattoirs indicated that the great majority of the carcases produced by them are under 240 kilograms, and these abattoirs were therefore paying higher levies than they should reasonably have paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, to address this problem, the government has accepted the Australian Meat and Livestock Industry Policy Council's recommendations that a conversion factor be incorporated into the act to allow a conversion from cold carcase weight to a hot carcase weight equivalent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 currently provides that where an abattoir slaughters cattle on which a cattle transaction levy is imposed, the abattoir proprietor is responsible for collecting the levy and forwarding it to the Commonwealth. In other cases, an agent, if involved in the sale of cattle, is responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has caused some problems where an agent is involved in the sale of cattle to an abattoir proprietor or facilitates the sale of cattle on an "over-the-hooks" basis. The proposed amendment clarifies that the agent rather than the abattoir proprietor will be responsible for collecting and forwarding to the Commonwealth the levy imposed by the Cattle Transaction Levy Act 1990. The abattoir proprietor will only become responsible for collecting and forwarding the levy where an agent is not involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Penalties have been imposed in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 for offences relating to amendments in the Beef Production Levy Act 1990 when either the hot carcase weight or the cold carcase weight is available but not used.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment also corrects an omission in the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 regarding abattoir proprietors' ability to refuse to slaughter live-stock. This provision permits abattoir proprietors to refuse to slaughter live-stock owned by another person unless funds for the payment of the live-stock slaughter levy are first made available. The correction brings pigs within the scope of this provision, so that if pigs are to be slaughtered funds for the payment of the pig levy are first to be made available.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EVIDENCE BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a modern and comprehensive law of evidence to apply in federal courts and, with the agreement of the Australian Capital Territory Government, in the courts of the ACT.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comprehensive evidence law reform is not easy. Many challenges have accumulated over too many years for that to be the case. But this Government is taking evidence law reform out of the too hard basket and making it an important feature of the law reform agenda.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill has 3 main objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is, for the first time, to provide an evidence law to apply in proceedings in federal courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, by operation of section 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903, the evidence laws of the State or Territory in which a federal court is sitting apply in that court, in addition to the common law, which is applied under section 80 of the Judiciary Act. There are significant differences between the various State and Territory statutes dealing with evidence. Thus, the preparation by a practitioner of a case before the Federal Court of Australia may differ depending on where the hearing will take place and, if evidence is limited, its outcome may depend on where the hearing is held.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indeed, where the hearing of a proceeding in a federal court is adjourned for further hearing in another State, the evidence law which applies in the proceeding changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major aim of the bill is a modern law of evidence for our nation. Reform of the legal system is essential to ensure that it meets the needs of contemporary Australia. Reform of the law of evidence is an essential component of reforming the legal system. The current law of evidence is a significant cause of cost and delay in many proceedings. Also, where relevant evidence is excluded because of an overly technical or inappropriate rule of evidence injustice may result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the state of present evidence laws, and the need for their reform, the Law Reform Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The present law is the product of unsystematic statutory and judicial development. It is a highly complex body of law which is arcane even to most legal practitioners. It contains traps and pitfalls which are likely to leave the unrepresented litigant baffled, frustrated and defeated. There are also many areas of uncertainty in the law of evidence&mdash;areas on which definitive law is yet to be pronounced by the courts. The need for reform is also demonstrated by what happens in practice: the complexities are ignored, oversimplified versions of the law are applied and judges try to discourage use of its technicalities".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evidence law reform is micro-economic reform. A reformed evidence law will simplify and shorten proceedings. It will reduce costs to governments in providing court services, and to litigants. Reform is necessary to assist the courts to achieve just and proper decisions with a minimum of expense to all concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, and perhaps most importantly, this bill and a similar bill that has been foreshadowed in New South Wales will, it is hoped, form the basis of substantially uniform evidence law throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits of uniformity for the legal profession and for efficiency in the conduct of proceedings are obvious. Probably the greatest benefit would be for business. Business could achieve substantial savings through lower legal costs and record keeping costs if uniformity is achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of this bill in seeking to achieve uniformity is best seen by considering its origins.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impetus for reform, which has led to this bill, came from this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs issued a report in November 1977 in which it recommended that "a review of the whole of evidence law should be undertaken by the Law Reform Commission with a view to producing a wholly comprehensive code of evidence based on concepts appropriate to the present day".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then Attorney-General, Senator the Honourable Peter Durack QC, gave a reference to the Australian Law Reform Commission in July 1979.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Law Reform Commission released 16 research papers on various evidence law topics, an Interim Report with draft legislation in 1985 and its Final Report, also with draft legislation, in 1987.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1988 the New South Wales Law Reform Commission issued a report recommending that, with minor modifications, the bulk of the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations be adopted in proceedings before New South Wales courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1991 New South Wales and the Commonwealth each introduced Evidence bills. Both bills were largely based on the Law Reform Commission's draft bill but both differed in several respects from that draft bill, and from each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In October 1991 the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General gave in-principle support to substantially uniform evidence laws, based on the NSW and Commonwealth bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and New South Wales then worked together to develop a uniform law, taking into account the comments that had been received on the 2 bills. This work was carried out in consultation with the ACT Government, which gave its support to uniformity by agreeing that the Commonwealth bill should also apply in ACT courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In August 1993 New South Wales released a working draft as an exposure bill, for the purpose of obtaining further comments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Evidence Bill 1993, which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 15 December 1993, evolved from that working draft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 10 February 1994 the provisions of the Evidence Bill 1993 were referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee tabled an Interim Report on 7 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's response to the Standing Committee's Interim Report was tabled on 13 October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, following amendments made to the Evidence Bill 1993 in the other place, reflects the Government's consideration, in consultation with the New South Wales Government, of the Interim Report of the Standing Committee, and testimony and submissions to that Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth wants this bipartisan approach to achieving uniformity to be taken up by other States and Territories. The Commonwealth, for its part, will continue negotiations on uniform evidence laws with State and Territory governments through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. Commonwealth, State and Territory governments now have an opportunity to improve the law, to remove inconsistencies and as a result, make the law more just, reasonable and comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to some of the most important features of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like the 1991 bill, this bill is based largely on the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. It also replaces the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901 and most of the Evidence Act 1905.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will apply in federal courts&mdash;the High Court, the Federal Court, the Industrial Relations Court and the Family Court&mdash;and in ACT courts. However, the bill provides a capacity for a proclamation to be made to terminate the application of most of its provisions in ACT courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of the bill replacing the Evidence Act 1905 or the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901 will apply to proceedings in all Australian courts and tribunals, or to proceedings in courts exercising federal jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two dominant themes in the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is to remove unnecessary restrictions on relevant evidence being put before courts. The second is bringing evidence law up to date with technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the bill removes unnecessary restrictions on relevant evidence being put before courts. It is artificial, and in many instances absurd, to limit the material a fact-finding tribunal can accept as evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill reforms the existing rules relating to admission of hearsay evidence. A hearsay statement of a person who witnessed the relevant event (`first hand' hearsay) is to be admissible in civil proceedings and for the defence in criminal proceedings, subject to safeguards such as the giving of notice to other parties and to the calling of the person who made it if he or she is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only specific categories of `first hand' hearsay evidence are to be generally admissible, subject also to the same safeguards, against the defence in criminal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More remote hearsay is to be admissible if it falls within one of a number of categories which are inherently reliable for some reason (for example, because it is a business record).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, bringing evidence law up to date with record keeping technology will mean potential savings to Government, business and individuals of millions of dollars annually, if substantially uniform national evidence laws are implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present the rules for admission of documentary evidence vary from State to State. The original document rule, under which, generally, the contents of a document must be proved by production of the original, applies in all States, but with significant exceptions which differ from State to State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, Governments and businesses operating throughout Australia find it prudent to maintain records in forms that would be admissible in all States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means the retention of the most primitive form of record-keeping&mdash;original paper records, instead of modern methods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth will get the immediate benefit of reform because the bill's documentary evidence reforms will apply to use of its records as evidence in all Australian courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similar benefits for business will depend upon the States and Territories adopting similar reforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removing the need to retain original documents will result in very significant savings in storage costs. No detailed costing has been made of the likely overall costs savings for the Commonwealth. However, the savings available from individual items indicate that they are likely, across the board, to run into millions of dollars. Savings for business across Australia would, of course, be much greater.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides a number of ways in which the contents of documents can be proved including photocopies, facsimile copies, microfilm output or optical laser reader output. Computer output will also be admissible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Safeguards are provided in relation to the testing of documents and of the means by which documents have been produced or kept.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Uniformity will also result in savings as lawyers will only need to learn one law of evidence&mdash;which can be used regardless of the court or part of Australia in which they are practising. They will not have to understand different rules applying in different States and Territories. They will not need additional education or research and significantly their clients will not have to meet the cost of this in their bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing common law, and State and Territory laws, will have effect subject to inconsistency with the bill. However, because the bill contains detailed provisions, the scope for operation of these laws will be extremely limited. Special evidentiary provisions in other Commonwealth laws and ACT laws are preserved by the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Evidence bill paves the way for significant reforms to the application of evidence law in federal courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will permit significant savings in Commonwealth storage costs by enabling departments and statutory authorities to abandon storage of original documents, after their microfilming or transfer to other modern storage media.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I table the explanatory memorandum for the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EVIDENCE (TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill is consequential upon the Evidence Bill 1994. It sets out transitional arrangements for that bill, repeals the State and Territorial Laws and Records Recognition Act 1901 and most of the Evidence Act 1905 and amends several Acts consequent upon the Evidence Bill 1994, or upon the repeals of most of the Evidence Act 1905.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 91st conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union, held in Paris, and the delegation's bilateral visit to Turkey which took place during March and April 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During March and April 1994 a delegation of members of both chambers of the Australian parliament visited Paris to attend the 91st IPU conference and Turkey at the invitation of the Grand National Assembly of Turkey. That, of course, followed the very successful 90th IPU conference that was held here in Canberra in the preceding September. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say right at the outset that many members of the some 120 countries that attended the IPU conference in Paris approached me and other members of the delegation expressing their appreciation for the way in which the conference was conducted here in Canberra. It is a conference that will live on in many of those delegates' memories for quite some time because when I visited Copenhagen for the 92nd conference just a few weeks ago I received the same expressions of interest and thoughtfulness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 91st interparliamentary conference occurred at a time when the Interparliamentary Union wished, for obvious reasons, to focus particular attention on the issue of peacekeeping in the United Nations. It was at the time when events in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia and the refugee problem were high on the agenda of world affairs. As a result, motions were put forward to the meeting along the lines of prevention of conflicts, maintenance and consolidation of peace, and the role and means of the United Nations and regional organisations. Also, concern was expressed about waste management for a healthy environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation was led very ably by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Stephen Martin. I had the honour of being the deputy leader of the delegation. Also in attendance were the Hon. Leo McLeay, a former Speaker of the House of Representatives; Senator Margaret Reid, representing the Liberal Party in Canberra; and Senator John Coates, Liberal senator for Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opening day in Paris was very eventful and we had many fine speakers: Mr Fosset, who those of you who were involved in the IPU would know is the President of the French Group of the Interparliamentary Union; and Sir Michael Marshall, who was the president of the IPU. We were very fortunate to be addressed by the President of the French Senate and also the President of the French Republic, Francois Mitterrand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">President Mitterrand made the point that Paris was welcoming the IPU conference to Paris for the fifth time, it being the 91st conference. He also reminded us that it was the oldest international political institution. Some of his words were very apt for the occasion. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your work is founded upon lofty principles . . . There are many of you, but not yet enough. Democracies are powerful, but they are not powerful enough to prevent breaches of the legally constituted order. Legality must be established where it does not exist, and it must be developed and protected. Similarly, it is vital to safeguard parliaments everywhere and at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sir Michael Marshall also reminded us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Future humanity will be formed from the bringing together and not the suppression of nations still now divided.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the very important role that I perceived at my second attendance as one of the permanent members of the IPU; in fact, it does present an opportunity for politicians from all around the world&mdash;there were 122 countries represented at that conference&mdash;to get together in a peaceful situation to discuss matters of great importance to the whole world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of that conference, there were, of course, many other meetings and friendships made. Australia put forward a submission to a very important supplementary proposal regarding the Uruguay Round commitments, or the implementation of them, which is of great concern not just to Australia but to any producing nation in the world. But we were not successful in Paris at getting that supplementary item debated. We lost our vote and the very important supplementary item called `The importance of adhering to the obligations specified in the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons', which was put forward by the group from Canada, was successful. However, Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be pleased to know that at the recent conference in Copenhagen the Australian delegation was successful in resubmitting that supplementary proposal. It was debated in Copenhagen and will be the subject of a report later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, a lot of other activities went on in that very short week. I remember very well the role that Senator Margaret Reid played as our representative at the meeting of women parliamentarians. I think one of the subjects they covered was a plan of action to correct present imbalances in political participation by men and women in political lives. I do not know whether it had anything to do with the decision that was made by the Labor Party recently, but it certainly received a lot of discussion in Paris. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the 154th session of the Interparliamentary Council, on which the Hon. Leo McLeay and I are the permanent representatives from Australia, things such as membership of different countries were discussed. Burundi, the central African republic, and Comoros, the former Yugoslav republic of Macedonia, were readmitted and Nigeria was suspended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as that, the Hon. Clyde Holding still represents us in a permanent position on the Committee on the Human Rights of Parliamentarians. That in itself has a terrific task to carry out in investigating allegations of abuse of human rights on parliamentarians. I was amazed to see the plight of parliamentarians all around the world who were in gaol or had been disenfranchised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a meeting of International Parliamentary Friends of Burma, and Senator Reid highlighted the issues that were raised at the inaugural meeting here in Canberra. I must say that there was very strong and ongoing support for Aung San Suu Kyi and her other elected parliamentary colleagues who are still in detention in Burma. During the conference, as well as strengthening our ties with the Asia Pacific group and the 12+ group, some members of the delegation made time to journey to the Adelaide Cemetery at Villers-Bretonneux, from which the unknown soldier was brought to Canberra recently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very successful conference, even though our supplementary item was not successful. Apart from that, I believe Australia did the best it could under the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the conclusion of the conference, the delegation undertook a brief visit to Turkey at the invitation of the government of Turkey. As part of that particular delegation, we were fortunate enough to travel to Canakkale and visit the war memorial and also to see for ourselves where the Anzac spirit was first formed. I know my colleague Senator Short not long after that experienced the same piece of history when he visited Turkey on a private visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit to Turkey confirmed for the delegation the special ties that we have with the people of Turkey, those ties that were born during the First World War when Turkey and Australia were enemies. The first thing that impressed me when we visited Anzac Cove was how small it was. It was nothing like I expected even though I had seen many photos of it. Obviously Shrapnel Valley, during that horrific period when the Anzacs were trying to gain a foothold and to move inland, was a very desolate area. When we were there it had been totally revegetated with pine trees. As we commented in our report, we were very saddened to hear on our return that bushfires had wiped out that excellent regeneration of the whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expressions have been made both to Senator Short and to me from friends we have in Turkey on just how widespread the desecration was from that bushfire. In fact, the lone pine at the Lone Pine War Memorial was quite a reasonable tree but it was destroyed during these bushfires. Apart from that, I am pleased to report from indications I have received that the war memorials at various cemeteries remain relatively free of damage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the strength and warmth of the bilateral relationship still exist. In our visits to Canakkale and Antalya, in particular, the hospitality we received and the friendship we were shown were certainly things that I will remember for a long time. We were also reminded that we have a very sound trade and commercial relationship with Turkey. Turkey is our 38th largest trading partner and our 32nd largest export market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During our visit there I was very pleased to meet representatives of the Turkish government who conduct business on behalf of the Australian government. I am pleased to say that I had discussions with one of those members of the parliament who, in his private capacity, is a fish farmer. He had heard about Tasmania's reputation as a place that is growing a lot of fish, and other things. Since then I have passed on information he sent me to friends in Tasmania in aquaculture, and there is a Turkish interest, anyway, in perhaps joint venturing with Tasmanian interests; at the very least, there is a lot of Turkish interest in particular winches that are made for fishing boats in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We took the opportunity when we were there not only to cement the bilateral relationship with our Turkish friends but also to try to sell a few Australian products, which I am sure would please the minister at the table. Having been on a delegation with us once before, he knows that we do try our best in those relaxed atmospheres to do what we can for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, I remind the Senate that when we were at Gallipoli we were reminded of the horrific casualties that were incurred by the Australians and New Zealanders during that campaign. In lots of ways, I think most Australians would recognise that that is where Australia came of age, but at a great price. Some 60,000 Australians died during that conflict. I will always remember that as we drove down towards Cape Helles we were shown a very small orchard known as the `vineyard' where 1,000 Australian troops were massacred in less than 20 minutes. It is a very peaceful place now but at that time it must have been horrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were very lucky to have with us Professor Kenan Celik, who is an historian of some note in Turkey. He gave us many insights into not just the history of the Turkish army but more particularly the history of some of the battles that were played out there and his view on whether, in fact, General Birdwood landed at the right beach or not. Senator Coates, who has just come into the chamber, will remember not only his good knowledge of the Anzac battles, as well as his knowledge of the Turkish side of it and the role Turkey's mine layers played in making the British forces change their mind, but also his great knowledge of ancient history which was of much benefit to us when we visited Troy and a few other places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a memorable delegation. Some very good friendships were made from both sides. From my own personal point of view it is one of the more pleasant delegations I have ever been with. We were very pleased to get back here to our families, of course, but I hope one day to return to Turkey, because it is a place that interests me. Those members of the Senate who were on that delegation do appreciate the warmth that was shown to us, particularly by His Excellency Mr Cindoruk, the President of the Turkish National Assembly, who took time out to speak with us. When we remember that there were very important local government elections being held at that time, it certainly was a special time for us and we appreciate the help that was given not only by him but by all those other people who made our visit so memorable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is acceptable. The opposition's and Greens' amendments deal with much the same issue. Amendment No. 4 deals with section 191D(1). It relates to the grant of interests in land not only to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations, but also to Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders or trustees of Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts. This expands the ability to make grants not just to corporations but to individuals as well, and also to the various trusts that we find from state to state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This principle is most important. It came up during the native title debate, when there was a great deal of debate on whether native title should be able to be afforded just to corporations or to individuals as well. During the course of the hearing by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, evidence was given that there were sectors of the Aboriginal community which definitely were in favour of the ability for individuals&mdash;and by that I include groups&mdash;to be granted land as  well. There is an ongoing debate about whether individuals or groups can be included rather than just corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to my home state of Western Australia, for instance, there are a lot of groups which are quite small&mdash;made up of family members&mdash;and which are not necessarily incorporated. The legislation might well force groups which do not want to be become incorporated to do so. I fully respect their wishes to remain as individuals. Forcing some false corporate entity on them is not within the spirit of this legislation. Therefore, there is great merit in including grants to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, opposition amendment No. 8 deals with the priority that the Indigenous Land Corporation must give to making a grant within a reasonable time after the acquisition. That is merely a flow-on from the principle I have just enunciated, that individuals be granted the land within a reasonable time of the acquisition being made. Amendment No. 15, too, is simply consequential on including individuals and groups. That is where the Indigenous Land Corporation, or its subsidiary as the case requires, considers that it no longer needs to hold the interest for the purpose of making a grant of interest to corporations, individuals or the trusts that I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment 16 again deals with acquiring land for the purpose of making grants to individuals and trusts as well. Amendment 21 is also consequential. It deals with the acquisition of interests in land in the regional area for the purpose of making grants to the individuals and the trusts that I have mentioned. The remaining amendments are consequential, but I will touch on them for the record because they deal with discrete areas and should be mentioned. Amendment No. 28 deals with section 191T and is designed to omit the words `body corporate'. This provision currently limits the land holding to a corporation only. Amendment No. 29 is tied in with this and again deals with the words `body corporate' and substitutes the word `person'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are advised by the clerk that in this context the word `person' can include both a corporation and an individual. We are simply dropping the words `body corporate' and replacing them with the word `person'. That is an all-inclusive definition. Amendments 43, 44 and 45 deal with section 193R, again dropping the words `body corporate' and replacing them with the word `person'. The word `person' includes the body corporate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendment No. 50 deals with the definition of an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trust, including the sort of trust that I mentioned earlier. Since trusts are referred to in the legislation, we need to touch on the definition. Our definition refers to trusts in which a majority of the beneficial interests are held by Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander persons, an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation, or a combination of any of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment broadens the eligibility for receipt of assistance under this bill. Various trusts are involved in a number of states and while persons do not need any definition, trusts do. We have also referred to trusts in our other amendments and that is another reason for this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will notice that the amendment uses the words `a majority of the beneficial interests are held'. It is therefore possible to have a situation where Aboriginal people have a beneficial interest in a trust in which other people, members of the wider community, also have a beneficial interest. With this bill, that trust could be the recipient of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another amendment relates to the granting of a benefit to Aboriginal people where they might not be the sole owners of the land; that is, where they could venture into a partnership with other members of the community. More and more these days, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders are exploring joint ventures and partnerships. In some of the more remote areas of Australia a good deal of eco-tourism is going on. Where an Aboriginal group wants to establish a station for tourism purposes, and other members of the community are in partnership with them, they would not be precluded from receiving benefits under this legislation. So the thrust of this bag of amendments is to include individual Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders so that grants are not simply made to a corporation&mdash;</PARA>

Under the proposed legislation, if they do not have a corporation they cannot receive assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation was intended to assist those who have been dispossessed, not artificial corporations. I make no criticism of the inclusion of corporations because they have their place. All we are saying is that it should not be mandatory to incorporate before benefits can be received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Evidence was received last year when the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee took evidence on the Native Title Bill and more recently when there was an inquiry into this bill to the effect that there are Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who want this amendment. They want a facility through which individuals and groups can receive the assistance intended for them. That is straightforward and commonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can still have the same level of accountability and the same controls over spending and over the criteria for making grants. This does not take away from the working of the legislation. Indeed, I think this sits better with the preamble to the Native Title Act. That preamble did not talk about dispossessed Aboriginal corporations; it talked about dispossessed Aboriginal people, human beings. That is why this is so important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it was Noel Pearson of the Cape York Land Council who said that he found it unfortunate that this notion of corporation was being forced on the Aboriginal community more and more.

As a matter of drafting, there is no basic difference between the Greens' and the coalition's amendments, but there is in terms of what they are trying to achieve. I am advised that, in terms of drafting style, consistency and completeness, the coalition's draft does its mischief rather more effectively than the Greens'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, if we are to have a reference to trusts, we would much prefer the Greens' amendment F9 to the opposition's No. 50 because there is a significant difference between the Green's proposal whereby, for a trust to be a beneficiary, each individual beneficiary must be an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. That is to be much preferred to the opposition's position, which merely requires a majority. That is a classic recipe for further dilution of the land base, which some of us at least are trying to preserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Procedurally, the best way through this might be for Senator Chamarette to withdraw her amendments, to the extent that she has already moved them, except for amendment F9, to the extent that she has already moved that. If she has not moved it, she might do so. We could then vote on that particular issue. If that vote gets up, the opposition can move its amendment with its version of the trust definition included in it. We can then move to a vote on the substance of the issue without these drafting complications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moving to the substance of the issue, might I say that the only good thing about this particular amendment is that it is moved in a fashion that enables the land corporation to make grants to individuals rather than requiring it to do so. It is only discretionary. It extends the range of options it has. It does not force it to give land to individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would argue very strongly that the principle of group ownership of land&mdash;or in the context of a loan or whatever&mdash;should be maintained. The intention of the land fund is and always has been, in relation to its acquisition functions, to provide community benefits. Ownership by corporations, which is the legal device to reflect that principle of community ownership, does strengthen accountability through the statutory requirements which are placed on such bodies, including the need for them to publicly report on their activities. So quite apart from anything else, the particular principle of accountability which the opposition is anxious for us to maintain would be much weakened if the options are opened up in the non-corporate directions which the opposition and the Greens are urging upon us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, a further point, and a really very crucial one, is that vesting of ownership in corporations ensures that land purchased remains part of the Aboriginal land base. I hope that Senator Chamarette and anyone else who might be minded to go down this other path takes very good notice of this. Vesting in corporations ensures that land purchased remains part of the Aboriginal land base for use by future generations of indigenous people. It is, of course, the case that Aboriginal people traditionally invariably held a communal form of title&mdash;moreover, an inalienable communal form of title. They are totally familiar with operating on a corporate basis. It is totally consistent with Aboriginal custom and tradition so far as land ownership is concerned. Anyone who purports to be sensitive to Aboriginal concerns and responsive to those concerns in this legislation ought to be prepared to accept that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the further point that it has been the longstanding policy not only of the Labor government but also of the former coalition government that grants of land should not be made to individuals. The Aboriginal Development Commission Act, passed back in 1980 by the Fraser government, provided for land acquisitions to be for corporations and trusts only, not for individuals. It is a longstanding policy. We have not had any articulate argument from opposition senators, apart from the fact that they have had a few representations from some people and they would rather like to have that option available to them individually. That is not a good reason, given the long policy tradition that has existed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis of that long policy tradition on both sides of the parliament was a concern, of course, to ensure that the widest number of people benefited, to maintain the social and cultural basis of communal land holding, and also for the accountability reasons that I have mentioned. So there are three specific reasons: to ensure that a wider number of people benefit, which ipso facto follows if you have some group ownership system rather than individual; to maintain that social and cultural basis of communal land holding; and also accountability because of the corporate structure and all the statutory obligations that flow from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have grants being made to trustees which, as I have acknowledged, has been part of the Fraser repertoire in the past, there is a problem. We would argue that we prefer to keep it to corporations. Grants to trustees would mean that non-indigenous individuals and corporations, if this particular provision is not changed, could acquire legal ownership of land under the bill. I suppose if one were to define those trusts very precisely in the way that is intended by F9, that particular problem would not arise. But if one does not, and one accepts the opposition amendment on its own terms, one does have that problem of dilution that I referred to there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could go around the traps on this many more times. I think the issues are starkly clear on this matter, as was the case when it was debated in the context of the Native Title Bill. The concepts of the arguments are essentially the same. I simply hope that some good sense will prevail on this matter and, in whatever form it now comes before us, it will be voted down. </PARA>

Therefore, I think it is important that we look at what we are trying to achieve in this whole area. I would have thought the object of the exercise was to reflect the issues of the actual community and members of that community rather than our deciding that somehow the best structure for them is a corporation, a trust or some collective vehicle. I think that is at the heart of what we are seeking to achieve here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that more than lip service should be paid to notions of self-reliance and individual responsibility. There should be a gaining of experience in actually working the land, rather than being remote from the process&mdash;for example, by being a director, the corporation then bringing in a manager and, to all intents and purposes, that director being sidelined. If someone else is actually taking the risks, making the day-to-day decisions, actually benefiting from the whole process and in due course making the actual decision about what happens with the land thereafter, we should not paternalistically pretend that we are the ones who ought to say who holds the land, on what terms and conditions, and what ought to happen to it in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose the analogy that I could draw is that of a housing commission building where no one actually has  individual ownership rights; there is not a corporate structure in place. As a result, no-one actually feels personally responsible for maintaining the external walls, let alone quite often the internal areas. We find there is not the same sense of pride, the same sense of ownership, the same sense of belonging and attachment that can come from individual ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is very important to have that philosophical component in this discussion. We are not simply doing it because we are somehow reflecting the views of mindless outsiders; we are doing it because they are saying to us that they want that particular right. After all, it is supposed to be for their benefit. Why should we be telling them what is in their best interests? That is, I would have thought, an outmoded approach. Therefore, I would hope that, consistent with that much more enlightened attitude, Senator Chamarette might reconsider in relation to amendment No. 50.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have in mind is that, as part and parcel of the experience that you gain from being in control of the land, you can also find it is very helpful and productive for the use of that land to operate in conjunction with others who would not necessarily be Aboriginal members of the community. Given that you still retain a majority interest, you can actually insist on arrangements that are win-win. In other words, you finally call the shots but you draw on their expertise, their involvement, maybe their provision of funds. In all sorts of ways you can have a much broader commercial arrangement. It does not mean that you give away any of your rights. It does not mean that you forgo your involvement with the land. It simply broadens the dimensions and allows the Aboriginal members to retain responsibility, at the same time giving them more flexibility to achieve the most desirable outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is very important that we allow people to take risks, not just to simply encourage dependency upon a corporate structure but, in circumstances where it is appropriate, for individuals themselves to feel that hands-on responsibility that can only make them feel much more involved in the whole process than some cold, corporate, distant structure which the government might think is in people's best interests but which the locals clearly do not. </PARA>

I do not think the government suddenly said one day, `Incorporation seems like a good way to go.' The basis of Aboriginal people's organisation, through their very kinship system, is communal. We have found that extremely difficult to understand in the past. I think it is passing strange, to use Senator Cook's language, that suddenly the opposition seeks to impose something of our values on something which is traditionally quite different for them. The basis of their society is really communal; it is collective and not individual. For Senator Alston to say that maybe a focus on individualism would be a remedy for the way they look after their houses, I think is drawing a bit of a long bow.

We are simply giving the ILC the power to do either. If that discretion is exercised responsibly, then where the local preference is for collective land holding, presumably, that is what they will do. Similarly, where there are individuals&mdash;and there are because we have had the same representations the Australian Democrats have had presumably on the matter&mdash;we will accommodate their local wishes and preferences.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The key point on the amendments which the opposition seeks to make is this: it is wrong to say that across Australia one system will meet the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal groups in different parts of the country with different cultural backgrounds. That is the key behind what the opposition seeks to achieve with this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate that there be different methods of land holding. A corporate structure is one of a number of possible outcomes, but there are other ways in which aspirations can be met. In some areas it may be appropriate for the land to be held by individuals. In other areas, because of the particular tribal relations, it may be appropriate for the land to be held by trustees upon a trust. That is just a simple statement of fact. But to say that corporate ownership is synonymous with communal ownership is, I think, a rather large leap of faith because the rules of the corporate world are not rules which readily translate into the rules of tribal custom. If one is to say that any structure represents the interests of Aboriginal groups, for example, in Queensland it may well be that it is better to say that it be held by trustees upon a trust rather than upon a corporation. For those reasons it is important that all of the possible means of land holding be available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next matter is one of aspiration. Those who oppose individual land holding are basically saying, `This land must always be held on a tribal basis,' notwithstanding the fact that at some future point in time it is in the better interests of the individuals who compose that tribal grouping to hold the land individually. That is a question of economic self-determination. If land is forever locked up into corporate structures, then individuals themselves lack economic self-determination. A tribal group may have economic self-determination but not the individuals. If this bill is to really meet the aspirations of not only tribal groupings of Aborigines but also individual Aborigines, then all of the forms of land holding which I have discussed must be available and that is why the opposition's amendment must be accepted. </PARA>

The crucial thing about this bill is that it has been structured in such a way that it ensures it does not impose anything on anybody. All it does is support the retention of the word `corporation', the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation. It then includes the word `or', which gives the ILC the discretion to choose, then `Aboriginal persons'. They may choose never to use that discretion.

We should really be listening to people. A couple of weeks ago Senator Ellison and I, in a car park out the back of the Meekatharra race club, consulted for hours with a bunch of very genuine Aboriginals whose families had lived in that area for probably hundreds, if not thousands, of years. They were severely dispossessed people from around Meekatharra. Quite frankly, I have as much faith in the views that I pick up when leaning on a utility at the back of the Meekatharra race course and talking to them about their problems of incarceration, alcoholism and dispossession from the land as I do when meeting some bureaucrat from ATSIC here in Parliament House. In fact, I give a lot more credence to those people I met that afternoon. So let us not get into a discussion about whom we have consulted.

The reality is that, if we have the flexibility to give assistance to individuals, trusts or corporations, we have the flexibility to arithmetically assist more Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islander people. Just because we have a corporation does not mean arithmetically that there are more people in it; it just means we have created a legal entity to incorporate those individuals in it. There is no reason why, if the government allows our amendment to have trusts, trustees and individuals, we could not have thousands more Aboriginals assisted. Quite frankly, arithmetically, three different potential methods of assisting people are better than one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last point I want to address in this contribution relates to amendment 50, which we are debating cognately. We seek, in another one of our amendments, to ensure that the assistance goes to not only Aboriginal groups, trusts or corporations that have in excess of 50 per cent ownership by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. We think that is again an unnecessary fettering of the ILC. In amendment 50 we have, firstly, defined trusts in part (a) and, secondly, in part (b), we have quite specifically ensured that the ILC has the flexibility once again to be able to assist Aboriginals where they may be entering a joint venture arrangement or some other arrangement where they may not, at the time of the purchase, have 50 per cent plus one equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe it is most important to do that. We have had representations and seen examples on the ground of proposals for developments, as Senator Ellison said, particularly in the tourism field, where it would be very sensible for indigenous Australians, if they so chose, to enter into agreements with other people who may wish to develop something but where it is just not economically feasible to do so with this 50 per cent plus one type of requirement. So we want to again build in the flexibility that ensures that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people can get assistance but in a minority area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the ILC may not choose to assist people in that way. It may say, `No, we really should assist corporations or trusts that have more than 50 per cent indigenous ownership.' That, of course, will be its decision. But we are saying that there may well be in the future, and even around the corner, situations where people point out to the ILC an eco-tourism development, as Senator Ellison said&mdash;it may be any other sort of tourism development or possibly even a mine or a pastoral lease&mdash;where the indigenous people could enter into an agreement with other people or another corporation but where the attainment of 50 per cent equity was not at the outset available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that ensuring there is not this arbitrary 50 per cent cut-off limit is sensible so as not to disadvantage people who could enter into those sorts of agreements.

If she reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, she will find she said something like `the coalition does not appreciate it'. If we want to treat indigenous people as equals, why not give them the same opportunity to hold land as we do? We can choose whether we hold it in a family partnership, whether we hold it in a corporation or whether we hold it individually. Why not give them the same opportunities? I could go on for a long time on this point. There is nothing wrong with individuals wanting to sell and buy other properties. We could build in safeguards about other ground and that sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point I want to talk about is this: if land is owned by a massive community&mdash;unless there is a good corporation running it military style&mdash;no-one can get the best out of the ground. But if the community were to break down into individual lots&mdash;when I say `individual', I include an individual family&mdash;there would be a good chance of improving the situation. I have seen a partnership which was going nowhere but which made progress when broken down into individuals&mdash;and there may be cases where one individual will go, even though he may have only a third of the property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have Aboriginals with individual holdings&mdash;and `individual' to me covers an ordinary family as we know it&mdash;they can be an example to others. I have seen this with my own eyes over the last 15 years, particularly in regard to what is happening with Mogumber. I am not necessarily saying that a big corporation style will fail, but one needs a lot more discipline to make it go. When no-one has individual responsibility for anything, things tend to fail. If we have a big disciplined organisation&mdash;military style or whatever&mdash;we can get it to go. That system will work better with smaller holdings and will be an example to others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Australian government is putting $1.4 billion into a land fund, I want to see it work. We see $1.3 billion going into ATSIC annually, and I want to see that work. One gets no pleasure from seeing an enterprise fail. If an enterprise is going to work, why not give it the best chance? I cannot see any objection whatsoever to getting down to individual ownership. If the Aboriginals want to trade their ground and buy other land, they should be able to do so. I said that previously during the second reading debate, but the minister did not place much importance on it; he believed there was a difference. Why should there be a difference? Aboriginals can sell some ground and pick up something else. As we know, priorities change. A priority for one year may be quite different in 10 years' time. I cannot see why we cannot go down the line as proposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I make the point again that there are three basic arguments why we are arguing for the bill as it is without extending the options as proposed. The first argument goes to accountability. The corporate form introduces a whole new set of obligations upon the holders of the land in question which are not evident in the law as it stands at the moment so far as individuals are concerned. For those on the other side&mdash;and perhaps not elsewhere&mdash;who are purported to be concerned about accountability, I believe that ought to be a relevant consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I repeat the argument&mdash;and I am not moved to waive it or abandon it by what has been said by the opposition&mdash;that a corporate form ipso facto necessarily involves a wider sharing of the benefits of the land fund than is available at the moment. Three options might be more than one option, yes, but any time we choose the option of giving land to an individual rather than being required to give the land to a corporation, ipso facto we are sharing the available funds less widely than would be the case if we went for the corporate form which requires, by definition, more than one member of the body corporate in order to constitute the&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nonetheless, in terms of the members of the body corporate it is to be assumed&mdash;and reasonably assumed&mdash;that that would be more widespread. Thirdly, there is the argument that the corporate form of ownership is the best way of maintaining the social and cultural basis of communal land holding. We had the proposition from Senator Campbell that it was an obscenity to suggest that this particular bit of white man's law could possibly approximate Aboriginal communal traditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to those three positive arguments of accountability, wider benefits and maintaining a closer legal approximation to traditional communal forms, there are two negative arguments that I think need to be made. The first is that any move away from requiring corporate status would in practice serve to dilute the Aboriginal land base that this is all about preserving. Senator O'Chee says that it is a form of economic self-determination to enable individuals to have a go at the pie in this respect. All I can say is that economic self-determination is just a flash way of saying that this is a recipe for diluting the Aboriginal land base. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to hear that Senator Campbell's sensitivity factor has gone up a few notches. This is a big change of heart for the Western Australian Liberals. I am making a technical argument, so shut up and listen! Section 191S at the present time does not provide for that circumstance. One might say that substituting the word `person' for the words `body corporate' would mean that some form of consent would be required in order to govern the disposal by way of succession law as well as any form of disposal. Maybe so, but what happens if the ILC withholds consent in that situation? We would have a nullity situation. The land could not go anywhere if there is no provision made for where it would go because there is no provision for reversion back to the stock of the ILC. So we are stuck with that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of any other amendment, one would assume that the intention of the opposition is that the land, under those circumstances, goes to the surviving non-Aboriginal spouse. That is fair enough as a matter of ordinary practice, but it means a dilution of what would otherwise be an Aboriginal land base. The whole point of this legislation is to try to give Aboriginal people a stake in the land that exists in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is nothing racist about that. That is the whole premise, the whole foundation of this legislation. If the opposition is creating the capacity to dilute that particular policy intent over time simply through the natural operation of the legislation, then we believe it is making a policy mistake. The opposition might not say it is a mistake; it might say it is a deliberate matter of intent, and I suspect that is right. What those on the other side of the chamber are really trying to do, with the utmost respect, is to introduce as many amendments as they possibly can to either make this particular legislation unworkable in practice&mdash;dragged along by the naivety of the Greens, as they were the other day, with that business about dispossession&mdash;or in principle to make it a different piece of legislation from that which it is intended to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is what those opposite want to do, and if they can gather the numbers in this place, that is fair enough, they will have it their way, but it will be on their consciences. However, at the end of the day those opposite may not have a bill. If we end up with a bill which does not serve the policy purposes that the government is intending, and which is the product of so much consultation with Aboriginal people around this country, those opposite will not have a bill being passed into law as a result. They need to be aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other negative reason for not accepting this amendment is that it involves yet another divisive new equation being brought into the situation. In his previous contribution on 20 October&mdash;at page 2131 of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>&mdash;Senator O'Chee made much of the potentially divisive implications of having a couple of different Aboriginal groups making competing claims. He made that contribution in the context of claims between native title based aspirants and those who were just seeking land under this particular legislative format. I quote Senator O'Chee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem is where different Aboriginal groups have competing claims to land. On Cape York Peninsula, an area with which I am very familiar, there are claims from different Aboriginal groups competing with the existing Wik claim. If one Aboriginal group in one part of the country makes a native title claim and another group seeks to access the fund to purchase some of that land subject to that claim, the result will be outright warfare between the two groups.</PARA>
<PARA>Just extend that kind of argument to a situation where, instead of the group as a whole seeking access communally through a corporate title response to particular land, we have different individuals claiming a piece of the action. Ipso facto necessarily we are going to be caught up in many more potentially internecine disputes between individual Aboriginal people who might otherwise have all their interests accommodated under a more communal, traditional and, in this context, corporate form of title. So there are those positive reasons for supporting the government's basic drafting and there are those negative reasons for opposing what is proposed by the opposition and the Greens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address a couple of points made by Senator Gareth Evans. Corporations, of themselves, do not offer any magic as to accountability or the fact that things will be run correctly. We merely have to look at the running of some Aboriginal corporations in Australia today. The registrar of those corporations puts out a report. If we look at that report we will see that a good number of those corporations are being investigated. A good number of them are being independently audited by accountants. That is living proof of the fact that some of these corporations ain't doing what they are supposed to be doing. I suggest to Senator Evans that a corporation is just as capable of misappropriating funds and is just as capable of doing the wrong thing as any individual or any group of people. Therefore, that argument in the first instance must fail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of how we bring those people to account is another matter. I still do not see any difference. When we bring a corporation to account, we still have to go through that mechanism. We have a whole piece of legislation dealing with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. We still have to go through the hurdles. Built into this bill are a number of requirements which could govern individuals and families just as much as corporations. If I recall it, one of our amendments is that, where a grant of money is made and it is not used for the purpose for which it was intended, the ILC can take recovery action. That can be done just as much with a corporation as an individual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we have a Flash Harry and his mates, they can take the money and run just as easily whether it is in their own names or a corporation. I have seen instances in Western Australia where groups which were supposed to have been the beneficiaries of such corporations are fighting with them because the directors of the corporation are doing things which those groups do not want done. They say they are being left out in the cold. Senator Evans should not think for one minute that corporations will make it one happy family, because there are living examples in Australia today where this mechanism is not providing the panacea that he thinks it does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to clause 191S&mdash;and I touch on that merely because Senator Evans has raised it&mdash;it is a restriction on the right to dispose of property. That clause effectively makes the Indigenous Land Corporation a landlord. It keeps the land virtually under the control of the Indigenous Land Corporation in perpetuity. That is not what I would suggest the preamble to the Native Title Act suggested when it set up and touched on this land fund. The Indigenous Land Corporation could well become one massive body which, in time, would control a good deal of land without the autonomy of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander recipients. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the coalition's view that if we make a grant, we make a grant and that is what it should be, and we should not have these ongoing strings attached. One of our amendments is that when the ILC makes a grant it does not retain an interest in the land granted, because then it becomes like a landlord&mdash;it can tell those people what it wants to do with the land and it can control them. That gives more than an implied power. It does not say that in the bill, but it does have the effect in clause 191S of an ongoing control by the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take it from Senator Evans's remarks that he is not in favour of a complete divesting of any interest to the recipients. If I have misunderstood him, will he please correct me. If he is saying that the recipients should receive the land to have and to hold and to alienate as they wish, then will he please make that clear. I understood him to be saying that clause 191S was a means of restricting this subsequent divesting, and that that is what he had against  Aboriginal persons being married to non-Aboriginal persons. He objected to the fact that those persons could then bequeath their land to their spouse. I understood that that was what he had a problem with, because he was thinking that the land was not then reaching the people it was intended to benefit. This is a basic point in relation to this piece of legislation: we either give land or we do not. If we retain strings by which we can control the people concerned, then we are not living by&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I put it to Senator Evans that, when he said that a grant can be made on such conditions as the ILC determines, he is giving the ILC carte blanche in fettering the grant. Our amendments propose that, when the grant is made, only specific aspects can be dealt with. We would take away the discretion from the ILC because we do not want the ILC to have such power and control.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a question of balance. We have to get the balance between giving the benefit to the people concerned and having some accountability at the end in the Indigenous Land Corporation, but not forwarding too much power to that corporation so that, in effect, it becomes a mini-government or a mini-council or body which can control Aboriginal affairs in a de facto sense. That is what we are against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that by granting land to individuals we are broadening the scope of assistance that we can give to Aboriginal people.

They would miss out on any assistance from this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us remember that corporations will not give any added protection. They have not worked that well thus far. As I said, they are still being investigated. If I could lay my hands on the report, I would give honourable senators the  number. Take it from me, the registrar is looking into a fair number of corporations due to complaints made by members of the Aboriginal groups as to how those corporations are being run. I am not saying that corporations are a bad thing on their own; I am just saying that they are not the complete answer; they are only part of it. We have to extend it and allow Aboriginal trusts, Aboriginal individuals and Aboriginal groups to be recipients of the benefit of this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The principles that Senator Gareth Evans referred to&mdash;the three positive principles underlying the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill in the form the government has presented it and the two negative principles&mdash;are worthy of just skimming through prior to what I intend to do, which is to withdraw amendments F1 to F8, which we have been addressing, and to accept the opposition's considerations of amendments Nos 4 to 45.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the principles that Senator Evans stated was the importance of group ownership within the Aboriginal community, and I do not think anybody disputes that. However, what we might dispute is the equivalence of the importance of communal ownership with corporations and the way in which non-Aboriginal law defines corporations. It is a big leap from communal ownership to incorporated bodies. That is the first response to Senator Evans's importance of group ownership within Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point he raised was that he saw the corporatons as a way of vesting in the future, and a way of Aboriginal communities having a corporation structure which protects their land into the future. We have no opposition to that principle. The only opposition we have is to the government making a requirement of it and restricting the operation of this land fund to that principle, and that principle alone, as a way of enshrining and protecting communal ownership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that Senator Evans raised was the increase in accountability that is provided by this restriction. I ask: accountability to whom? It is quite clear in this bill that the main restrictions on the ways in which the fund can operate are all directed towards the recipients of the money, grants or land and that the freedom and openness is given to the government appointed body, the board. It has almost total freedom&mdash;so much freedom that the government does not even want it to have aims, objects and principles by which its enactment of the legislation can be reviewed and monitored. Yet, on the other hand, we have this restrictiveness which is supposed to increase accountability. Our feeling is that it does not increase accountability to the Aboriginal community; it increases accountability to the government and to non-Aboriginal bureaucracies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am tempted to mention a joke in this regard. I will mention only the first third of the joke and not go to the punch line; but I think it vividly illustrates our concerns. It is a very sad reflection that this joke can often be reflected in similar ways in day-to-day life&mdash;and I think it is in this legislation. It is about an Aboriginal person who goes to his local store and obtains a bunch of groceries. As he is leaving, the shop owner notes that he has a tin of dog food. The shop owner says, `Where's your dog?' He says, `I've come for miles. My land's way over there and I haven't brought my dog.' The shop owner says, `We can't give you this dog food until you show us your dog.' He says, `Break it down. We can't bring our dog in every time we want to buy dog food.' The shop owner says, `Oh yes, but we know sometimes you people eat this food.' So, dutifully, the Aboriginal person brings his dog and then gets given his can of dog food. The same thing gets repeated for cat food and for toilet paper. I will leave the committee to imagine the main part of the joke.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the humour covers something very serious, which is paternalism and the capacity for a government to give with one hand and take back in a boomerang action if its own requirements are not fulfilled. So I do not see the three positive points that Senator Evans raised as positive; I see them as questionable and, in some cases, paternalistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans made some negative points about changing to the opposition's suggestions to preserve the land base. For whom is the land base being preserved? Aboriginal people do not actually have it at the moment. If the government is preventing them from getting it in order to preserve an Aboriginal estate, by whom is that estate owned? The second point that was raised points out very clearly who owns it&mdash;the ILC, which we are just setting up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on section 191S, Senator Evans said, `This unfortunate situation where an Aboriginal person may want to bequeath his inheritance to a non-Aboriginal person might force the ILC to withhold its consent to the disposal of the land to the legitimate person who has inherited it.' I think that is outrageous but I do think it is inherent in the act, and we will deal with that matter later on no doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that Senator Evans raised was the divisive potential for the situation of different groups that might be involved. I would point out that one cannot automatically create division where it does not exist. As Senator Ellison pointed out quite clearly, just having a legal entity like a corporation does not make one happy family; it still leaves the problems that may exist. Let me give an example of justice not always being served by having a restriction to a corporation's structure. I refer to a family by the name of Dan in Nevada. Only that family was the legitimate unit which had a particular claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So for three reasons we support the opposition amendments. Even though we are withdrawing our amendments, which are identical, we believe that the first principle we are supporting is that of justice&mdash;that justice may not be served to all people if it is restricted in this particular way in terms of allocation of funds or land. The second principle is flexibility. We are not specifying that the ILC has to go beyond the structure. We are saying that it has a legitimate right to make the best decision possible for a particular area of land and the particular unit that will be best served within the Aboriginal community, whether that is a person, a family, a family trust, or a corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third and most important principle in respect of which we support these amendments is that of self-determination and a rescinding of the paternalistic principles underlying this constraint.

That deals with a situation where someone can apply for a grant of land and then come back again under the guise of a corporation and apply again in relation to the same piece of land. For instance, a person gets a piece of land, divests himself of it and then comes back and tries to apply again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make my response to Senator Kernot. She is incorrectly implying that we are failing to give regard to the Aboriginal groups which have said that the corporations structure is a very appropriate one for them. That is fine. They are entitled to speak for that, and nothing in these amendments excludes it. What we are refusing is their request to restrict it to this method for somebody else apart from those who have also spoken to us and asked that such a restriction not be included in this legislation. We believe that it is one of these areas where flexibility should be given to the ILC and the management of the fund and that the ILC should not be given a tied turkey to begin with. It should be given the flexibility. If it does not choose to exercise that range of responses, that is fine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is all that the different Aboriginal groups that have approached us have been asking. There is an unwillingness that the restriction be placed upon the allocation of the money or access to the land acquisition fund. What we are opposing by these amendments is a restriction that is in the legislation which we believe to be inappropriate. We are not excluding any of the people who voluntarily nominate to accept the corporations structure and all the benefits that may be derived from that. We simply say to get a consensus position where all the groups are happy we have to look at supporting the wide variety of responses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than not listening, we are listening to everybody. So we are not `not listening', to anybody. In fact, if the truth be known, the people the Democrats are not listening to are the ones who say, `We don't want it restricted purely in the way in which it is in this legislation. We would like to be able to argue amongst ourselves about the validity of the different measures in which we can approach the land fund.' It may well be that individuals will never get, as has been pointed out in the debate earlier, a grant through this land acquisition fund. They may in themselves realise that they have a better chance if they come with a family, a community or a structure of a corporation. But that then is essentially up to them and it is in their hands. That is the basis on which we support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I would like briefly to add to that point by asking rhetorically what Senator Chamarette would say to a group of Aboriginal people who came along and said, `We have seen the abuses that can occur with corporate structures, the disempowerment that flows from being a minority shareholder, the abuses of power that can occur when you separate ownership from control and we therefore prefer direct ownership so that we are in control of our own destinies, we are responsible for the way in which we handle the land and we have the ultimate title.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to rebut a couple of the arguments put by Senator Gareth Evans. I wanted to talk again about this business about trying to help more people. He reiterated his argument that corporation by its very nature will ensure that more people get assisted because more people can be incorporated. I still do not understand his argument. The reality is that under this system we have three, four or more potential different ways of owning land. It is quite possible that we would have a corporation with 10 or 15 indigenous people in it. We might have a trust with 100 people in it. Quite frankly, under the system that we are proposing, with the support of the Greens, it is arithmetically, using the minister's own logic, possible to assist more Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the argument in relation to whether we need to mandate that it must be a body corporate that holds the land as opposed to creating a flexibility we have has a logic that is just entirely inescapable. I just cannot see why the Democrats would seek to impose one structure upon Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people when we are offering a choice. It may be quite appropriate for the Kimberley Land Council, the Northern Land Council, ATSIC and so forth to go to the ILC and put very strong arguments why a person, a trust or a family should not be granted the land. But the thing is the government is trying to say&mdash;I do not know whether it is being swayed by the logic at all&mdash;`You must have a corporate structure and nothing else.' All we are doing is saying that there should be a choice. I cannot see how anyone could possibly suggest that we have any other sort of agenda. Senator Evans has said we have come here to make it unworkable. I cannot see how he can possibly&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the point which I found one of the most disgraceful things that I have heard Senator Evans say when he was using the argument about the Aboriginal man marrying a non-Aboriginal woman and what would happen if the man were to pass away and pass it on to his non-Aboriginal wife. When I suggested by way of interjection that they may have children and the children may inherit the land, he said, `Just for the sake of the argument, pretend they don't have any children.' That is a pretty good argument to base it on! I want to tell Senator Evans what a nasty argument that is to use, as what he is really saying is that under the government's scheme people would have to be very careful about who they married. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not because we are talking about expanding the policy base and the government is talking about constricting it because the people that the government negotiates with are generally the big politically organised Aboriginal groups. Mr Dillon tabled for us during an inquiry of the Finance and Public Administration Committee a list of who the government had so-called consulted with. We saw exactly who they were. It is on the public record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer anyone here who wants to see who the government talks to when it talks about Aboriginal affairs to this Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration hearing where Mr Dillon very kindly, with the minister's agreement, I presume, tabled a list of all of those people who have been consulted about this bill. They are, almost without exception, the politically organised Aboriginal groups. There is nothing wrong with that sort of consultation, but the government should not say that it has consulted all over the place when it has basically consulted with those who agree with its ideas in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I just say how obscene the prospect is of what Senator Evans was saying. He is saying that where an Aboriginal man who had been granted land dies, having decided to bequeath that land to his wife and possibly his children, the ILC may decide, using the powers under 191S, that it would not allow that transfer to take place. This brings us back to that central issue of the perpetual control that the ILC has under the government's scheme. We will get to this at a later stage in the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is on the evidence given by Mr Dillon to the Finance and Public Administration Committee&mdash;and it was highlighted by Senator Chamarette, who asked a question of Mr Dillon. When asked about the assets of the ILC, he referred to the investments in the trust but then went on to say, `We regard that the ILC will have more assets than this.' He specifically said, `I think the analysis presented ignores the overall structure.' He went on to say, `We actually have a much larger asset than the asset in the fund. We also have the land that the ILC purchases.' So it is regarded, maybe at least in the mind of one of the people responsible for drafting the bill, that the asset of the land that the ILC purchases resides in the fund and resides in the ILC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a very fundamental philosophical difference here. The coalition and the Greens very much support vesting the land in the hands of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people for their benefit. The government sees that the ILC needs to maintain this link with the land in perpetuity, and that link is created through section 191S. But Senator Evans has raised that spectre and it needed to be rebutted. That is the fundamental difference between our approach and the government's approach. I think we all understand where that difference is, but that is where it lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that one can still maintain accountability, can still maintain the objects of the act and maintain the very important principles of assisting dispossessed Aboriginals without maintaining the paternalistic control that the government's bill in its current form perpetuates. </PARA>

One may get some supporting nourishment from the corporations power as well in this context, but that is not the reason why it is drafted this way. The reason why it is drafted this way is to preserve the principle of communal title rather than individual title.

But if it only takes a skip in time for that particular land purchased for Aboriginal people to pass on to non-Aboriginal people, through the mechanism of succession, as I have described it, then it is pretty much a windfall benefit at the expense of the taxpayers for someone who might be thoroughly deserving in individual terms, and I am not in any way casting aspersions on that. Just assume the situation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not an assumption of anything of the kind.

It is as simple and straightforward as that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite rightly, Senator Evans regards it as very offensive to talk in terms of degrees of aboriginality. But it just happens when we get to someone who is not an Aboriginal person, Senator Evans assumes, in effect, that they have no attachment with the Aboriginal community, that they have just gone in there for the sake of the marriage, that once they inherit the land, they will be up and off. I regard that as quite offensive. I think it implies that they really have no attachment to the community, to their spouse, to the people that they live with. One cannot get much closer to people than to marry them. To somehow think that because somebody then inherits the land or owns it means that they will turn their back on everything that ever brought them to that married state, seems to me to be very offensive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I would have thought Senator Evans would not be quite as heartless as that in trying to draw this strict line. He is effectively saying to Aboriginal people, `Marry outside your community at your peril, because you, and only you, will be unable to pass on land to your spouse'. Where is the fairness in that? I would have thought, just as it ought to go both ways, that the non-Aboriginal person ought to be able to bequeath land to the Aboriginal person, why should it not work in the opposite direction? After all, one is trying to achieve a cohesive structure, not draw artificial and divisive lines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought it is a classic example of not thinking this through because the government is wedded at all costs to this central power structure. It really does not want to break down the power and allow people to have control over their own lives, control over who they marry, control over who they bequeath land to. Senator Evans's obsession is with maintaining this land base irrespective of who benefits, irrespective of which is the local community, irrespective of the fact that the spouse might be actually very happy indeed for that to happen. Senator Evans says, `No, I am sorry. The greater national good requires me to tell you that you can't do it because we have got this grand commitment to a land base'. If that is not putting the individual last, I do not know what is. </PARA>

Where there is inalienable title obviously there are prima facie problems about mortgaging it and getting creditors participating in the financing of it. Accordingly, there needs to be a provision for guarantee arrangements. That is why the legislation is full of all those complex provisions dealing with just that.

<PARA>We have already debated this amendment. Now that throughout the bill as amended we have reference to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts, there needs to be a definition of a trust. We seek to define that in two ways. The first is a broad definition in (a), where the beneficial interests are held by Aboriginal persons, Torres Strait Islanders and so forth. In (b) the potential is created for beneficial interests where the majority ownership may not be Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ownership. It specifically ensures that the details of that ownership are made known to the Indigenous Land Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned this briefly in the previous debate. The crucial effect of subclause (b) is that if there is an instance where a corporate entity needs to be established to either purchase or develop land, there be no severe restriction such that there needs to be a 50 per cent Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander ownership. In other words, it is envisaging the possibility that there may be circumstances where it would be of assistance to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people to enter into arrangements that do not reflect majority ownership in the initial stages. They are the fundamentals: firstly, it establishes a broad definition of trusts and, secondly, it envisages what would happen if there were not majority ownership. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For reasons similar to those I have previously indicated, if we are to have a definition of `trust' we would much prefer one in which all the beneficiaries are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people To allow for up to 49 per cent non-Aboriginal participation creates yet again the potential to in effect dilute the land base that has been laboriously created by this fund.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to respond and then the opposition might confirm whether I have understood its amendment correctly. I must say that Senator Gareth Evans is always so good whenever he is parodying anything. While he is distressed by what he sees as the Greens' capacity to turn on a sixpence, I have to say that I have talked myself into supporting opposition amendment No. 50. The reason for that, apart from advice received from a number of sources, is that I want to maintain a consistent line. If this raft of amendments is not simply to tie down the ILC but to allow it flexibility and the maxi</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My understanding of the difference between that amendment and the foreshadowed Greens' amendment F9&mdash;which, I might add, I will withdraw if the opposition amendment succeeds&mdash;is that the opposition amendment allows a majority of beneficial interests to be held within an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trust by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Our amendment F9 assumed a 100 per cent membership. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition amendment assumes that Aboriginal people can go into this option with their eyes open. If they are already in a trust structure, it may be an unreasonable restraint and disadvantageous to demand 100 per cent Aboriginal membership. Providing for a majority of Aboriginal membership could allow for joint ventures&mdash;for example, in eco-tourism&mdash;for which a non-Aboriginal member with a minority interest in a trust might be willing to provide capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment will increase the options available to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander trusts to do things which, without that freedom, they might not be able to do at all. On the grounds that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people should have the freedom to make mistakes and to exercise options which, in the long term, might benefit them, and on the same basis that we supported the previous opposition amendments, the Greens will be supporting opposition amendment No. 50. To refute some comments once made to me by the Clerk of the Senate, I have been swayed by the force of the arguments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am willing to concede that proposed subclause (b) of the amendment is not clear enough and it needs to be made clearer. What proposed subclause (b) seeks to do, of course, is to ensure that, where there are other people who are not indigenous land holders, who are not Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders, holding a beneficial interest in the trust&mdash;and as Senator Chamarette said, it is too restrictive to say that 100 per cent must be Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;the details of the other beneficial interests are provided to the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA></TALK.START>

So it may be that all we need to do is say (a) `and' (b)&mdash;not `or'&mdash;where details of the ownership have been provided. So we would leave out all words prior to `where'. That seems to me to give effect to what we have in mind. As I say, it may be best if we stand this provision down in order to clarify that that wording does the trick. Otherwise, I think we concede Senator Harradine's point. It was never the intention to have a majority on the one hand but then, by a back door, a minority. We always intended that where there was less than total Aboriginal ownership, the identity of the non-Aboriginal holding ought to be made known to the ILC.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to this matter, I draw the attention of the committee to our proposed amendment No. 51. That relates to proposed new subsection 4B which appears at page 45 of the bill&mdash;that is, the definition of indigenous-held land. The government has said that we cannot have land management for indigenous-held land unless it fits the description contained in 4B(1). The government says that an interest in the land is sufficient if it is not less than 50 per cent. So what the government has done in its own bill is to bring in this concept of a majority, because in defining indigenous-held land it says that an interest is an interest as long as it does not consist of less than 50 per cent. You can only contribute, under that section which deals with funding for land management activities, where it is indigenous-held land. If we look at the definition of indigenous-held land, we find that 4B(1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of this Act, land is <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">indigenous-held land</EMPHASIS> if, and only if:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)an interest in the land is held by an Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander corporation; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)an interest in the land is held by an Aboriginal person or a Torres Strait Islander.</PARA>
<PARA>So far, so good. If we look at the `interest' section, we find that it states that, for the purposes of subsection (1), an interest in land is to be ignored if it is less than 50 per cent. So the government itself has brought in this notion of a majority, of a holding of more than 50 per cent. It has brought that in under the definition of indigenous-held land. I submit that the government did not have the definition of a trust because trusts were not envisaged. It only talks about corporations. But with regard to that question of not less than 50 per cent, if we accept the trust situation, it should flow through that the interest in the trust should be not less than 50 per cent. What I am saying is that if there is going to be a clean line of logic, to use the expression by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the government should translate it into the definition of a trust as well, because it is certainly doing that in its definition of indigenous-held land, when it talks about not less than 50 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I would like to be kind but I cannot be, because he is talking nonsense. There is a difference, in the announced scheme in the legislation&mdash;and there always has been, from day one&mdash;between spending taxpayers' money for acquisition of land and spending it for management of land. With regard to the acquisition of land, it is proposed to apply a rigorous principle of the kind we are here describing. If we are going to be spending $45 million a year on land acquisition, we want to be pretty sure that we are doing it for the purpose of building and maintaining an Aboriginal land base.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, other ways in which Aboriginal people can acquire land, not only under the Native Title Act but through the ordinary operation of the general law. There are circumstances in which it is envisaged that the ILC might want to devote some proportion&mdash;presumably not very much&mdash;of the fund to assist in the development, basically, of Aboriginal enterprise which is land related. In that context, moneys are made available for management purposes to those bodies of land which are described as indigenous and defined in terms of the majority principle. But it is stretching a pretty long bow to argue in turn that that provision, which is solely to do with management funding, should relate back to these very different acquisition principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to Senator Alston's drafting exercise, I suppose it is not good enough to argue against something on the ground of inelegance. It is going to look like a thing of shreds and patches by the time we are finished with it, anyway, if you lot continue your present disposition. Certainly, it deals with the particular problem in that bit of drafting that Senator Harradine identified&mdash;it does take out the possibility of construing it as available to a minority Aboriginal interest. I concede that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit odd, however, to build it in as part of the definition, not only a definition of the status of the ownership but also of who has notified what to whom.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to clarify one aspect before we go any further. I understood Senator Gareth Evans to say, `In land acquisition, the interest must be 100 per cent. But when it comes to land management&mdash;that is, the follow-up with funding to manage the land&mdash;you only need to have an interest of not less than 50 per cent.' I think that the logic in that case is more than flawed. It is a fundamental error to say, `We will give you land only if it is 100 per cent yours. But when we give you money for the maintenance of that land, we don't mind if the interest is not less than 50 per cent.' I do not see that it flows on from that.

We are working in conjunction with another outside group as a joint venture. We have 75 per cent and we want to acquire this land for eco-tourism, but it can't be granted to us because 100 per cent has to apply.' There is an uneven playing field as far as that goes.

<PARA>Amendment No. 5A , which was circulated today, refers to `grants&mdash;terms and conditions'. Amendment No. 57 has also been circulated. That, too, has a paragraph headed `Grants&mdash;terms and conditions'. These are amendments to subclauses 191D(2) and 191E (2). Clause 191D deals with the land acquisition functions of the Indigenous Land Corporation, and clause 191E deals with the land management functions. Thus, one clause deals with acquisition and the other deals with management&mdash;two matters we have just been debating. I will deal with the amendments sequentially. Amendment No. 5A states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A guarantee is subject to such terms and conditions as the Indigenous Land Corporation determines.</PARA>
<PARA>The language is mirrored in the opposition amendment No. 57. That deals with questions of loans. Amendment No. 57 states:</PARA>

<PARA>There is some overlapping in the clauses because of subclause 2&mdash;2A and 2B. I will talk about that in general terms. It was felt that there had to be some sort of accountability; that is, the Indigenous Land Corporation had to have some control over the grants that were made. We have said previously that a grant should be made to a person to have and to hold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when there is a loan, conditions obviously have to apply to it. Loans have to be made on a commercial basis, so that the purpose for which the money is to be spent, the method of repayment, et cetera can be spelt out. Of course, interest could apply and there could be security&mdash;for instance, some sort of encumbrance lodged in relation to the land. With respect to a guarantee, we cannot be as specific with that as we can with a loan. It was thought that it was best to leave the guarantee on such terms and conditions as the Indigenous Land Corporation determined. I think that is self-evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to a grant of money, we have to look to the purposes for which the money is granted. That money should be used for the purpose for which it is given. Obviously, there are aspects to the giving of information. The Indigenous Land Corporation could not oversee these provisions without having the relevant information before it. That is why there is this provision for the imposing of a condition upon the recipient to provide information. After all, the first stepping stone to accountability is that there be some power for the process to be scrutinised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the coalition is proposing that there be adequate accountability, that an overseeing of the grants, loans or guarantees be made, but that it not be onerous to the extent that the Indigenous Land Corporation can fetter the recipients unduly. I notice that the Greens' amendments might have a similar flavour. However, they are not perhaps in the same form as those of the coalition. This is an absolutely essential point because, if the Indigenous Land Corporation is to act in the best interests of both the beneficiaries of this legislation and the Australian taxpayer, it must have the ability to impose certain conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, at the same time, we do not want that corporation becoming a sort of monolithic alternative government with no avenue of appeal, which can hamstring the recipients in such a way that it becomes a burden or is indeed used as a political tool. That is a fear that the coalition has in relation to the Indigenous Land Corporation: if we have a corporation which is all powerful and omnipresent, it has the ability to lose sight of the original reason for the setting up of this land fund. Of course, the people who will suffer, the people who will lose out, are the intended beneficiaries of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the Indigenous Land Corporation will go that way, but legislation is about checks and balances. Good legislation sets out to do what the intention says it should do. It should be effective and workable. I believe that it is. It provides a balance which is fair to the recipients but at the same time affords some control to the Indigenous Land Corporation. A fundamental aspect of the bill is that the Indigenous Land Corporation has these powers. I commend these amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

The basic problem with H1 is not so much as it refers to guarantees and loans because there the reference is to terms and conditions&mdash;albeit not as fully expressed as in the opposition amendment, but the essence of it is there. The difficulty is that part of Green amendment H1 which talks about grants of money as distinct from loans or guarantees. There, it simply imposes one condition only: that the grant be used solely for the purposes for which it is granted. That is an entirely reasonable and legitimate condition, but there may well sensibly be other conditions as well in that the terms and conditions are associated with any default provision in the event of non-payment of remaining amounts and so on. Under those circumstances, the draft proposed by the opposition after discussion with the government is the way to go. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal with the same point because I think it has wider application, and therefore it is important that we understand why we are going down this path. It is very dangerous to allow anyone an unfettered discretion and assume that somehow he will always act in good faith or he will not act in good faith.

<PARA>These three amendments are quite simple and cover much the same ground by replacing the words `have regard to the desirability of' with the words `give priority to'. I am looking at clauses 191D(3), 191E(3) and 191F(2). Clause 191D requires that `for the purpose of the performance of the Indigenous Land Corporation's land acquisition functions the Indigenous Land Corporation must have regard to the desirability of the following'. That clause requires the ILC to have regard to the desirability of fulfilling its functions. This requirement is echoed in the other sections I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is saying that that should be strengthened to saying `give priority to'. It is turning it up a couple of notches, so to speak, to say that the goals and the purposes for the carrying out of the ILC's functions are not just desirable, but are a priority&mdash;that the ILC must give priority to these goals and tenets of its function. It is really a question of wording, I suppose, but the coalition believes that it needs attention because `having regard to the desirability' of something rests on the balance of probabilities. It is thought that that is not a sufficient standard. `Giving priority' requires somewhat more attention. That is really the thrust of these amendments. </PARA>

It is a meaningless proposition, basically, to talk in terms of priority. The opposition is using the word `priority' because it has a sort of oomph feel or look about it; it looks a bit more than desirable for something to be priority. But in the process it is just perverting language. We only give priority to X over Y or Z; we only give priority to A over B or C or D.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A very close and longstanding friend of mine and, indeed, of many in this parliament, a wonderful professional colleague and a very great Australian, Dr Peter Wilenski AC, last Thursday morning, 3 November, died at the unhappily young age of 55 after a long and very courageous battle with cancer. It is with enormous personal sadness that I take this parliamentary opportunity to express my own and the government's sincerest condolences and deepest sympathy to his wife Jill, to his children Michael and Katy and, indeed, to other members of his family in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will have the opportunity to speak at Peter Wilenski's funeral in Sydney tomorrow and perhaps also at the memorial service which is planned for Canberra on 22 November. But let me take this opportunity to place on the parliamentary record at least some of the things that I said in the statement that I released as Minister for Foreign Affairs the day Peter Wilenski died. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Wilenski made a phenomenal contribution to the public life of Australia and internationally during his quite exceptional public service career&mdash;a contribution duly recognised with an award in the Order of Australia in 1987 and his further well deserved elevation to Companion in the Order earlier this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His most recent contributions were as permanent representative and ambassador to the United Nations from 1989-92 and as Secretary to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 1992-93. He made a major impact in New York&mdash;rare for any ambassador not of the permanent five&mdash;because he combined, in an unparalleled way, a vigorous and deeply perceptive intellectual engagement, with an extraordinary talent for organisational reform and a deep commitment to the cause of social justice internationally. His painstaking work in putting together the so-called Wilenski group&mdash;a regionally mixed group of ambassadors who met over a six-month period to put together a package of measures on reform of the UN top structure&mdash;still stands as the major point of reference for UN secretariat reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, such was his contribution to the United Nations that the Secretary-General&mdash;in what I think must be a most unusual gesture&mdash;sent me a cable of condolence just a couple of days ago which I would like to read into the record. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was profoundly saddened to learn of the death of Dr Peter Wilenski and would like to add my own voice to all those who are mourning his passing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wilenski was a diplomat and scholar of the highest calibre. While representing his country at the United Nations, he also served the international community with integrity and distinction, advancing the debate about the role and future of the world organisation. Although I arrived in New York only a few months before his return to Australia, I soon came to appreciate his legacy in promoting the goals of the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Wilenski will be greatly missed by his many friends in New York, both in the secretariat and in the permanent missions to the United Nations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I extend my condolences to the government and people of Australia on the loss of a fine statesman and a man of great compassion and humanity.</PARA>
<PARA>It is signed by Boutros Boutros-Ghali. In New York, Peter Wilenski was in the very front line of the changes wrought in the international landscape with the end of the Cold War. It was thus not surprising that he brought back to his administration of my department an awareness of the need to adjust to change. He was acutely conscious of the importance of ideas and encouraged officers to develop a profound understanding of the issues on which they worked in order to make sure their contribution to Australia's future would always be far more than just ensuring that the processes of government worked well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although he had a very lively, extensive and extended career in student politics&mdash;where I first met him&mdash;Peter Wilenski first really came to public prominence as Gough Whitlam's principal private secretary from 1972-74. He then set about rebuilding the foundations of Australia's public administration&mdash;first of all as special adviser to the Coombs Royal Commission on government administration in 1974; then as foundation professor of the Australian Graduate School of Management from 1977-81; as adviser to the New South Wales and Tasmanian Labor governments; and, most importantly of all, after a brief period as secretary to the department of education and youth affairs, as Chairman of the Public Service Board under the Hawke Labor government from 1983-87. In this last position, he set about achieving fundamental reform of the Public Service&mdash;substantially changing its culture, inculcating the values of responsiveness and equity and attuning it to the needs of a new style of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became minister of the newly amalgamated department of transport and communications, I could think of no-one better equipped than Peter Wilenski to weld together in this new department the kind of new performance culture that we were striving for, and no-one better equipped to guide the bold new policy courses we were charting in government business enterprise reform. Peter Wilenski performed brilliantly as secretary to that department working with me in 1987-88. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the many phases of his career there were some powerful common themes. I cannot think of anyone in the history of Australian public service who has done more than Peter Wilenski to bring the concepts and language of social justice, responsiveness, access and equity into the common lexicon of public administration. The quality of his intellectual contribution can be measured in the huge changes he initiated, many of which have been fully integrated into Australian life&mdash;their origins forgotten now by many, but no less a monument for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, his work in initiating a significant and continuing improvement in the degree of equal opportunity for women will remain a source of courage, support and inspiration to all who believe in the dignity and worth of all human beings. I have heard him described as the first real feminist in the country. I cannot say whether that is strictly accurate but, equally, I cannot think of anyone who would be more deserving of that title of the first male feminist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Wilenski's commitment in all these respects perhaps stemmed from his eclectic but very profound academic background&mdash;coupled with his unusual childhood in a Polish Jewish immigrant family, all of which seemed to combine to give him a fresh and quite trenchant view of perhaps the clever outsider and may well have contributed also to his rather enchantingly dry sense of humour. All the time he drew together themes and issues, making innovative connections between disciplines. That was a characteristic which was reflected in every aspect of his life's work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know how deeply Peter's loss will be felt by his family&mdash;particularly his wife Jill Hager, with whom he had such a wonderful relationship&mdash;and his friends. My heart goes out particularly&mdash;as I think all our hearts do&mdash;to his two little children who came into his life only very recently. At the time he became secretary to my department, with all its challenges, his son Michael was only two years old and his daughter Katy was just a baby. The broken nights must have kept Peter exhausted&mdash;I know they did&mdash;but, equally, I know that he approached their early childhood with all the same intellectual curiosity and interest, to the extent of testing their IQs at fairly regular intervals, that characterised his approach to all other important issues in his life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He looked for ways that he and others with family responsibilities might adjust their lives to be able still to make a full professional contribution without sacrificing the interests and needs, not to mention the joy, that comes with children. It is a source of very great sadness that Michael and Katy will not have the pleasure of a life together with such a father. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Wilenski was a remarkable combination of compassion, intellect, vision, energy and effectiveness. He was a very fine public servant, a very great friend to have, a delightful human being and, as I said at the outset, a very great Australian. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the opposition and other honourable senators for their courtesy in allowing me to speak out of sequence. I would like to join with Senator Gareth Evans in the remarks which he has made. He has eloquently made a comprehensive statement about the life and times of Peter Wilenski and it has been supported by remarks from all sides of the parliament in the House of Representatives. I will not abuse the privilege that the Senate has given me to speak somewhat out of sequence by speaking for long, although there is an inordinate amount that could be said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Peter Wilenski was to me, as he was to so many others in the parliament, a good friend and I, like so many others, regarded him as one of the great Australians that I have known in my life. He was, above all things, committed to public service in the broadest sense and to the possibility that the government and the Public Service could play a role in improving the lives of people all round the world, people in need and, of course, because of his role here, particularly Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is most remarked for his great contribution to the reform of public administration, to the process of public administration. He was involved in that process for a very long time in very many of the ways in which Senator Evans referred, which I will not repeat but which are properly recorded. I recall when he was appointed at the age of 35 to be secretary of the then Department of Labour and Immigration. It was regarded then as a very controversial appointment. In hindsight, people would regard it as the start of a great Public Service career, but in the context of the turbulent times of 1975 it was regarded as a controversial appointment. Dr Wilenski made a substantial contribution to the department's administration and its culture. He may have shocked some of the people by, as I am advised, turning up in his denim jacket to work as secretary of the department, but in more substantial ways, as well as symbolic ways, he made a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of his contribution to public process which has been emphasised, I just want to say briefly that it was always about purpose, not about process&mdash;about policy, about ideas, about a willingness to challenge the orthodoxy. I think the more profound contribution that he made was to pursue process with a purpose, and not merely the very demonstrable and substantial reforms that he made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these brief comments, I wish to comment on the splendid diversity of his interests and contribution. He started with a career in medicine. He was, as others have said, substantially involved in great issues of foreign policy and public administration; but he also made a very substantial contribution to the arts in Australia, most recently on the council of the National Gallery of Australia. He was a person of breadth and depth. Those talents are rare, and he will be greatly missed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to be associated with the expressions of regret at the passing of Peter Wilenski, as would my colleagues on this side of the chamber. I had considerable dealings with Peter Wilenski in recent years both in his position as permanent representative of Australia's mission at the United Nations in New York and then as the departmental head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my dealings with him, I found Peter Wilenski always courteous, constructive and helpful. There is no doubt about his fine intellect&mdash;it was obvious after even the shortest discussion on any subject&mdash;and there is no doubt about his efforts as a reformer both in domestic public affairs and also internationally. I remember his efforts at reform of the United Nations in New York. It is a pity in many ways that some of his initiatives were not more enthusiastically adopted by the powers that be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was a man who in recent times was obviously fighting a terminal illness with great courage. The fact that he battled on so long with the duties of public affairs was not only a credit to him but demonstrated his commitment to the betterment of the state and of the community as a whole. We send our condolences to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I begin my normal adjournment topic that I was hoping to speak to, I want to add my words to those that have been expressed about the sad death of Peter Wilenski. I too extend my condolences and acknowledge the depth of respect I felt for him and the contribution he made in the area of social justice. I extend concern to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight I am talking about another death, and that is the death of our forests. As we sit here this evening, conservationists from around the country have set up a forest tent embassy outside this building to draw attention to the urgent need to protect ancient giant trees, rare and endangered species and fragile forest ecosystems from the continuing destruction for woodchips. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be extremely grateful to these people who have worked long and hard to communicate their concern for the future of our forests to those who have the power to protect them. The time has come for this government and governments around Australia to act on this concern and the overwhelming concern in the wider community. Ignorance cannot be used as an excuse any longer. We will be judged by future generations if we, in full knowledge of the ecological price of current forest practices, continue to allow the destruction to continue. Governments of all political persuasions must take their conservation obligations seriously and now put in place the measures necessary to protect our irreplaceable forest heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I speak of forest conservation, I do not just mean the protection of trees. A forest is made up of complex interconnected life forms and processes. In turn, these forest ecosystems are an integral part of wider complex ecosystems. It is vital that we recognise that this complexity is what is irretrievably lost when we clearfell areas of forest. Trees can be regrown, as many people in the forest industry remind us, but clearfelled forest is lost for ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also see that that complex ecosystem is intimately interconnected with the wellbeing of people in this country in rainfall patterns, salinity patterns, and many other areas of interaction of which we are not at present aware. This government can no longer play with words in regard to forest protection. As is often the case, government action has simply not matched its rhetoric on forest conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Australia signed the convention on biodiversity at Rio in June 1992, we recognised that all species have an intrinsic right to exist independently of their value to humanity. We also acknowledged the need to ensure that the use of our environment did not lead to the long-term decline of biodiversity. This is reflected to some extent in the Endangered Species Protection Act of 1992. The objective of this act is to promote the recovery of species that are endangered or vulnerable and to prevent other species from becoming endangered on Commonwealth land or as a result of Commonwealth activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lip-service was paid to these concerns by imposing conditions on woodchip export licences, such that exporters were required to ensure that their activities did not threaten with extinction or impede the recovery of species listed federally as endangered. However, the federal government does not monitor compliance with these conditions and relies on state agencies. There is also considerable doubt as to whether these agencies themselves actually monitor to ensure compliance with the conditions, and certainly no formal reporting mechanism exists to inform the Commonwealth of this. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, this protection, such as it is, only applies to species actually listed on the federal endangered schedule. Species not on this schedule but listed as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, or species that are on Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management's reserve list, are not protected by this process. Nor is this protection extended by those acts to species only listed federally as vulnerable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, pre-logging surveys of flora and fauna are not routinely conducted. It is widely acknowledged, including by the federal government, that less is known of the biodiversity of Western Australia's south-west forests than of forests elsewhere in Australia. We do know that there is only one per cent of forest left in Western Australia in contrast to the two per cent of the state that was a unique forest system 200 years ago at the time of European settlement. Despite this, the federal government has issued woodchip export licences for these very forests. How can the government know whether species will be threatened with extinction when it does not know whether endangered species are present?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Endangered Species Protection Act any Commonwealth decision, action or approval that is critical to the survival or recovery of endangered species should trigger the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act of 1974. Given this, each woodchip export licence renewal or increase in licensed tonnage should, in reality, either be subject to environmental impact assessment or, at the very least, result in the reappraisal of the original impact assessment conducted when in-principle approval for woodchipping was given to relevant timber companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not one acknowledges that forests have a value separate from their value to people, it is still hard to argue the ethics of felling trees that were here hundreds of years before Europeans first invaded this country or of destroying forest ecosystems that have evolved over hundreds of thousands of years. At the native forest network conference held in Melbourne recently indigenous people spoke of their spiritual and cultural connections with the forests. Ian Hunter of the Yarra Yarra people of the Wurundjuri said that when forests are felled the spirit of the forests goes into the ground and they do not know how to draw the spirit back out of the land. Robert Thorpe of Gunai nation said that there was a strong spiritual link between indigenous people and the land and the animals and that when one dies the other dies. In clear felling forests, we are continuing the dispossession of Aboriginal people begun over 200 years ago. According to Elizabeth Hoffman of the Yorta Yorta people and Betty King of the Kerrup Jmara tribe, we need to listen to and learn from Aboriginal people if we are to heal this land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention on biological diversity, the intergovernmental agreement on the environment and the national forest policy statement&mdash;the government's so-called blueprint for forest conservation&mdash;all stressed the need to follow the precautionary principle in relation to environmental protection. In brief, this principle states that lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for postponing measures to avoid or minimise threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage. The government seems to be taking precautions with everything but environmental protection. There are alternative sources of wood products and pulp for paper. Plantations and agroforestry are already supplying much of Australia's domestic needs and studies show that there is enough plantation timber to begin the transition now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the government has a responsibility to make clear to industry a change in political will that reverses the previous position that logging of our high conservation value forests and our old-growth forests is acceptable at a price. It should be at no price, and I think the testimony of the people at the forest embassy is to be commended, encouraged and heeded by this federal government, as with all other governments around Australia at this point in history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and the Arts, upon notice, on 7 June 1994:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) On what grounds did the Australian Broadcasting Authority (ABA) conclude that the following acquisitions by foreign companies of financial interests in Australian television companies were consistent with 57(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, which prohibits a foreign person from being `in a position to exercise control of a TV licence': (a) the purchase by CanWest Global Communications of a 57.5 per cent financial interest in the Ten Network in the form of subordinated debentures, some of which can be converted to shares; (b) the purchase by Century Communications Corporation of a 95 per cent interest in UCOM Pay-TV Pty Ltd, holder of satellite television licence A, most of which is a non-voting shareholding instrument and deferred debt; and (c) the purchase by Lenfest Communications Inc. of a 63 per cent stake in New World Communications, holder of satellite pay television licence B, mostly in the form of debentures, which may fall to 29 per cent as further capital is raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Is it a fact that all three deals were designed to provide the foreign companies involved effective control of the television companies in which they acquired interests, while keeping their shareholdings under the 15 per cent limit set by section 57(2) of the Act; if not, why did the companies keep their shareholding levels so far below their financial interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Is the Minister aware that the term `to CanWest' is now used by media lawyers to describe company structures which deliver control while avoiding Australia's foreign ownership restrictions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) For each of the acquisitions referred to in (1), was Foreign Investment Review Board advice sought by or given to the ABA; if so, what was that advice.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMullan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) (a) CanWest Global Communications Corporation has a direct shareholding of 15% in The Ten Group Ltd.(`TEN'). This shareholding confers a 15% voting interest by CanWest in TEN. When this is added to the subordinated debenture arrangement, CanWest has a total economic interest of 57.5% in Ten.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated by the Australian Broadcasting Authority's (ABA's) Chairman, Brian Johns, to the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership of Print Media on 11 February 1994, the ABA's view is that these arrangements comply with the foreign ownership terms of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (BSA).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Brian Johns also indicated to the Committee that the issue could not be looked at in isolation and needed to be considered in the context of the wider control provisions of the BSA. Those provisions require the ABA to determine the proportions of so-called `deemed' and `actual' control. In terms of actual control the ABA considers other factors such as the composition, expertise and experience level of the company's board of directors, whether anyone has the right to veto decisions by the board, programming arrangements, management arrangements, and so on.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA, in accordance with the BSA, exercises a continuous interest in, and monitoring of, this situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) &amp; (c) Subsection 57(1) of the BSA prohibits foreign persons from being in a position to exercise control of commercial television broadcasting licences. Subsection 57(1) does not apply to subscription television broadcasting licences allocated under section 93 of the Act. Section 109 deals with foreign ownership limits for subscription television broadcasting licences. It provides that a foreign person must not have company interests of more than 20% in a subscription television broadcasting licence. Further, it provides that a foreign person must not have company interests in a subscription television broadcasting licence that, when added to the company interests in that licence held by other foreign persons, exceed 35%.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An important difference between subsection 57(1) and section 109 is that while the former is concerned with control by a foreign person, the latter is concerned with the company interests held by foreign persons. Section 6 of the Act defines `company interests' as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"`company interests', in relation to a person who has a shareholding interest, a voting interest, a dividend interest or a winding-up interest in a company, means the percentage of that interest or, if the person has 2 or more of those interests, whichever of those interests has the greater or greatest percentage".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA, as part of the process of allocating satellite subscription broadcasting licences A and B, investigated the issue of company interests held by foreign persons in the subscription television broadcasting licences. The ABA was satisfied that the limits set down in section 109 were not exceeded. In allocating these licences the ABA expressed the view that it would continue to monitor the ownership structures of the licensee companies. The ABA publicly reported on its investigations in relation to the allocation of Licence A on 14 February 1994, and on Licence B on 17 December 1993. The ABA is closely monitoring the foreign ownership of these licences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of section 109 provide scope for foreign participation necessary for the establishment of a viable pay TV industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The ABA is continuing to monitor the CanWest investment in the TEN network. With regard to the subscription television broadcasting licensees, there is no proscription within the Act that prevents foreign persons controlling the licences. The only proscription relating to foreign persons are those set down in section 109 of the Act relating to company interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Question (1) above makes it clear that the ABA's view is that Canwest has complied with the ownership and control requirements of the broadcasting legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Chairman of the ABA, in evidence to the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership of Print Media on 11 February 1994, advised that the only liaison between the ABA and FIRB relating to television did concern CanWest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">FIRB wrote to the ABA seeking advice on whether CanWest exerts influence over Oltec (now The Ten Group Ltd) greater than its 14.9 per cent shareholding would suggest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its response, the ABA contrasted FIRB's approach with the requirements of the BSA. The BSA requires that foreign company interest limits and control are to be treated separately. In assessing a potential breach of the BSA, the ABA considers compliance with the foreign company interest limits, and, given CanWest's 14.9 per cent company interest, whether CanWest exercises actual control over TEN. The ABA indicated that the concept of "control" is a concept not admitting of degree, and that the ABA was satisfied that CanWest was not in control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABA also indicated that it has no role in approving transactions involving commercial broadcasting licences before or after the event; rather, the ABA's role is an ongoing role of monitoring whether foreign persons are or come to be in a position to exercise control of a commercial television licence through transaction or otherwise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Minister does not propose to take any action. See answers to questions (1) and (2) above. However, he will continue to ensure the ABA monitors the issue closely.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Sex Discrimination and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1992 introduced significant reforms to the sexual harassment provisions in the Sex Discrimination Act 1984. The amendments, which became operative on 13 January 1993, redefine sexual harassment and expand the areas of public life where it is unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 28F(2) now makes it unlawful for an "adult" student (aged 16 years and over) to sexually harass another adult student or a member of staff of an educational institution. An "educational institution" is defined to mean a school, college, university or other institution at which education or training is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to promote awareness of these new provisions, a national information campaign for students and education institutions was commenced in the 1993/94 financial year. The objectives of the campaign are to:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to address sexual harassment in schools is supported by the findings of two recent reports&mdash;Listening to Girls, which was commissioned by the Australian Education Council and involved interviews with over 800 school girls around the country, and Sticks and Stones, Report of the Inquiry into Violence in Australian Schools. Both reports document the disturbing incidence of sexual and sex-based harassment experienced by many school girls as part of their day to day routine.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also considered appropriate to target sexual harassment in schools this year, as the National Action Plan for the Education of Girls makes the elimination of sex-based harassment a priority area for 1994.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Sales tax is paid on the hot water tank of a solar hot water system. This is because the tank has been regarded as a device for storage of water rather than the collection of solar energy. Where a hot water system incorporates a solar collector as part of a single unit, there is a sales tax exemption for that part of the sales value of the complete unit which applies to the solar panel and other necessary equipment such as differential pumps. In most hot water systems the sales tax would only be around 5-6 per cent of the solar system cost. The government is aware of this anomaly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I have asked my department to look into this anomaly and I am currently in the process of writing to the Treasurer about it. I will be suggesting that the entire solar hot water system should be sales tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Solar energy equipment, which is defined as equipment used for collecting, absorbing or concentrating the sun's rays for the purpose of using them as a source of heat and photovoltaic cells, is currently sales tax exempt. Ancillary equipment used to assist solar energy equipment is also exempt. Where the main purpose of the equipment is not to use solar energy, such as a `solar' pool blanket (an insulating device) or a solar powered watch, the equipment is not tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where windmills and hydro systems are used to generate electricity for domestic consumption, they are normally sales tax exempt under the exemption for equipment used for generating electricity in residential premises. If the wind or hydro systems are used for commercial electricity production then they are sales tax exempt as they would be classified as manufacturing systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not considering widening sales tax exemption for renewable energy equipment except, as noted in part 2 of my response to your question, for the tanks of solar hot water systems. This is because where the type of equipment is clearly for renewable energy production, it is in general already tax exempt. In the few cases where sales tax is paid, the sales tax is only a small percentage of the final price of the system. It would produce administrative problems for the taxation department to widen the exemption without leading to any significant reduction in the price of equipment to the public.</PARA>
