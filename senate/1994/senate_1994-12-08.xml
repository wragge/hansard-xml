<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XE4">Senator Bolkus</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) It was, and remains, the intention to prescribe new financial products which will be subject to a regulatory framework which will protect investors using appropriate provisions of Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 of the Corporations Law. Each new product proposed under these provisions would be dealt with on a case by case basis according to its risk profile to ensure that the regulatory framework governing the product provided adequate investor protection. The provisions referred to will, facilitate the trading of new and innovative products on Australian securities and futures exchanges and, in particular, the trading of a new product (termed a `share ratio contract') by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) As above. The revised provisions of the draft Corporations Law Amendment Bill 1994, which had been released for public exposure on 5 September 1994, are largely the same as those that appear in the Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill 1994, which has now been introduced in this session.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The role of the National Guarantee Fund (NGF) is not to provide comprehensive cover in respect of any default of the type addressed by this question. In the context of share ratio contracts, I am advised that the relevant NGF provisions are contained in section 954N of the Corporations Law which allows a claim to be made on the NGF if a broker defaults in meeting a net payment obligation in the settlement system. The NGF is not, as suggested by the question, confined to the coverage of share trading. I am advised that claims against the NGF can be made in respect of other equity derivatives such as options traded on the ASX and its subsidiaries as well as in respect of property entrusted to broker who subsequently becomes insolvent, loss arising from either an unauthorised transfer of securities or from the failure to comply with the certificate cancellation procedures and a range of contract guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) and (5) Under the Corporations Law, claims against the NGF may be made in a range of circumstances. I am advised, however, that the coverage of the NGF is not so broad as to encompass `any default to the Australian Stock Exchange or the Options Clearing House'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is intended that the NGF will similarly cover claims in relation to the trading of share ratio contracts which could arise through the insolvency of a broker or through the failure of a member of the ASX to meet net payment obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Securities Exchange Guarantee Corporation (SEGC) is responsible for the operation of the NGF and the assessment of claims against it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the SEGC commissioned a firm of actuaries to conduct an independent actuarial analysis of the potential exposure of the NGF to trading in share ratio contracts. I am advised that the analysis was conducted by Tillinghast (previously Trowbridge Tillinghast) which is a subsidiary of Towers Perrin, one of the leading actuarial companies in the world. It is worth noting that Trowbridge Tillinghast undertook a review for the Sydney Futures Exchange to examine and make recommendations on the adequacy of the financial backing of the Sydney Futures Exchange Clearing House and the Sydney Futures Exchange Fidelity Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The findings of the analysis of the NGF's exposure are that "the introduction of share ratio contracts would not lead to a serious undermining of the financial resources of the NGF". The report was based on information provided by the SEGC and it is assumed that share ratio contracts will only be written on major Australian companies. Tillinghast are of the opinion that under normal circumstances it is unlikely that the transaction of business in share ratio contracts would lead to claims on the NGF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that studies in relation to the NGF have also been conducted at various times by the Board of the SEGC and that, in accordance with its statutory mandate, the Board regularly monitors the risk exposure of the NGF and reviews the minimum amount of the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before prescribing any product under the proposed provisions, I would seek the advice of the ASC and the SEGC on issues such as the adequacy and coverage of the NGF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In light of the report by Tillinghast, which did not conclude that more capital was required to support the operations of the stock market, the options market and the proposed products, no response to this question is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The basis of this question is that additional capital may be required, but the report by Tillinghast concluded otherwise. However, measures to protect investors in the share market and the equity derivative market are set out in the Corporations Law (primarily in Chapters 7 and 8), the Corporations Regulations and the Australian Stock Exchange Business and Listing Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the trading of share ratio contracts those measures will include:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> the application of the Chapter 8 provisions dealing with futures market manipulation, false trading and market rigging (ss 1259 and 1260)</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> a requirement for information to be provided to an individual about the financial ramifications involved in a share ratio contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further specific rules to govern the trading of share ratio contracts will be set out in amendments to the Corporations Regulations and the ASX Business Rules. For example, the ASX proposes to use their existing derivatives clearing and that clearing house is supported by an efficient margining system known as the Theoretical Intermarket Margining System (TIMS) which provides for daily margining of positions in the market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As stated in (5), the Board of the SEGC regularly monitors the risk exposure of the NGF and reviews the minimum amount of the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) I am advised that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the financial backing of the Sydney Futures Exchange Clearing House to guarantee the operations of the futures market is $100 million; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) that the SFE Fidelity Fund according to the last reported accounts stands at $11.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) As set out in (4) and (5) the NGF provides a mechanism to protect the interests of investors in share ratio contracts. I am advised that the NGF stood at $126.3 million with current liabilities of $425,000 as at 30 June 1994. Where the amount of the Fund is less than the `minimum amount' (currently determined to be $50 million) the SEGC may determine that a levy is payable on certain transactions or by the Australian Stock Exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that under the relevant contract guarantee provisions of the NGF (Part 7.10 of the Corporations Law) there would be no limit on the payment of successful claims under Division 6B of Part 7.10 in relation to share ratio contracts and the total amount of the Fund is available to meet any claims.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the NGF will also compensate, in particular circumstances, investors who suffer loss of money or property held by an ASX member as a result of the Member becoming insolvent (Division 8 of Part 7.10). I am advised that there is a limit in respect of the total amount that will be paid out of the NGF in respect of any one member's insolvency. I am advised that the current limit is $7 million. In addition to the coverage afforded by the NGF the ASX Options Clearing House would ordinarily have available funds which include margin and deposit funds.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that brokers are required under ASX Business Rules to maintain professional indemnity cover for claims arising from fraud or defalcation in relation to monies or property lodged with brokers. I also note that ASX Business Rule 1.1 which is monitored by the ASX requires that brokers always have sufficient liquid capital to meet their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) I am advised that the NGF provisions of the Corporations Law do not provide for the separation of funds available in relation to fraud and defalcations or in respect of share market and options trading activities. It is not proposed that the NGF have separate funds available for separate products. I am advised by the ASC that segregation of funds should not be necessary, if the total amount of the NGF advised by Tillinghast is adequate, or greater than required, to cover the reasonably foreseeable exposures in relation to share contracts and securities .</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) I am advised by the ASC that, given the size of the NGF and the arrangements for risk management practices by the ASX and the Options Clearing House, including the assessment and calling for margins, investors should not be unduly exposed to risks in relation to investment products which cannot be met from the NGF.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) It is intended that the Corporations Regulations will provide that dealings in, or the provision of advice on, share ratio contracts will be restricted to members of the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX), who are also members of the Options Clearing House (OCH), and other persons whose dealers licence expressly allows dealings in, or the giving of advice on, share ratio contracts. It is proposed that the ASX Business Rules applying to share ratio products will restrict ASX members to dealing or advising clients through employees who had met requirements in the Business Rules and had satisfied the Board of the ASX as to their knowledge and experience in trading and advising on share ratio contracts. Those Business Rules are examined by the ASC and they are also subject to review and possible disallowance by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to persons who are not members of the ASX and who wish to trade share ratio contracts I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) would impose conditions on the licence of such persons requiring a standard of education and knowledge similar to that required by the ASX.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) It is possible, though unlikely, that a licensed dealer trading share ratio products would not be a member of the ASX so long as the ASC has approved that person for trading in share ratio products. In deciding whether a person should be allowed to deal in share ratio contracts I would expect that the ASC would take into account whether that person is a member of a self-regulatory organisation such as the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Licensed dealers will not necessarily be required to be a member of a self regulatory organisation. Also see (3) and (5) above.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7)(a) In relation to representatives of ASX, members dealing in, or advising on, share ratio contracts will be required to satisfy the standards set by the ASX in consultation with the ASC as to their level of expertise, probity, financial backing and trading procedures and be approved as an `Approved Ratio Adviser'. These requirements will be set out in the ASX Business Rules. The Business Rules will be examined by the ASC and will also be subject to review and possible disallowance by the Attorney-General.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised the ASX proposes that Approved Ratio Advisers must attend an ASX conducted training program, study a range of literature produced by ASX, sign a formal undertaking and be subject to supervision by a senior representative of the broker with experience to the satisfaction of ASC in equity derivatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program contemplated by ASX differs from Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) procedures in that SFE Registered Representatives must pass a formal examination and attend a longer training course. However, I am advised that the requirements are similar to those prescribed by the SFE for holders of a proper authority granted by the holder of a securities dealers licence seeking authority to advise in individual stock futures traded on the SFE.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)(i) The Business Rules of ASX impose stringent capital adequacy requirements which take into account all transactions on the account of a broker including activities in the share market and equity derivatives markets.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii) ASX Members have been trading deliverable and cash settled equity derivatives since 1976. I am advised that the margining, reporting and settlement procedures already in place are appropriate to share ratio contracts. ASX through OCH, the subsidiary through which equity derivatives are cleared, recently introduced a new risk management system&mdash;TIMS, an acronym for Theoretical Inter Market Margining System. TIMS is a system for margining derivative contracts which was developed by the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) of Chicago. TIMS is acknowledged as an advanced and appropriate system for the risk management of equity derivatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The procedures and systems outlined in question (7) will apply to all members of the ASX proposing to trade share ratio contracts. Non-members of the ASX will be required to satisfy the ASC in relation to similar requirements before they can trade share ratio contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) I am advised that persons who are not members of the ASX or persons whose dealers licences do not expressly allow dealings in, or the giving of advice on, share ratio contracts will not be allowed to so deal or advise. Before such a person would be approved by the ASC to trade share ratio contracts they will be required to meet similar requirements to those referred to in (7).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to OCH, all such orders must be put through the market, so that a clearing member of OCH takes responsibility for that order. Section 851 of the Corporations Law also requires that a securities adviser have a reasonable basis for a securities recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) I am advised by the ASC that it considers that the introduction of trading of share ratios does not appear to raise any new or specific problems for the ASC or ASX's existing surveillance and enforcement program. Staff of the ASX have extensive experience of leveraged financial derivatives with risk profiles similar to futures contracts and have conducted and regulated derivatives markets in Australia since 1976. I am advised that the ASX have surveillance systems in place to maintain the integrity and stability of the markets for which it is responsible and that the ASX Surveillance Division liaises closely with the OCH on activity in the physical and derivatives markets. I also understand that the ASX has conducted a review of surveillance procedures to ensure that the type of market abuses and potential risks involved in equity derivatives and futures trading are understood.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the ASX surveillance is based on the SOMA (Surveillance of Market Activity) computer program.

These alerts are then addressed in real-time by market analysts specialising in surveillance matters. Where warranted an investigation is commenced.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) I am advised by the ASC that the regulatory package for the trading of share ratios contract is appropriate to protect the investing public.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12)(a) and (b) I am aware that there are detailed licensing regimes in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 of the Corporations Law. The detailed requirements of the licensing regimes in Chapter 7 and Chapter 8 differ and judgments may be made about their respective merits. However both licensing regimes are capable of providing an appropriate regulatory framework for the trading of derivative products such as share ratio and options contracts. The ASC imposes as a prerequisite for obtaining a stock brokers licence that the applicant must be a member of a self-regulatory stock exchange organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisions of the draft Corporations Law (Securities and Futures) Amendment Bill 1994 only permit the prescription of products which are relevant agreements entered into on the markets of futures exchanges or securities exchanges. The Corporations Regulations will prescribe a particular type of instrument. The effect of the prescription will be that an instrument can only be traded on a securities market of a securities exchange if it is to be dealt with under the regulatory regime set up by the legislation, the regulations and the proposed business rules.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The necessary effect of that restriction is that only members of securities exchanges may enter into share ratio agreements on the securities exchanges. Securities exchanges, in particular Australian Stock Exchange Limited, have extensive and specialised compliance and financial requirements which are imposed upon members of the exchange as a consequence of membership. Those rules are designed to ensure the financial stability and integrity of the market operated by ASX, and of members themselves. Accordingly, in the context of the proposed share ratios market, securities dealers who engage in trading in the market will be subject to similar extensive and specialised compliance and financial requirements to those established by Sydney Futures Exchange in relation to futures brokers. Indeed, in the view of the ASC, the requirements imposed by means of the proposed ASX Business Rules will be appropriate for the trading in share ratio contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">12(c) and (d) I am aware of these matters which were the reason for the introduction of the Futures Industry Code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">12(e) and (f) Yes I am aware. Requirements similar to those for futures brokers exist for holders of stock brokers licences and these requirements are enforced by both the ASC and the ASX.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is correct to state that a futures broker's licence is required, by any person who deals in a futures contract on another persons behalf (sll42(a) Corporations Law), whereas a securities dealer's licence is required where a person carries on a securities business (s780(a) Corporations Law). As noted in the explanatory memorandum for the Futures Industry Bill 1986, the futures licensing system is similar to that which was operating under the Securities Industry Act. The inclusion of a specific requirement on futures brokers to be licensed, as a condition of dealing on behalf of another person, is the major difference. As is made clear by the explanatory memorandum (paragraphs 149, 150, 276&mdash;279), and also by the explanatory paper on the second exposure draft of the Futures Industry Bill 1985 (paragraphs 175-179, 324-328), the main purpose of the difference was to prohibit the practice of `bucketing' where orders of a client are not placed for execution on the relevant futures market. Rather, the broker either takes the other side of the transaction or matches it with equal and opposite orders from other clients. The effect of this is that clients do not obtain the benefits of clearing house arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that this concern does not arise in the proposed market for share ratio contracts, since the regulatory regime to be set up by the draft provisions can only apply in relation to contracts entered into on a stock market of a securities exchange. This ensures that parties to those contracts have the benefit of the Clearing House arrangements set up for the Australian Options Market, and also the benefit of National Guarantee Fund protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the requirement for securities licensing where a person carries on a securities business, is in fact more extensive than the requirement to be licensed only when acting on behalf of other persons. "Securities business" is broadly defined (in s93) as a business of dealing in securities. In turn, "dealing" is defined to include a wide range of activity in relation to securities, including attempting or inducing a person to make or to offer to make an agreement in relation to the acquisition, disposal, subscription for or underwriting of securities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, securities licensing is required for a wide range of persons who, in the futures context, would not require futures brokers' licences because they do not act on behalf of any other person.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(g) and (h) An investment adviser's licence empowers a person to carry on a business of advising other persons about securities, or publishing securities reports (s77 Corporations Law). As soon as the activities of the investment adviser fall within the very broad definition of `dealing'&mdash;that is, buying, selling, attempting or inducing other persons to make agreements about buying, selling and so on then a securities dealer's licence is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A regulation will be made preventing the giving of advice for dealing in share ratios unless the adviser or dealer has satisfied the ASC as to its expertise and education in relation to share ratios. In addition, only ASX members will be allowed to execute orders for share ratios and ASX members will be required to have a client agreement form signed by the client and an approved ratio assigned to the client before orders may be executed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) The responses to the matters raised in (12) make it clear that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> in the context of the proposed share ratios market, the combined effect of securities dealers' licensing arrangements and the specialised compliance and financial requirements established by the ASX for those able to deal in share ratio contracts have the effect that the operation of the compliance system for the proposed share ratio market is no less onerous than futures brokers licensing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">to the extent that securities dealers licensing is required wherever a securities business is carried on, regardless of whether dealing is conducted on behalf of others or not, the licence requirements under Chapter 7 can be considered more onerous than under Chapter 8, because of their wider application.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) It is proposed that investment advisers may only pass on client orders in relation to share ratio contracts where they have a securities dealers licence and their licence has been endorsed by the ASC to advise on or deal in share ratios.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) The provisions referred to will not be applicable to the trading of share ratio contracts.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3)(a) I am advised that share ratio contracts will be traded on the Australian Stock Exchange's (ASX's) market through its Securities Exchange Automated Trading System (SEATS) and cleared and settled through the ASX's Options Clearing House (OCH).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the Australian Securities Commission (ASC) is working with the ASX to ensure that the provisions of the Business Rules relating to the clearing of share ratio contracts by the OCH are appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that the ASX has adopted the Chicago Mercantile Exchange developed risk management margining system known as TIMS (Theoretical Intermarket Margining System) which allows both end of day and intra day margining of ASX's clearing house members and, through them, their clients. I am advised that the greater speed of calculation of risk and prudent margins of TIMS significantly lowers the risk of individual market participant failure to which a derivatives market is exposed and therefore the systemic risk to the market. The share ratio Business Rules will create a special category of SEATS operators who will be authorised by their clearing member employers to trade in share ratio contracts on SEATS. The operators will be required to undergo special training and will be specially accredited.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) I am advised that clearing members will be required to register share ratio contracts with OCH after trade. By virtue of an electronic interface between SEATS and OCH, registration will occur electronically immediately after the bid and offer are matched on the SEATS screen. I am advised that the share ratio Business Rules will provide that on registration of the share ratio contract, the buying and selling side to the contract will be split apart by novation, the original contract being replaced by two contracts. By the first contract the seller sells to OCH and by the second contract the buyer buys from OCH. This is the typical arrangement in options and futures markets and indeed with the advent of the T + 5 settlement regime, in the ASX equities market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that under the Business Rules the buyer and seller on registration will be subject to the disciplines of OCH' s margining system. It is mandatory to pay risk margins in respect of open contractual positions. TIMS calculates a risk margin that is the most likely overnight adverse movement in the value of the Share Ratio contract and is the amount the liquidating value of a Share Ratio contract would change in a worst case scenario overnight. This margining process will be repeated daily for the risk margins in addition to the `mark to market' process dealt with below. With TIMS in place, if there is significant `intra-day market movement', margin calls for payment may be made during the course of that day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once the contract is registered the buying and selling clearing members open `bought' and `sold' positions will be marked to market daily. The clearing members' positions in Share Ratios will be assessed daily in accordance with movements in the market. An assessment of profits or losses on those positions will be made in line with that market movement and will be posted to the relevant account of the clearing member as with option contracts. As a result of this process OCH calculates the daily amount owing on each account (separate and in addition to risk margins) and the clearing member will be required to pay the amount owing to OCH.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) I am advised that experienced risk management staff of the ASX monitor the market and use TIMS. The daily margining processes are a common feature of risk management procedures for derivatives, futures contracts or otherwise.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The legislation has been designed to facilitate the trading of new products developed by the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX) and the Sydney Futures Exchange (SFE) on securities and futures exchanges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed amendments are designed to provide an interim flexible regime for the development of innovative financial products by ensuring that a tailored and appropriate regulatory regime applies for each new product. Of necessity, therefore, the proposed arrangements are designed to deal with products the existence of which has not yet been anticipated in a flexible way by use of regulations and business rules where appropriate. Bearing in mind the current examination of derivatives by the Corporations and Securities Advisory Committee, the Attorney-General has indicated that it is not expected that any products other than the proposed share ratios product are likely to be brought forward under the new provisions at this time. However, any futures or securities exchange which can demonstrate a new product requiring the application of the legislation will be able to make submissions to the Attorney General seeking prescription under the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While they introduce more flexibility into the trading of new products on an exchange it will be necessary for an exchange seeking the benefits of the legislation to demonstrate that the features of the relevant product are appropriate for the relevant prescription and that satisfactory investor protection is in place.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Government policy to assist the Australian securities and futures industries to grow and develop. These industries are significant to Australia's future as a mature and stable economy and through these industries Australia can develop as an important financial centre in the Asia-Pacific region. The existing Australian exchanges hold key positions in these industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government recognises that the future success of the exchanges depends in part on their capacity to develop innovative new products. Both the ASX and the Sydney Futures Exchange have shown that they have the capacity to do this and that they wish to go further. It is important that this activity is not inhibited by uncertainty as to the classification of derivative products under the Corporations Law and regulatory structures which may encourage business to go elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of this the Government has decided to amend the Corporations Law to introduce more flexibility into the definitions of `securities' and `futures contracts'. The Government accepts that the present definitions can operate to prevent the trading of a new product on a particular exchange, even though there may be valid reasons why it should be able to trade on that exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criteria of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) of the United States is one factor that has been taken into account in the development of the Government's proposals in relation to the trading of new derivative products. However, it is noted that the CFTC and the Securities Exchange Commission have agreed previously to prohibit futures contracts over individual shares. I understand that that decision was based on the difficulty of accommodating those instruments under that current futures or securities legislation, whereas, in Australia individual share futures are permitted and are currently traded on the SFE. The Government believes that a more flexible approach to regulation of financial products is in the best interests of all participants in the finance industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(f) In its Report on OTC Derivatives Markets the ASC recommended that law reform in the equity derivatives area should have as its first objective `to ensure similar regulatory treatment of products with similar function or characteristics'. The Report also made suggestions regarding the criteria which should guide the proposed regulation-making power and emphasised that the power should be used in relation to products that have the function or characteristics of products caught by the existing definitions. In the ASC's view, policy should be driven by functional rather than legal analysis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation of share ratio contracts via the Corporations Law, prescribed regulations and ASX Business Rules will meet this criteria. It fulfils the very objective set out by the ASC in its Report and the ASC agrees with the Government's flexible approach in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) A share ratio contract does not fall within the existing definition of securities. However, there is a close relationship between a share ratio contract and securities which are already traded on the ASX. Share ratio contracts require a knowledge of the performance of individual shares. I am advised that stockbrokers are equipped to provide advice about the performance of shares and with the proposed special requirements for licensing of trading in share ratios will be equipped to advise on such contracts. The Government is, acting on the advice of the ASC, of the view, therefore, that in this particular case it is reasonable for share ratio contracts to be traded on a securities exchange.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) Financial markets and the needs of their users are evolving in ways that were not envisaged during the 1980s. New and innovative products continue to be developed and traded by derivatives markets. In putting forward these reforms the Government is simply responding to a request by an exchange to facilitate the trading of a particular product. The Australian Securities Commission supports the introduction of some flexibility into the legislative regime applying to the securities and futures to deal with emergency issues in changing market circumstances. Similar requests may be made in the future, although none have been proposed to date. Provided adequate safeguards are in place to ensure the protection of investors and the integrity of markets Governments must be able to respond to such requests and the needs of the users of financial markets. The Bill provides a mechanism for responding to such requests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The flexibility will enable, where appropriate, the trading of new products on a particular exchange in circumstances where there are valid reasons why such products should be so traded but are obstructed by the existing definitions of `securities' and `futures contracts'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) and (10) See (7). It has been recognised that the existing provisions of the Corporations Law could restrict derivative product development initiatives and may operate to inhibit the development of innovative new products. Share ratio contracts are but one example of this. It is for this reason and in recognition of the existing difficulties with the definitions of `securities' and of `futures contracts' that the Companies and Securities Advisory Committee is undertaking a review of the regulation of derivatives. The proposed legislation will attempt to provide some flexibility pending that review.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not suggested that there are any features of Chapter 8 which are necessarily inappropriate for regulation of the trading of share ratios. Rather, should the SFE choose to develop and trade a risk management product similar to share ratio contracts which is clearly a futures contract or Chapter 8 agreement, then the SFE could do so because the provisions of Chapter 8 are not inappropriate. There may be other appropriate regimes for trading such products and the proposed package for trading share ratios on the ASX is an example of this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(11) Each financial product must be considered on its own merits. The proposals of the Bill in relation to the particular product are not necessarily applicable to other futures contracts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that the background paper merely states that there is a close relationship between share ratio contracts and the underlying securities. There probably is a closer relationship between share ratio contracts and ASX's markets than many other commodities and their derivative markets because the underlying components of the derivative markets are created and traded on ASX's markets and by the ASX members who would trade share ratio contracts.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)&mdash;(3) I am advised that the question is not in a form which would make the provision of meaningful replies possible. For example, computer hardware comes in a number of forms and the costs range from small to very large amounts, depending on the hardware in question. It would not be possible, without an expenditure of resources which could not be justified, to extract records of minor purchases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, software may at one extreme be very inexpensive, and purchased over the counter, or at the other be very costly and acquired through major tender processes. Much software may not be purchased at all, in the sense of legal ownership transferring from the producer to the Commonwealth, even though there is Commonwealth expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department's Legal Office Information System (LOIS) is a large national wide area network system which integrates strategic software and hardware components which have varying degrees of reliability, costs, life spans and purpose.
