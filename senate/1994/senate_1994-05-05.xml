<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 will amend the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (the `SIS Act') and the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993. Those Acts formed the centrepiece of a package of superannuation legislation which received Royal Assent on 30 November 1993 and which gave effect to the new prudential arrangements for superannuation that the Treasurer announced on 21 October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill makes a number of amendments, many of a technical nature, to the abovementioned Acts aimed at further enhancing and refining the operation of those Acts. I now wish to provide an overview of the main amendments made by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allowing certain non-bank financial institutions to offer `approved guarantees'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the SIS Act to allow certain non-bank financial institutions to offer guarantees required under the SIS Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently only approved banks and the Commonwealth, States or Territories can offer the guarantees required under the SIS Act. Building societies, credit unions and similar organisations which are subject to supervision under the various State Financial Institutions Codes are considered to be institutions which should also be able to offer the guarantees required under the SIS Act and this bill amends the SIS Act accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allowing `in-house' investments in certain non-bank financial institutions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An `in-house asset' is essentially a loan to, or investment in, a standard employer sponsor of the fund (or an associate of such an employer sponsor) and the SIS Act places restrictions, for prudential reasons, on the level of such investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the SIS Act to treat deposits in certain non-bank financial institutions (which are subject to prudential supervision) in the same manner as deposits in an approved bank with regard to determining if they are `in-house assets'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applications for the issue of a superannuation interest and application to become a standard employer-sponsor</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the SIS Act to ensure that the trustee cannot accept a person as a member of a public offer entity unless that person has applied in the appropriate manner and has received relevant information (determined by the Commissioner) regarding the entity before doing so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Acquisition of certain assets from members of regulated superannuation funds</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SIS Act imposes a general prohibition on the acquisition of assets from members, subject to a limited exception in relation to funds with less than 5 members (excluded superannuation funds) provided the asset acquired is business real property. The bill amends the SIS Act to ensure that an excluded superannuation fund can only acquire business real property from a member (or relative of a member) if the property is business real property in the member's (or relative's) principal business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This ensures that the right balance is struck between allowing the acquisition of business real property from members of excluded funds and recognising the dangers (from a prudential, retirement incomes and taxation revenue perspective) in such an approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Public Offer Superannuation Funds and Equal Representation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SIS Act currently requires a standard employer sponsored fund which is a public offer fund to have an independent trustee. The bill amends the SIS Act to allow such funds the option of either having an independent trustee or having equal numbers of employer and member representatives involved in the trusteeship of the fund. This provides funds with greater flexibility in organising their trusteeship while at the same time ensuring that members are protected&mdash;in the first instance by having a trustee who is independent and in the second by having direct involvement in the fund via equal representation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Existing trustee may give notice of retirement</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fundamental principle of the SIS Act is that superannuation entities should be in the control of a single party (the trustees) who take full responsibility for the fund. However, the Corporations Law currently requires that superannuation entities which are public offer entities have dual responsible parties (the trustee and the management company). The SIS Act enables these public offer entities to change to have a single party in control of the fund. In many cases this will involve the trustee retiring and the management company taking over the role of trustee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effective and smooth operation of this changeover may be hampered if the existing trustee is required to hold a meeting of beneficiaries before retiring (as the governing rules of some superannuation entities may require). To overcome this problem, and therefore to ensure a smooth changeover, the bill amends the SIS Act to provide that such a requirement in the governing rules of a fund has no effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secrecy Provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the SIS Act to allow the Minister to approve disclosure of protected information (if it is in the public interest to do so) to the public at large, rather than just to particular members of the public. At the same time the bill amends the SIS Act to ensure that appropriate protection is provided to an individual by only allowing disclosure of information that relates to the private affairs of an individual where such disclosure would not be unreasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Approved purposes of, and payments to beneficiaries in, an approved deposit fund</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill amends the SIS Act to ensure consistency between related provisions in the Act which deal with the purposes for which an approved deposit fund may be maintained and payments to beneficiaries. This clarifies the existing obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disqualified persons not to be custodians</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The SIS Act currently restricts disqualified persons from being trustees or investment managers of superannuation entities. There is however no similar requirement on custodians. The bill amends the SIS Act to address this problem and ensure that custodians are subject to similar `eligibility' requirements to those applying to trustees and investment managers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Removal of trustees of public offer entities</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill inserts a new requirement into the SIS Act to prevent another party from trying to exert undue influence on a trustee by threatening to remove the trustee unless the trustee complies with that party's requests. The amendment ensures that no other party would have the power to exercise such influence by ensuring that, unless the regulations provide otherwise, no person (other than the Commissioner) can remove a trustee of a public offer entity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other provisions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More detailed information on the amendments made by this bill and an explanation of those amendments is contained in the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments made by this bill have no revenue implications.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 (the Principal Act).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of my private members bill is to correct an existing sales tax anomaly. The effect of the anomaly is that two wheel drive vehicles attract sales tax of 21% whilst four wheel drive vehicles with the same body type and used for the same purposes are sales tax exempt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current laws primary producers are able to buy certain motor vehicles free of sales tax in two situations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the first situation, any kind of general purpose motor vehicle (except two wheel drive "luxury" vehicles) for use mainly in carrying out a primary production business can be purchased free of sales tax. Vehicles bought under this category must be used exclusively within the primary production premises [Item 2(3)(b) of the First Schedule of the Principal Act].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A farmer may decide to buy a two wheel drive utility that will be used mainly to carry fodder around the farm. However, if the farmer also intends to use the vehicle to collect agricultural goods from his supplier or to transport his family to school the farmer could not purchase the vehicle free of sales tax because it would not be for use exclusively on his primary production premises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, this exemption has only limited application in practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second situation arises under Item 3 of the First Schedule of the Principal Act. Item 3 sets out the types of motor vehicles which are exempt when purchased for use in carrying out activities in the agricultural industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only vehicles eligible for the exemption in this category are four wheel drive vehicles, with body type of jeep, platform, pick up or utility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision therefore excludes from exemption two wheel drive utilities including those manufactured by Ford and General Motors Holden in Australia. All four wheel drive vehicles falling within this exemption are fully imported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The exemption under item 3 has wide application and is not limited to primary producers. The exemption is also available to contractors engaged in harvesting, crop dusting, fertiliser spreading, fencing, droving and shearing, where the vehicles are purchased mainly for use in work related to agricultural activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It appears the restriction of the sales tax exemption to four wheel drive vehicles originated from the approach adopted by the Australian Taxation Office over the years that only four wheel drive vehicles contained specifications which categorised them especially suitable for use for agricultural purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a view is no longer tenable or appropriate. In keeping with competition and through the massive ongoing development programs to upgrade the quality and capacity of commercial vehicles, locally manufactured two wheel drive utilities produced by Ford in particular now have performance capabilities that equal most imported four wheel drive vehicles used in the agricultural industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principal Act should therefore be amended to extend the exemption to two wheel drive vehicles with body type of jeep, platform, pick up or utility. This involves amending Item 3 of the First Schedule as my private members bill seeks to do. The bill extends the exemption to all two wheel drive vehicles, with the appropriate body type, whether they are locally produced or not.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will make two wheel drive vehicles cheaper by several thousand dollars and more price competitive. The increase in demand would increase production and yield employment advantages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I urge all members of this Chamber to support this bill. I commend the bill for the consideration of this Chamber.</PARA>

<PARA>I wish to address briefly the arguments about the tabling of these documents. In February, I put on notice a question to the then Minister for Administrative Services, Senator McMullan, regarding some details of property leases in the Casselden Place building in Melbourne. The minister very kindly provided me with an answer recently giving some of the basic details relating to those leases, but he said that the details in relation to the rentals, the outgoings costs and the incentive packages paid to get those government agencies into the Casselden Place building were commercially confidential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information is important because the Casselden Place building in Melbourne is owned by the Commonwealth government, under Australian Estate Management, and the leases pertain to a number of DAS business agencies. I am interested in this matter because a number of those agencies have already received significant subsidies from the federal government under a program called the property adjustment program which was designed, according to government officers at estimates committee briefings recently, to ensure the smooth transition of government departmental agencies under DAS moving from being departmental functions to being commercialised bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a process that the opposition supports. We even support&mdash;at least I do, I cannot speak for the opposition&mdash;the idea of a property adjustment program to smooth the transition of those departmental functions into commercialised operations. Effectively, a number of those agencies did have uncommercial property holdings. It made it impossible for them to compete fairly if they were lumbered with the poor property decisions made in the past. An adjustment program is an important way of easing that transition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is my view that that program should not apply to agencies or government enterprises, the DAS commercial operations, that are entering into new leases. Clearly, in this case, $481,000 was paid to Australian Construction Services to go into Casselden Place. I think that is an abuse of the property adjustment program, based on the minister's and the department's advice on the objects of that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is quite important that the Australian taxpayer is aware of the dealings between one agency and another, particularly where an agency such as Australian Construction Services is now actively competing in a highly competitive marketplace. It is important that all taxpayers and the parliament know whether or not Australian Construction Services and other commercialised agencies of DAS do compete in a competitively and commercially neutral way. We cannot make a fair assessment about that if we are not sure of the cross-subsidies and potential subsidies that are being received by those commercial arms.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can see only one argument to support the commercial-in-confidence response that the minister gave me and that is that in a competitive office leasing market it could be seen to be prejudicial to the government's interests in leasing Casselden Place if the sorts of incentive packages that were being paid to other tenants were revealed. Senator Spindler referred to this yesterday when I talked to him informally about his support for my motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were informed by Australian Estate Management at this time yesterday that Casselden Place is about 87 per cent leased. That is an exceptionally good performance in a very tight office market. Even if the building was not leased at such a level, I still think the incentive packages could be revealed. As I said to Senator Spindler yesterday, in the property market things like incentive packages, leasing deals and so forth are generally available through the valuation profession. The tax department needs information about these details because they are often subject to capital gains tax; they are not a state secret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the overwhelming principle involved here is taxpayers' money. We are talking about the expenditure of taxpayers' money and, specifically, about a deal between one Commonwealth agency and another Commonwealth agency. When the Senate is not able to be properly informed about these matters, we are undermining the democracy and the accountability processes that are quite proper in this parliament. I urge the Senate to support my motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are not debating a new principle. We have been around this track several times before together with my views on the broad questions of principle involved. They are complex and Senator Campbell has referred to some of the elements in the balance. My comments are substantially on the Senate's record, and I will not take the Senate's time reiterating the broad questions of principle. I will go to the facts of the particular case before us and apply those principles as I have articulated them in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To facilitate the business of the Senate in dealing with this, I will table a letter addressed to me from the Minister for Administrative Services which, in essence, sets out his position on this matter and, in a sense, the brief on his behalf which I am arguing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: how is it that the businesses in question&mdash;in this instance the Australian Construction Services, Asset Services and Interiors&mdash;can compete equally with the private sector, which we require them to do, and should require them to do, when they have to make information available to their competitors which their competitors do not have to provide to them? It is a step further along the track from that stage in the past where we said that the property leasing agency was at a disadvantage if it had to disclose its lease deals. That is a clearer example and that would have been the case in the earlier stages of consideration of these contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, essentially, although Australian Estate Management would not be happy about the details being disclosed, it has concluded its business in this matter, although it will have to do a lot of other business in Melbourne and in this building. We have gone past that now. It is now a question of the competitive advantage given to the competitors of ACS, Asset Services and Interiors. All of them are out there in the marketplace competing; all of them are finding it tough. That is the nature of the property market in Australia, particularly in Melbourne, and their competitors are finding it tough too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister continues strongly to take the view that it is contrary to the public interest to reveal commercial-in-confidence information with regard to DAS businesses, and he is strongly of the view that he should not provide such information to the Senate. He also acknowledges the legitimate interest of senators, and it is a difficult balance to strike. He has said in the letter which I will table later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, I can say in this particular case that the rents were determined on a market related basis without commercial incentives.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is an important matter to put on the record. One of the concerns is: is there a particular incentive package? Without going into the details of what the outcome was, the answer is no, there was not on this occasion. I understand that people want to know that, and that is the answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As senators will see reflected in the letter, the minister stated that if Senator Campbell would like some information on the range of rents and the average outgoings being paid by these businesses, the minister would be happy to furnish this information to him on his undertaking to respect the confidentiality of the information. The minister further states that he understands Senator Campbell's real agenda&mdash;not in any way a hidden agenda&mdash;is to look at whether the property adjustment program has been properly applied. The minister would be happy to discuss this matter with Senator Campbell as soon as Senator Campbell wants to approach him about it. The minister is open to further discussion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principles have been well argued here. The Senate has to balance its legitimate desire to have information about commercial activities of government owned businesses with the legitimate desire of those businesses, the government, and the parliament to ensure that those businesses have a reasonable opportunity effectively to compete in the marketplace without being disadvantaged by more onerous disclosure requirements than are reasonable. They will always have more disclosure requirements than a private sector competitor; that will always be the case. But we have to balance how far we push that extra disclosure requirement. I believe that we are pushing it a step further than the reasonable balance would suggest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we will be voting against the motion, and I hope the Senate votes against it. Whatever the outcome, we will not be dividing on this occasion. Our opposition is sufficiently clear and we do not need to reinforce it by division.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will support Senator Campbell's motion. The minister is correct in saying there is a difficult balance to be struck; we have debated that on a previous occasion. On that occasion I offered the view that I would accept commercial confidentiality being necessary where a lease has not been concluded or where, as in this case, a whole building has not been substantially let, but where a number of leases are under negotiation. In other words, if this building is in the market to be let, and we are either going to call tenders or have negotiations, then I would accept that to force total disclosure of commercial details at that point would disadvantage the operation of the unit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case it is my understanding&mdash;as it was in the other case before the Senate some months ago&mdash;that the leases in question have actually been concluded and legally completed. I do not see any problem with disclosure. I have been informed that the building is 87 per cent let. In the current state of the property market I believe that we can accept that this means that the building is substantially let. There will always be a minor factor of vacancy occurring in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, it appears to the Australian Democrats that the consideration of public disclosure of financial transactions which involve, or potentially involve, taxpayers' money require disclosure. The minister has said that in this particular transaction there is no incentive offered to the businesses or government organisations taking the leases; in other words, the minister claims that no subsidies involving taxpayers' money have been offered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is the case, there is even less need for the details of the transaction to remain confidential. Yesterday I contacted the minister's office, indicating our likely position. Clearly, there was an implied suggestion that, if the minister had an argument to offer against the position we were going to adopt, I was inviting the minister's office to provide that argument. I have not received any argument from either of the ministers' offices on this matter. On the basis of what the minister said today in the chamber and the facts before the Senate, the Australian Democrats will continue to support Senator Campbell's motion. </PARA>

If it is possible to resolve those concerns and fix the problem in this chamber, that would obviously be more sensible than going on a wing and a prayer that the government would take any notice of suggestions made after the bill leaves this chamber, since the government has the numbers in the House of Representatives and has not displayed a great capacity to take notice of alternative views in that place. I do not want to say much this morning on the basis of that understanding and I ask Senator Faulkner to indicate whether it is correct that we will only go to the second reading stage on this bill and will postpone the committee stage so that we can try to resolve some concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Faulkner. The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill amends seven acts and all but one, for us at least, are non-contentious. It amends the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to enable a delegation to a class of offices to catch offices created after the instrument of delegation was made. We have had no adverse comment in relation to consultations we have had in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986. I understand that these amendments have been requested by the Australian Payments Clearing Association&mdash;APCA&mdash;and that they implement different procedures for internal and external presentments. Apparently there has been the capacity to have electronic presentments for some time, but there has been some confusion as to what the law was if a transaction was happening intra-bank as opposed to between banks. It is all a bit complicated for me. In any event, we are happy with those amendments and, therefore, happy to support that aspect of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an amendment to the Family Law Act 1975 which simply corrects a subsection numbering error in the act. There are amendments to the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976, which are a little more complicated than those to the Family Law Act. They broaden the power of a single judge to make interlocutory or consent orders in relation to pending appeals. They allow evidence to be obtained by video link, telephone or other appropriate means. If the witness is present in Australia, the evidence must be sworn. There is the opportunity in very limited circumstances for evidence overseas not to be sworn, and power is given to enable rules of court to be made dealing with the way evidence is given in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also gives the Federal Court the ability to make rules allowing the court to amend documents in a proceeding even if that would have the effect of raising a new cause of action that would, if the proceedings in relation to it were commenced at the time of the amendment, be out of time. The ability of the Federal Court to make such rules was questioned by Justice Toohey in a 1992 decision. The amendments overcome those doubts and bring the Federal Court in line with most other Australian jurisdictions. There are also amendments to the Judiciary Act 1903. The act presently provides that when the full court of the High Court delivers a judgment, at least two justices must be present. This bill will change that to ensure that a judgment can be delivered by one judge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those five acts come within the Attorney-General portfolio. There are then the two that come within the Justice portfolio, the first being the Financial Transaction Reports Act, dealing with what is now called Austrac, which used to be the Cash Transaction Reports Agency. That change enables the director of Austrac to have the powers of a departmental secretary under the Public Service Act 1992 as far as the act relates to Austrac, as if that branch were a separate department of the Australian Public Service. We do not object to that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move then to the one that is contentious, that is, the change to the Freedom of Information Act. As I understand it, this bill tries to undo something which we did a while ago but which we have now found is all too onerous and is not working and so would like to get rid of. But it does raise certain concerns. As I understand it, some time ago changes were made to ensure that consultation had to take place with persons about whom information had been sought. That has become a very onerous task, and the government now sees that it needs to be changed so that consultation has to take place only where the person to whom the information relates could reasonably claim or contend that the documents were exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not that anyone wants to leave a situation where there is an unnecessary work burden that the government may claim in some way has not provided the benefit it was expected to provide, but our concern is that people should be entitled to know when information about them held by government departments is being released. We are not satisfied at the moment as to what impact this change will have on that. I understand that is pretty much the same concern that the Democrats have, and we would be happy to listen to the ministerial response or to sort it out at a later time if there is some reasonable way of not leaving the government with an unnecessary burden but at the same time giving people the opportunity to realise that someone has made a request and may be reading about himself or herself in one capacity or another on the front page of the daily papers the following day. That would seem to be a sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether we can find a path that accommodates both of those needs remains to be seen. I am pleased that the government has been sensible enough to say that it will discontinue the process of this bill at the second reading stage so that we get an opportunity in this place to see whether the concerns that we and the Democrats have can be reasonably accommodated. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In large measure, the Australian Democrats support the amendments in this bill. It is essentially a housekeeping exercise that makes changes to a number of pieces of legislation and does not raise any matters of contention, apart from the amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The amendments to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 will increase the efficiency through procedural changes for the dealings with the electronic presentment of cheques. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Federal Court and Family Court acts amendments should expedite the litigation process, allowing greater scope as they do for the hearing of evidence by video, telephone or other means. The provisions in relation to the taking of evidence by video link technology are in line with measures recently passed in the Foreign Evidence Bill, which received all-party support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the matter that is causing some concern, that is, a number of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982, in particular the proposed amendments to section 27A of the act. In its original form, that section required a person to be consulted before any information about him or her was released to a third party applicant, but only when it appeared that the person might reasonably contend that the document should be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments to the act in 1991 removed disqualification, thus requiring consultation with people, allowing them a reasonable opportunity to contend that the documents were exempt. That measure appears sensible to the Australian Democrats. It appears to be careful of people's privacy. It is now claimed, however, that this requirement is too onerous and the bill allows a determination that consultation is not necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill prescribes criteria to be used in making that determination. An internal review mechanism is available, so if consultation takes place and the determination is made, nevertheless, to release the document, that internal review mechanism cuts in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were concerned about the implications of these proposed amendments. I approached Mr Kevin O'Connor, the Privacy Commissioner, for a view on the implications of the amendments. I received an answer by fax on 3 May, which includes the sentence, `I have today provided comments on the above bill to the Minister for Justice.' The Privacy Commissioner also indicates that it is his practice not to canvass with non-government members his concerns about bills. He indicates that any requests for such information should be made to the minister's office. I understand that the position the Privacy Commissioner adopts is grounded in the way the enabling legislation for establishing his office is phrased. Essentially, it requires that the Privacy Commissioner provide such information to the government, not directly to the parliament or, as a result, to members of other parties represented in the parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that is a totally untenable situation. I wrote immediately to the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) with two requests. One was very specific, requesting that the advice he has received from the Privacy Commissioner be released to me immediately in its literal form. Secondly, I flagged that I believe it is not satisfactory that this parliament cannot obtain advice on legislation directly from the Privacy Commissioner, except by grace and favour of the government minister. It is an appalling situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have requested the minister to set in train amendments to the relevant legislation to make sure that representatives of other parliamentary parties can approach the Privacy Commissioner for a ruling on proposed legislation. I put on record that, if the minister does not take action, I intend to seek amendments. If an opportunity to move such amendments does not arise in the near future, I will have prepared a private member's bill and will introduce that in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that this instance has documented an outrageous state of affairs; that a public officer such as the Privacy Commissioner is hobbled in giving advice on proposed government legislation which impinges on the privacy of citizens; that advice is not directly available to members of this parliament. I will pursue that matter with vigour. I would appreciate, even in the course of this debate, some advice from the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) as to the position he intends to adopt in response to my requests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With the job statement yesterday and the budget due next week, the Banking (State Bank of South Australia and Other Matters) Bill is a timely reminder of Labor's financial incompetence. It underlines a fact that ought to be seared into the hearts and minds of everyone right around Australia: that we cannot trust Labor with the till. Time and again it has been proved that Labor cannot manage money. If it cannot be prudent with government finance, it comes as little surprise that Labor fails dismally when it comes to overall economic management. That is highlighted by this piece of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Bank of South Australia has proved to be the greatest financial disaster in the history of Australia's public sector. A $3 billion loss for that bank is a shameful legacy left behind by the Labor Party in South Australia. Of course, it was like drawing teeth for the former Liberal opposition in South Australia to drag out the truth about the disaster of the Bannon and Arnold Labor governments with regard to the management of the State Bank in South Australia. Denial and cover up preceded the eventual admission that not all was well with the State Bank, and even then the initial admission regarding the problems of the State Bank was only partial. It was not for some significant period that we found out the enormous extent of the financial disaster and the losses that had been incurred by the State Bank and, indeed, the massive amount that South Australian taxpayers would have to pay to bail out the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of those massive losses&mdash;which, it was finally admitted, amounted to some $3 billion over the period since 1991&mdash;corporatisation and privatisation of the bank are certainly the best solution. But even that solution will not prevent generations of South Australians having to pay for Labor's folly as far as its mismanagement is concerned. In the lead-up to the last federal election, both the Liberal and the National parties promised financial assistance to help South Australia reduce the debt burden that had resulted from this gross mismanagement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think his interjection was quite timely, in fact. The present government promised an amount of $600 million on the basis that the bank would be corporatised and eventually privatised, and it is the purpose of this legislation to facilitate that process. First, the bill subjects what will become the Bank of South Australia Ltd, the new name for the State Bank, to Commonwealth supervision, as indeed are all other private sector banks. Secondly, the bill grants several income tax concessions to the Bank of South Australia Ltd as part of the process of including it in normal Commonwealth business taxation arrangements. Thirdly, this bill amends four acts to enable a streamlining of the transfer of assets of the State Bank of South Australia to the Bank of South Australia Ltd. So we see the bank, through this legislation, set up for that very necessary privatisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we now find that these problems with regard to the State Bank are not the only financial problems which South Australia faces as a result of a decade of mismanagement by Labor. In fact, after its 10 or 11 years in office in South Australia, we now find the true extent of its deplorable financial mismanagement, and the disaster that that means for the South Australian economy is finally revealed. This week in the South Australian parliament we saw tabled the report of the independent South Australian Commission of Audit. This has provided a very detailed and competent analysis of South Australia's finances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the former Labor governments in South Australia of Bannon, Arnold and their incompetent cronies used every means possible prior to last year's state election to cover up the cooked books. Because of more than a decade of Labor, every man, woman and child in South Australia now owes $9,909 in state debt. The unfunded liability for superannuation is now increasing at a rate of $200 million a year, with projections expected to reach more than $7 billion by the year 2021. The bottom line for South Australia is $10 billion worse than the former Labor government claimed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday a senator from South Australia on the other side, the Minister for Small Business, Customs and Construction, Senator Schacht, had the gall in this chamber to accuse the current new Liberal South Australian government of hiding the truth. He accuses the Brown government of this when we have had 11 years of Bannon and Arnold governments hiding the truth and telling lies to the people of South Australia. In fact, it is the Brown Liberal government which is drawing back the curtain and revealing the truth. It is no wonder we are here debating the need for special financial assistance to South Australia to help it reduce this massive debt burden that has been inherited from the former South Australian Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the former Labor government been prudent in its economic policies and financial management, and in its husbanding of the state resources over the past 10 or 11 years, the federal government would not be footing the bill for this $600 million bale out that is required. Of course, it is not the government at all which is footing the bill. South Australian taxpayers, along with the rest of Australia's taxpayers, will be footing the bill directly through their contributions to Commonwealth coffers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us make no mistake about who is responsible for creating the $10 billion black hole with which South Australians are now left. That indictment rests fairly and squarely on the shoulders of the former Labor government. It is because of the failed policies of Labor that all South Australians will be forced to endure what will become a very painful reform process. It is because of Labor's failed policies that the Public Service will face cutbacks. It is because of Labor's failed policies that liabilities in South Australia will increase by $14,840 every hour of every day for the next 28 years. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For 10 years the Labor government in South Australia kept the state's finance books firmly sealed away from public scrutiny or accountability. As long ago as April 1988 the South Australian Auditor-General pleaded with the then Labor government to report on unfunded liabilities. Six years ago the Auditor-General said, `You must give a report. You must come clean on what these liabilities are.' Four years ago the Auditor-General again called upon the Labor government to provide information concerning the accumulated costs of these liabilities. All the while, the Labor government and its mates embarked upon an extravagant spending spree with taxpayers' money, without any heed for the consequences for South Australians or the South Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The former government ducked and weaved its way around answering the hard questions, quite content to leave them to future generations of South Australians. So we are left with this enormous difficulty and problem. There is no doubt that this can be described as a gross act of financial vandalism for 10 years. It was only when Labor was recently thrown out of office in South Australia that a commitment was made to the public to reveal the true extent of the state's finances when the new Liberal government came to office.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only in South Australia that Labor's incompetence as financial managers has been revealed. In Victoria the former Labor government left its mark with the collapse of the Tricontinental and Pyramid financial institutions, plunging Victorians similarly into financial chaos, from which the Kennett government is now slowly but surely ensuring that Victoria emerges. In Western Australia, Labor's corporate cowboys strangled investment and economic growth through their abysmal financial dealings involving the now infamous WA Inc. Again, it is a Liberal government&mdash;the Court government&mdash;that has had to come into office to clean up the mess and put the Western Australian economy back on the road to success. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder, then, that the Australian people have little confidence in Labor's capacity to responsibly manage the economy. Next week the Treasurer (Mr Willis) will deliver the government's budget on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the government. Yet again we will see a Labor government afraid to face up to the hard questions, the real issues, to take the steps required to get this nation back on its feet again, to implement measures for real and sustained economic growth, to stimulate long-term genuine employment to benefit all Australians instead of its usual practice of juggling the numbers, as it has done in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister would do well to remember that, while he huffs and puffs about this place next week trying to sell his budget, manipulating figures and fudging statistics to make them look publicly palatable in preparation for the next election, the chickens will soon come home to roost in the federal parliament, just as they did in South Australia, Western Australia and Victoria. Given the experience of Labor mismanagement we have had in those three states, one can only wonder what the next Liberal and National Party government will find when it opens up the federal government's books following the next federal election, after 12 or 13 years of financial mismanagement by Labor at the federal level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In stark contrast to that experience of mismanagement by Labor right around this country, we now have Liberal state governments addressing the economic mess that has been left behind by Labor, especially in those three states. Indeed, as I have said, they are already succeeding. Within a year or so of their taking office in Victoria and Western Australia, we see the economy turning around. We see business starting to develop and grow again, in marked contrast to what happened under Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill supports the creation by the new Liberal South Australian government of a new corporatised bank to be known as the Bank of South Australia Ltd. Eventually, that bank will be sold off to the private sector in a privatisation process. But it is a tragedy that that has had to happen and it is a tragedy that can be sheeted home only to the mismanagement of Labor in South Australia. As I said, that reflects the mismanagement of Labor right around this country. So, while the coalition supports this legislation and the offer of $600 million to South Australia on the condition that the State Bank is corporatised and privatised, we certainly do not support the economic woes and the financial mismanagement that have been endemic under Labor governments around this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Banking (State Bank of South Australia and Other Matters) Bill 1994 will, as has been said, facilitate the corporatisation process of the State Bank of South Australia. The bank, following what we regard as its disastrous credit binge in the 1980s, has been split into two entities&mdash;the Bank of South Australia, its customer bank arm, the so-called `good bank'; and, with its $3 billion debt, the `bad bank' which has been taken over by the government. How we can call banks `good' and `bad' is a bit beyond me. Under the restructuring, the SBSA will cease to exist, and the BSA will take over the assets of the former bank. The new bank will then be established as a corporate entity and, under the conditions of the pre-election Keating-Arnold deal, the bank will be sold.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us just go on and have a look. There is short term and long term&mdash;Senator Macdonald can only think of the short term. The bank is very likely to be sold to another bank or an insurance company and subsumed into its operations. This will mean that South Australia will lose the corporate headquarters of its only bank. Senior bank management is concerned that the employment numbers in the bank could be reduced from 3,500 to 1,500 as a result of such a takeover. The state government will lose up to $100 million in operating profits. The bank itself will lose its primary asset, which is its government guarantee for small investors. The bank will be less able to influence the cost of finance in the housing and rural finance markets. These are costs which are borne in the long term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that, given the glut of state and federal privatisations flooding the equity market, expectations of a $1 billion price tag may not be met. I remember my state colleagues in South Australia suggesting that perhaps as little as $600 million will be the fire sale price. I think it is galling that it is the good bank&mdash;the still profitable consumer and housing credit arm of the bank&mdash;that will be sold. The necessity for it to be sold is because of the conditions attached to the $600 million federal assistance package between Prime Minister Keating and former Premier Arnold still sought by the Brown government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tells us this is an excessively generous deal. We have to remember that it will net South Australia the equivalent of just six years of operating profits from the bank. The strings attached to the deal will cost South Australia more than that. It worries me that the Commonwealth in this bill is trying to redefine this, and it will be at some expense to the people of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The four conditions of the deal were that the bank be sold as quickly as possible; that the bank be brought into the Commonwealth tax net free of tax losses from 1 July 1994; that the bank become subject to the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank from 1 July 1994; and that the South Australian government implement a debt management strategy. It is the second of those conditions which this bill deals with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 52 of the bill seeks to ensure that the new owner will be denied tax deductions for the $45 million of unfunded superannuation liabilities from the State Bank of South Australia. This is the sort of redefinition that the Democrats are worried about&mdash;redefining conditions of the offer. Future superannuation deductions do not represent a current tax loss; they represent a future deduction. The effect of denying the bank a future deduction will be to reduce the asset value of the bank by $45 million. That is $45 million owned by the people of South Australia, who are already denied the difference between the expected price and the fire sale price. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My second concern with this section is that the change to the tax deductibility of superannuation contributions will make it more likely that the new owners will seek to change superannuation arrangements. Superannuation arrangements of the new bank were a topic of long negotiations at the state level. My state colleague Mike Elliott reluctantly supported the corporatisation bill when the superannuation matters were finally sorted out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats seek two assurances from the government. The first is that the South Australian government was well aware that the $600 million compensation deal would include this $45 million loss of future deductions in the definition of tax loss. The second assurance we are seeking is that there is sufficient legislative protection at state and federal levels to ensure that the pressure on the new owners to reduce these unfunded liabilities by restricting the scheme to the detriment of existing employees cannot occur. I think the opposition should take this aspect very seriously. We are talking about people's superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that Senator Watson feels very strongly about fiddling with and redefining what people are entitled to when they enter into a superannuation scheme. I need those assurances, or I may ask Senator Watson, in particular, to join in supporting an amendment to oppose clause 52. I am not persuaded that the $600 million compensation is such a generous offer that it cannot be interfered with. The government has argued that such an offer may act as a precedent for future generous deals. The Democrats believe that bank bailouts can and should be distinguished from other privatisation compensation deals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has said that the only reason state banks need to be sold off is the mismanagement of state Labor governments across Australia, but I wonder whether that is the only reason. I think it can also be argued that bank bailouts have been necessary because of the lax credit supervision regime created by the financial deregulation reforms of this federal government. As the royal commission report pointed out, the banking environment created by the federal government in the 1980s was so lax and so gung-ho that outrageous banking practices were encouraged. In fact, they were eulogised rather than stomped on. They were allowed to continue. Hence, the Australian banking sector has sailed so close to the wind and to collapse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government continues, in the aftermath, to allow banks to charge interest rate margins more than twice the OECD average to help them limp back into the black. So it is not just Labor governments' mismanagement but also the regime that was created under which those state governments felt confident to operate. In our view, the federal government is as culpable as&mdash;possibly more culpable than&mdash;the South Australian government for the collapse of the State Bank. It should not now be able to redefine the deal to make the people of South Australia pay more for the policy excesses of its failure. </PARA>

This measure has bipartisan support. Both major parties went into the last election campaign as federal parties committed to doing what was necessary to facilitate the corporatisation and privatisation of this bank. The South Australian state Liberal government went into the last state election campaign committed to the ultimate privatisation of this bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to speak on this bill because it is an opportunity for me, as someone who was very intimately involved with events during this period, to remind the Senate and the people of Australia of the disaster which this State Bank collapse represents. This bank lost over $3,000 million in a very short space of time in a state which has only 1.5 million people. It does not take long to work out that we are talking about a debt of $2,000 that has been left to every man, woman and child&mdash;including my three-year-old son&mdash;in South Australia as a result of this tragedy. It is, remarkably, the biggest corporate loss in Australia's corporate history. This occurred in a little state like South Australia&mdash;the weakest and most impoverished state on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scale of this disaster is beyond belief. Tragically, this is the outcome of governments getting involved in commercial enterprises, and that lesson must be seared into the minds and brains of every politician&mdash;particularly every Labor politician&mdash;in this country. This is what can happen when governments own commercial enterprises; when we risk taxpayers' money in the financial marketplace. If ever there was proof of the truth that governments should never get involved in commercial enterprises of this kind, this is it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This whole debacle is what privatisation is all about. This is the real reason why the Liberal Party is committed to privatisation and why the Labor Party has belatedly recognised the truth of the need to privatise government commercial enterprises. The Labor Party, nationally and corporately, should hang its head in shame over what has happened in South Australia as a result of the collapse of this bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the bank in South Australia that was losing taxpayers' money in commercial enterprises: the State Government Insurance Commission lost hundreds of millions of dollars in a ridiculous deal on a building in Melbourne. We had this idiotic idea of a government company in South Australia attempting to develop something called scrimber and some $60 million went down the drain. It is not just the bank that we are talking about; the government has a whole legacy of failed commercial enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that every single Labor member has learnt a huge lesson from this tragedy. To the satisfaction of the Australian nation, it appears that the right wing of the Labor Party has learnt the lesson. Unfortunately, the Left of the Labor Party appears not to have learnt that lesson. I noticed a headline this morning which stated that the Left is gathering support to oppose the government's plan to sell off federal airports. It staggers me that the Left of the Labor Party has learnt nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, it would appear that the Australian Democrats have learnt nothing, if I am to read Senator Kernot correctly. She says that the Australian Democrats reluctantly support this bill. The Democrats have been very reluctant to learn the lessons from the fate of the State Bank in South Australia. The Democrats seem to retain their old socialist leanings and believe that governments should still get involved in these sorts of enterprises. The Democrats get very nervous when we approach privatisation. That staggers me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The state Labor government in South Australia sat on its hands while this bank went totally out of control. I concur with what Senator Kernot said about the absolute binge that this bank went on. Marcus Clarke went on a lending binge of a type that this country has never seen before; lending money not only all over South Australia, but all over Australia and all over the world&mdash;all this from a small regional bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people responsible for this&mdash;the state government, which represented one and a half million shareholders in this bank&mdash;just sat by and allowed this binge to go on without exercising any control or responsibility. Throughout this period the state Labor government attacked us, the state opposition, for raising questions. For having the audacity to ask a few questions in the state parliament, for questioning the basis of the bank, we were attacked relentlessly as being anti-South Australian, as being treacherous to the interests of South Australia. A relentless campaign was waged against us for having the wit to ask a question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That brings me to the 1985 state campaign, where we proposed the privatisation of entities such as the State Bank. We then faced a massive ALP scare campaign, including, to its great shame, the federal Labor government attacking us for proposing the privatisation of things such as the bank. The great irony now is that, if the Liberal Party had won the 1985 state election, the taxpayers and consumers of South Australia, including the Australian Democrats, would have been spared this $3,000 million loss we now carry. The bank, if sold then, would have brought a considerable price, prior to Marcus Clarke wrecking it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to take this opportunity to pay tribute to former Senator John Olsen, who led that campaign with great courage and tenacity in the face of this outrageous campaign against him by the Labor Party. It is a tragedy that John was not elected on that occasion and given the opportunity as premier to save South Australians from the debacle and tragedy that befell them as a result of Labor's campaign in that election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a particular political point I hope the Democrats will take note of. This is not simply a matter of loss of money; when a commercial enterprise such as this is in state government hands, it is an open invitation to political corruption of the worst kind. We saw that, in the case of this bank, in the 1987 federal election and, more particularly and to the great sorrow of John Olsen, the 1989 state election, when the state Labor government blatantly used taxpayers' money to bribe the bank not to increase interest rates prior to those elections. That very act on its own cost John Olsen the 1989 state election. The government used $2 million of taxpayers' money to get the State Bank to stall the interest rate increase that every other bank in the country was bringing in, and so eased its way back into office with only 48 per cent of the vote at that election. This was rank political corruption of the worst kind, and it is what happens when a government owns an enterprise of this kind. Corruption is almost unavoidable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The State Bank of South Australia, which is the subject of this bill, is the most dramatic example imaginable of what can happen when a government invests taxpayers' dollars in commercial enterprises. The Labor Party in South Australia has paid the greatest price imaginable for what occurred. For its own reckless irresponsibility, it has been reduced to less than a cricket team in my state, with only 10 seats. It will take that party a generation to get back into office. I hope that all Labor members, and indeed all Democrats, have learned this lesson so that the people of Australia can be spared further debacles of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As someone who was around for that 1985 state campaign, I am amazed at how far the ALP has travelled since then, and I give it credit for that. It is refreshing to see an ALP government saying that it will do things such as selling off all federal airports, which it obviously should. Clearly, the ALP has learned something from this. It proves, given the example of the 1985 state campaign, that it is the Liberal Party in this country that is the party of ideas. It is the Labor Party that trots along behind, learning the lessons from what we have been telling it and the people of Australia. We are the champion of ideas, of economic reform and of the things that need to be done to prevent debacles of the kind represented by the collapse of this bank. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To be fair to Senator Chapman, he may have been criticising the circumstances rather than simply the fact that the bank was being privatised. Senator Kernot raised two specific points that I wish to address. The first point is the issue of what we believe is the $45 million in unfunded superannuation liabilities. I am advised that when the federal government commenced negotiations with the state government it was not aware of the extent of the unfunded liabilities in the superannuation fund, although it was certainly aware that an unfunded liability existed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure may not be $45 million; it may be some figure greater than that. The reason we cannot be precise about it is that the liabilities increase the longer that the bank is in state government ownership, because that liability continues to accrue for the employees under the government scheme. Depending upon the date of sale, we will then have a precise figure on the unfunded superannuation liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other factors that will affect the unfunded superannuation liabilities, such as the number of employees that are with the bank on the date of sale. Some employees may take early retirement; some may take some form of redundancy payment. So the precise figure will become available only upon the date of the sale of the bank. I am advised that the figure could be anywhere between $45 million and $60 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government took the view that it was not prepared to enter into a deal or a package that had an open-ended cost in the superannuation area. During the course of negotiations, when the unfunded liabilities in the superannuation area were discussed, the government put forward the view that it would not enter into an open-ended commitment in this area and that, as part of the total compensation package of $600 million, this liability should be included. I think it needs to be looked at in that context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the South Australian government's point of view, it is a good package. It would be unreasonable to expect the Commonwealth to have entered into some agreement which said $600 million-plus, depending on the sale of the bank and the superannuation liability. It simply was not prepared to do that. Certainly the state government would have liked as much money as it could get; we are sure of that. But the final package reflects that particular provision on superannuation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad fact that most government superannuation funds in this country are substantially underfunded. Senator Kernot, Senator Watson and I know that because of our involvement with the superannuation committee. All states except Queensland, all governments&mdash;Labor, Liberal and National Party&mdash;going back to before World War II when most of the government schemes were introduced, have not funded their superannuation funds. So why should the Commonwealth pick up an open-ended liability in this area? It simply was not prepared to do that. We certainly believe the package is justified but we regard it as generous in the sense of picking up a substantial part of the problems of the Bank of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that Senator Kernot raised was: is there legislative protection in this package to protect the current employees' entitlements in the superannuation area? She wanted this included in the legislation. We regard this as a matter that had to be dealt with by the South Australian government in the South Australian government legislation. I understand that there have been very substantial negotiations&mdash;I do not have the details of the negotiations&mdash;in South Australia, and that this is reflected in the final agreement in the package of South Australian legislation. I do not have those details with me. That package, as Senator Kernot pointed out, was supported by the Democrats reluctantly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not view it as proper, an agreement having been reached, for the Commonwealth to come in over the top of that and attempt to rewrite something in the superannuation area. We do not believe that is proper, the parties having thrashed it out locally; and, with respect to Senator Kernot, we do not believe that it is proper for the Democrats, having been involved at the state level and having supported the legislation, albeit reluctantly, to then try that here.

I would like the parliamentary secretary, in consideration of that answer, to look at what the eminent judges said in the cases involving the Shell company and Westpac because, while it might be attractive to the Commonwealth and to the South Australian government, those of us who have sat on this superannuation committee, including Senator Sherry and Senator Kernot, are very concerned about transferring the rights, under various circumstances, of existing employees.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have unfunded-type schemes here in the Commonwealth. If it is good enough to have full accounting and payment for fringe benefits tax liabilities which cost the Commonwealth hundreds of thousands of dollars to administer because of its time-consuming nature and detailed accounting requirements to meet the tax act, then perhaps, in view of the statements that have been made today, we should be considering forthwith whether these Commonwealth schemes should be fully funded. </PARA>

During the lunchtime debate we will talk about the extension of the superannuation industry supervision rules to the public sector.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on behalf of the coalition to speak about the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. It is an omnibus bill which makes a number of amendments to existing legislation within the industry, science and technology portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will turn to the amendment to the National Measurement Act. The National Measurement Act 1960, formerly the Weights and Measures Act, is the enabling legislation for the National Standards Commission, which was established to advise the government on matters relating to Australia's national measurement system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission consists of a chair, an executive director and six other members with expertise in such areas as technology, physics, chemistry and engineering. The specific functions of the commission include the promotion and coordination of the use in Australia of a uniform system of units and standards; the examination and approval of patterns of measuring instruments; and the promotion of the adoption in the states and territories of uniform legislation relating to patterns of measuring instruments for trade purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission was subject to an external program of evaluation in 1992. The review was conducted by Dr Kevin Foley. In his report he found that the commission's programs were efficient and cost effective, but were hindered by a lack of resources. The report made a number of recommendations, and the amendments being debated are a response to those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments provide for an increase in the number of members from six to eight; for an increase in the limits on contracts which the commission may make without ministerial approval from $100,000 to $250,000; for the commission to have the power to invest surplus funds with an approved bank in Commonwealth securities or in a way approved by the Treasurer; and for the commission to make grants and provide other financial assistance relating to meteorology and the promotion of meteorology and meteorology research. The opposition is in agreement with these changes. There are also minor technical amendments to the Patents Act 1990 which I will not go into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The more important issue is the amendment to the Pooled Development Funds Act. The legislation provides for an amendment to that 1992 act to extend from 12 months to 18 months the period to which the most recent audited accounts of an investee company must relate for the purpose of determining the value of the total assets of a company before a pooled development fund invests in the company. This change reflects the fact that the audited accounts for the previous financial year are generally not available for up to six months into the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pooled development funds cannot invest in companies which have assets of more than $30 million. Currently, audited accounts are used to determine the value of those assets and must be in respect of a period not less than 12 months before the investment was made. As such, pooled development funds, or PDFs, cannot invest for up to the first six months of a financial year because the audited accounts for the previous year are generally not available. That is normal commercial practice. Pooled development funds were introduced by the government in February 1992 in the Investing in the Nation statement. They were designed to address the lack of availability of capital for small and medium sized enterprises. Favourable tax treatment is given to those registered companies which provide equity capital under PDF arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition view is that the PDF scheme has been unsuccessful. Few companies have registered as a source of funds. In fact, in this morning's newspaper it is reported that only five such companies have registered to date. The government has recognised the failure of the concept and recently reduced the tax rate applying to PDFs from 30 per cent to 25 per cent. It gave notice in yesterday's statement of further reducing it to 15 per cent. The coalition opposed the introduction of the PDF scheme when the enacting legislation came before the House and the Senate in June 1992. The concept was criticised as being too similar to the management investment company scheme&mdash;the MIC scheme&mdash;which had operated previously. The MIC scheme was also unsuccessful and was eventually terminated in June 1991. In fact, the report in 1987 by the Bureau of Industry Economics on the MIC scheme recommended that the scheme should finish the next year. The BIE concluded that the scheme was seen as a catalyst, not as a permanent force of assistance for capital provision.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition argued that the PDF scheme would encourage the bureaucratisation of investment at the expense of individual portfolio investment. At the time the scheme was introduced, many facets of industry and the finance sector were critical of the concept. The Industry Commission, in its report on the availability of capital, did not support the PDF scheme. The commission concluded that the availability of capital for small and medium sized businesses depended largely on the rate of return. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission does not consider that direct Government intervention to expend institutional funds available to smaller companies would improve the efficiency of the capital market or the economy generally.</PARA>
<PARA>The PDF concept is being tinkered with in this legislation. The concept is no substitute for the genuine and comprehensive reform measures that are needed to encourage investment in this country. What is really required is greater labour flexibility, reduction in government expenditure, reduction in the government deficit, and provision of a secure environment for investment. The government has failed in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, this amendment will only tinker with the PDF scheme and, as a consequence, will do little to encourage investment in this country. The opposition will not oppose the amendment, but we remind the government that it will not make any significant change to what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to the Senate that the Labor government has been good on rhetoric but very poor on economic management and substance. Yesterday's statement by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) included reference to these changes to PDFs.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comments in this morning's press point out that even with this tinkering and the proposal set out in the statement yesterday, the PDFs will still not be attractive to the investment industry. A headline in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> reads, `White Paper a bit pale for banks, investment industry'. I quote from the article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But industry sources said the concept of encouraging investment in small companies through PDFs was misguided.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current rules encouraged small retail investors to put their money in PDFs, but this type of investment was too risky and volatile for this type of investor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand. . . PDFs had not proved attractive to large institutional investors.</PARA>
<PARA>And why not? The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation funds are becoming more interested in investing money in development capital.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But they prefer to invest in development capital via a unit trust because the trust does not pay any tax on income, such as capital gains and dividends. Instead, the super funds pay tax on the income they receive at their concessional rate of 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, because PDFs have a company structure, any income they generate is taxed within the company before being distributed to the super fund.</PARA>
<PARA>So this scheme is not going to be attractive to superannuation funds. Having regard to those sorts of comments from the finance industry, I stress again that this is a matter of tinkering around the edges of a scheme which has failed in the past. It is unlikely to be attractive in the future and it is time that the government got on and really did something about freeing up the various markets and reducing costs so that genuine investment for real jobs is encouraged in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Industry, Technology and Regional Development Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. It is an omnibus bill. Three parts of the bill make various amendments which the Australian Democrats do not oppose. Part 3 will increase the number of members of the National Standards Commission from six to eight. Part 4 contains a technical amendment to the Patents Act consequent upon amendments to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, with reference in the Patents Act to the 1958 continental shelf convention. These references are no longer appropriate. Part 5 deals with companies applying for pooled development fund investments. It changes the period to which these accounts must relate in recognition of the fact that audited accounts usually are not available until six months into the next financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to the comments on pooled development funds made by Senator Gibson. I agree that there is a great difficulty at the moment in Australia in marshalling investment funds for productive purposes in Australian industry. Australian industry might be more willing to go along that road to further capital investment, which is clearly needed, if it could get some certainty from government as to the policies that government will follow in the industry and trade portfolios. One can hardly blame Australian industry for being reticent when it is being thrown to the wolves by a very harsh and fast program of reducing protection to Australian industries, even when these industries are strategically important to the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other ways of marshalling investment funds which the government should look at. One of them is to provide a savings incentive to Australian small investors who are prepared to put their savings into a venture development capital fund. This is one of the suggestions the Australian Democrats have made in our budget proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other suggestion is to require superannuation funds to invest at least a small amount, which we suggest should be one per cent of their funds&mdash;which after all were accumulated by giving tax incentives to savers, tax incentives which have cost the Australian taxpayer&mdash;in productive areas, particularly in the venture capital area, which is a difficult one since, while we are a very inventive nation and intellectually very vigorous, we seem not to be able to translate that into a finished product that can be used to obtain a bridgehead in international markets. Time and again, we read about inventions that have been developed in Australia but are then snapped up by foreign companies. I think there is a lot of work to be done in that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The burden of my comments today will be directed towards the privatisation proposals in the bill on the AIDC. An amendment has been circulated by the government proposing to delete that part of the bill. I should be grateful to the government for saving me the trouble because, if that part of the bill had been left in the legislation, I would have moved an amendment to delete it. I rather regret that the government's motive in moving an amendment to delete the provisions relating to the sale of AIDC is somewhat different from the motive that would have been mine in moving such an amendment. I would have wanted the government to retain its current shareholding in AIDC, whereas the government, far from wishing to retain that shareholding, has decided that it wants to sell the lot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not want any public ownership component in AIDC, which is an agency designed to assist Australian industries in obtaining access to funds for productive development. I would have thought that was precisely the strategic direction in which our government should travel and was precisely the strategic assistance that should be provided to Australian industries at a time when we are struggling to maintain our position in overseas markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest balance of payments figures, which were released yesterday, have shown a substantial deterioration in our balance of payments with a massive surge of imports and are again proof of the failure of government policy in this area. However, the government has decided that it does not wish to retain any shareholding, despite the fact that official ALP policy, as it is currently in existence, prohibits the sale of the AIDC and obliges the government to retain 51 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has jumped the gun on his party's policy and has said that the government intends to sell the lot. He has jumped the gun, and he will need to seek approval from the ALP national conference to give agreement to that. I think that is a very instructive example of how the ALP works in government. The government makes somewhat arrogantly and high-handedly major decisions which are contrary to ALP policy and then expects the party to fall in behind the government's decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that there is considerable disquiet in the government's ranks about this decision on two counts: firstly, the process, which, of course, is a matter for the party; and, secondly, the substance of the policy direction that this once again indicates. The process in a sense is also a matter of some concern because, when a party gets elected to government, it gets elected to government on the basis of its published policy platform. Voters can and should be able to rely on those documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular case it is not being changed through the processes one would acknowledge as legitimate, it is being changed by fiat&mdash;by a government decision out of the blue. I would expect that at some stage the government will raise the issue again when it has bulldozed these measures through the party structure, and we will again be dealing with the issue of the sale of AIDC. It may be useful to advert to one other aspect of the proposed sale&mdash;apart from the strategic one which I have raised&mdash;and that is whether selling a good earner which funnels profits back to the shareholders, who are the Australian taxpayers, is the best way to raise money or whether the government should not be still using its capacity to raise loan funds in the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look quickly at the facts. In 1988 AIDC was faced with a capital shortage. The government's response was to transfer nearly all of the operational assets of AIDC to a subsidiary, AIDC Ltd, in order to facilitate listing on the stock exchange. The parent company&mdash;the corporation&mdash;is a statutory authority. The legislation passed at the time allowed sale to the public of up to 30 per cent of AIDC Ltd's nominal capital of $200 million. Currently the Commonwealth, through the parent company, retains 81 per cent of AIDC Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government originally announced its intention to reduce its shareholding in AIDC Ltd from 81 per cent to 51 per cent in August 1992, and that was included in the proposed assets sales published in the 1992-93 budget. This position is anchored in ALP policy. However, poor financial performance at the time had impacted heavily on the AIDC Ltd share price, which dropped as low as 44c per share from an issue price of $2 per share. The government then announced that the sale would not take place until the government was able to get full value for AIDC Ltd's underlying assets. The sale was again listed under proposed assets sales in the 1993-94 budget. The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce announced on 25 November 1993 that the sale would take place in the first quarter of 1994 following the release of AIDC Ltd's half-yearly results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To some extent the government can be seen as having `missed the boat' yet again. The share price of AIDC Ltd peaked at over $2.90 late last year; it dropped 15c in February on the release of its half-yearly results, which showed a profit of $20.6 million, down slightly from last year; and the share price is now down to $2.50 in a somewhat more shaky market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1993-94 budget incorporated assets sales of $2.6 billion. Even with this and the other still available possible sale&mdash;Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, which would yield roughly $350 million this year&mdash;the government will realise only about $2 billion. The 30 per cent sale of AIDC would have yielded $90 to $100 million. Let us remember that the profit derived from it was $20 million. The government will obviously be keen to achieve these sales this financial year to make the deficit outcome look better. However, the political situation in terms of ALP policy impacting on it may make that a little more doubtful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this particular situation why does the government not raise funds in the debt market, when it proposes giving away an asset by selling equity which has shown a substantial earning capacity? Why does the government intend doing it this way? The only answer can be found in the figures I have quoted. The government intends improving the look of its balance sheet&mdash;its budget will look better by selling assets rather than by retaining them, getting a higher profit flow and seeking loan capital at a much lower cost in the open market than the profit it derives from its AIDC shareholding, which will be lost when AIDC Ltd is sold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of its shareholders, the Australian taxpayers, the government is making a financially and commercially stupid decision&mdash;a criminally negligent decision. The only reason is to make its budget papers look better. So we should look at the way our budget is framed. In large measure, it is a cashflow statement rather than a balance sheet. We should look at changing that and producing a balance sheet that shows clearly and factually the consequences of government financial decisions, rather than, as shown in this example, finagled figures at a substantial cost to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the government's announced intention to move an amendment to delete the part which would have brought about the sale of AIDC. Clearly, my reasons for welcoming it are somewhat different from the government's reasons for moving that particular amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate now has before it the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Bill 1994, which will make amendments to allow superannuation schemes for Commonwealth civilian employees to comply with the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993, known as the SIS Act, and associated legislation. The bill amends four acts: the Superannuation Act 1976; the Superannuation Legislation Amendment Act 1990; the Superannuation Act 1990; and the Superannuation Benefits (Supervisory Mechanisms) Act 1990. All these acts relate to the provision of superannuation benefits for Commonwealth sector employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the SIS legislation was preceded by the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act only in 1987. It is somewhat ironic that that act had to be completely replaced within seven years of its introduction to parliament. The new act is certainly very much superior, and it was certainly improved upon as a result of your participation, Madam Acting Deputy President, on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which reviewed that particular act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now decided that all Commonwealth sector superannuation schemes should comply with the SIS Act, and I think we all heartily agree with that. This bill commences that process of altering the various Commonwealth schemes. So, in due time, we will see these sorts of schemes replicated through the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators would be aware that the main thrust of the changes to the SIS legislation and the regulations which commenced after 1 July this year will give trustees a greater responsibility for and control over the administration of funds under their control. At the same time, arising from the legislation before us, the powers of the minister and the role of the employer have therefore been diminished in some areas. But in other cases the ministerial responsibilities will be shared with the trustees. For example, many of the discretions previously exercised by the minister have been replaced by specific provisions in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SIS Act deals in the main with the prudential supervision of the superannuation industry as it essentially applied to the private sector. As mentioned earlier, this bill now extends the wide arms of the SIS prudential standards to certain Commonwealth funds. Apparently, under the Superannuation Act 1976 the Commissioner for Superannuation and the board of trustees share the responsibility for the administration of the Commonwealth superannuation scheme, known as the CSS. Under the SIS legislation, there can be only one responsible entity, and the bill makes the trustee of the SIS that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the SIS legislation requires that the rules of a superannuation fund may not allow trustees of the fund to be directed by another person or any other person to exercise a discretion unilaterally. The rules of the fund should also not be changed without the approval of the trustees. Therefore, under this legislation the trustees of both the CSS and the PSS&mdash;the PSS, of course, followed the CSS&mdash;are not subject to any direction by any person except the minister, as provided for under the SIS Act. In a sense, I believe, therefore, it is somewhat reassuring for Commonwealth sector public servants that their funds will now be protected in the same way as the private sector funds are protected under the SIS legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that in its first major report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Safeguarding Superannuation</EMPHASIS>, the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation made some strong recommendations for implementing measures to safeguard retirement income savings. The recommendation resulted in legislation being passed&mdash;the SIS legislation that I referred to&mdash;which set up prudential standards for the superannuation industry; and these will commence on 1 July 1994. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the SIS Act, for obvious reasons, exempts certain public sector superannuation schemes from those controls, under section 19(7), the government has decided that all Commonwealth superannuation schemes with invested funds will comply with the SIS Act and its associated legislation. Those without an invested fund will comply with the main requirements of SIS, particularly preservation. This is an example of government superannuation funds making a concerted effort to comply with the SIS Act for the benefit of their members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will be interesting to see how long it takes the Commonwealth to adjust the parliamentarians scheme. It is interesting to see the Commonwealth endeavouring to subject itself to the same rules as private sector superannuation funds. The Senate committee was informed that some of the states would have difficulty adjusting their rules to meet SIS. I believe that in time they will and that is why the committee recommended that the government give them time to adjust to the new regime. The proposed amendments will result in the Minister for Finance having his role in the administration of these funds somewhat diminished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should take this opportunity of saying that I find it a little unusual that the responsibility for these funds had its genesis in the Department of Finance. All previous superannuation legislation came from the Treasury. Therefore, I ask Senator Collins, as the responsible minister, whether Treasury officials who have direct responsibility for superannuation, particularly the Commissioner for Superannuation, have cast their eye over these funds to make sure they comply with the SIS rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With due respect to the Department of Finance, it does not have the day-to-day, ongoing expertise of Mr George Pooley's Insurance and Superannuation Commission. It is important that we get that assurance to make sure it has passed the flick test and has been before the relevant officers of the Insurance and Superannuation Commission to make sure that the legislation we are debating today has been reviewed by people with technical expertise. Coming back to procedural requirements, the trustees will be able subsequently to further comply with their duties and responsibilities as required under SIS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The SIS legislation places a great onus on trustees to provide members with quality information on the operation of the fund. My observation of the CSS and PSS schemes is that they are doing just that. I would like to take this opportunity of commending them on their work and their enterprise in this direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acquaint honourable senators with a number of the current publications. I have before me <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News Update</EMPHASIS>, the newsletter to PSS members. That comes from the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 1. The second document is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Access</EMPHASIS>, the newsletter to CSS members from the Commonwealth Superannuation Board of Trustees No. 2. I would like to table these quality documents. I believe they set a standard for the private sector to follow and therefore the Comsuper group, which was responsible for the publications, should be congratulated in this respect. I seek leave to have these documents tabled in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The only point of contention is that the CSS and the PSS perhaps do not participate as fully in all the superannuation investment performances as they might, although I understand they are moving in that direction. I congratulate them for that. Because the funds are recognised as registered and complying superannuation funds, fund members will be able to seek appropriate advice and assistance from the soon to be established superannuation complaints tribunal, which is part of the prudential standards that will come into effect on 1 July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that they will have access to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will provide both the CSS and the PSS members with a very low cost dispute resolution mechanism, although they already have access to administrative law revenue tribunals such as the AAT. As we are aware, this is a low cost dispute resolution mechanism, and I believe that it will be an important adjunct to the rights that are available to CSS and PSS members. The Superannuation Complaints Tribunal will operate in a less litigious and adversarial way, and this is very good for fund members, many of whom have difficulty grappling with the complexities of their schemes, despite the excellent publications I have just referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments proposed in the bill do not alter&mdash;and this is important&mdash;the benefit design of the schemes provided for by the legislation and, therefore, there is no financial impact. Honourable senators listening to this debate would therefore recognise why I had such concern about a previous bill when it was indicated that, because there was an unfunded element, certain governments could walk away from their responsibilities to their employees. I put it to the Senate that it really should not make any difference whether it is funded or unfunded. I therefore sought assurances because, in future, that may set a precedent for some people in the CSS or the PSS where the government decides to hive off some of those activities to the private sector and, in order to get the price right, could well suddenly do a deal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sought some time so that we could consult with the union to make sure that everything was fair and above board and that the rights of the people who have entitlements under that scheme were not diminished in any way. I believe that that is an appropriate role for this Senate. Since we are talking about improving and enhancing prudential standards for both CSS and PSS employees under this legislation, I again took the liberty to remind the Senate of my concern about the members of the fund and their transfer rights. I commend the bill to the Senate and I thank the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This bill amends the Telecommunications Act 1991 to relax prohibitions on price discrimination and to set up a process under which Austel will be able to test telecommunication tariffs for their anti-competitive effects. The Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994 is designed to deal with the apparent illegality of various pricing options introduced by both Telecom and Optus. The most important of these have been Telecom's flexiplan schemes and the strategic partnership arrangements entered into by Telecom customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently in the Federal Court Optus is arguing that certain of these flexiplans and SPAs are illegal under the anti-discrimination provisions of the current act. Flexiplans are pricing schemes under which, for a flat fee, customers receive discounts on various types of service. For example, for a certain amount per month a residential customer may receive a five per cent discount on all local and STD calls. Strategic partnership arrangements are arrangements between Telecom and large corporate customers under which Telecom provides bulk services at a discount. As dominant carrier in many service markets, Telecom is strictly forbidden to price discriminate in those markets against any person under section 183. At present the only exception is when price differences can be justified on a cost basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally agreed that the intent of the act was not to rule out innovative pricing schemes as such. However, certain anti-discrimination provisions of the act, particularly section 184(3) which appears to rule out the bundling of two or more services, appear to do just that. Both Telecom and Optus offer flexiplan type pricing arrangements, and neither would like to see them all declared illegal. On the other hand, there has been concern that some Telecom flexiplans bundle services where there is competition, such as STD connections, with services in which Telecom is dominant, such as local calls. Clearly only Telecom is in a position to do this. There has also been concern that discounts offered under Telecom SPAs with large corporate customers have not been cost justified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of this matter is a long sorry tale. In November 1992 Optus made representations to Austel claiming that SPAs, and indeed a range of other services, were uncompetitive. Austel immediately took action and held an informal inquiry whereby it consulted extensively with Telecom, Optus, the department and the minister's office from November 1992 until January of the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following these discussions all parties concluded that there were defects in the legislation. Austel also concluded that the legislation did not reflect government policy in relation to innovative pricing or discounting. Yet, despite all of that, despite there being heated agreement on all sides, here we are in May 1994 and this bill is still not through the parliament. A succession of ministers ought to accept at least some responsibility for this, particularly Senator Collins and his then junior minister, who undoubtedly were urged on many occasions to bring this matter to the parliament to ensure that any illegalities that were currently operating were not allowed to continue and that any doubt surrounding the current provisions was resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the current minister, the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), cannot escape liability in this regard either. On the basis of a report in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper it seems that it was only when threats were made&mdash;perhaps in desperation&mdash;that up to half the Telecom board would resign because of fears about their own personal liability that finally the rocket achieved the desired effect and the current minister then finally resolved to take action. That is not a very satisfactory state of affairs. It certainly does not augur too well for someone who described these amendments in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> as being his one bright idea as a minister. Indeed, Louise Dodson of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> describes this as the biggest issue that Mr Lee has so far had to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes undoubtedly have widespread industry support but this is likely to be due to a sense of immense frustration and a continuing desire to resolve the uncertainty as it is a reflection of any inherent confidence in the current proposals. It is, I think, true to say that one cannot ever be certain about the effect of provisions, particularly in this area where the technology is moving very fast, a number of the marketing plans are indeed innovative and have to be tried in the marketplace, and the anti-competitive provisions are still in their infancy in terms of their operation. But, having said all that, I must say that it seems that there has been an inordinate delay. Whilst one can understand that the minister is certainly not wanting to have greatness prematurely thrust upon him, his glacier-like response to these changes does not constitute a very auspicious debut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The language of the minister's second reading speech talks in terms of this being `fine tuning', `removing any doubts', and that `it has become increasingly apparent that a number of tariffs may breach the provisions of the act in a technical but unintended sense'. That, of course, is not news to anyone. That has been known in the industry for something like 12 to 18 months. That is why I think there has been great concern on all sides to finally see these amendments proceed through the chamber as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we were given very little time to consider the effect of these amendments, the opposition did take the opportunity to canvass a number of aspects with the industry. It is on that basis that we do say that there does seem to be widespread support. However, we were concerned that the provision that requires services to be generally available was expressed by the minister to have the intention of also having broad appeal. Whilst I certainly accept that that could have yet another unintended consequence of striking down packages that are targeted at small segments of the customer population, the fact remains that, if there is any doubt in due course and these matters do come up for resolution in the courts, the courts are then entitled to have regard to the minister's second reading speech. I think significant confusion could indeed arise as a result. The minister uses the expression&mdash;and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the following types of discriminatory tariffs will be permitted:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) Those that are generally available; that is, of broad appeal to customers and potential customers.</PARA>
<PARA>The advice that I have received&mdash;and I think this would be the view of Telecom and others&mdash;is that there is a very significant difference between `generally available' and `of broad appeal'. `Broad appeal' could either require a judgment to be made at the beginning as to whether or not packages were likely to be of broad appeal, or it could involve a judgment after the event as to whether there was a high take-up rate. Whichever it is, it still poses particular problems for plans that might be restricted to certain groups, such as particular countries to which there is a large volume of traffic and where it makes sense for Telecom and Optus to provide discounts, certainly on an off-peak basis. Those are generally available, but they may not be of broad appeal, because only a certain segment of the population would be interested, for example, in calling Cambodia on a regular basis. I think the minister ought to at least clarify his understanding of that terminology so that in the event that these matters do come before the courts we are not allowing the courts to proceed on a false basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been described by Peter Leonard, a very respected commentator and, I suppose it should be said, a lawyer acting for Optus in a number of matters&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make the point I do not think anyone would in general terms doubt his objectivity. In this instance I think it is clear if one reads the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Communications</EMPHASIS> that if he does have a partisan view it is very well disguised. Certainly, I think his long track record in the industry is one that has earned him considerable respect. He describes these as the most fundamental changes to telecommunications regulations since the current regime began. He says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government states the Amendment Bill is intended to . . . `remove any doubt that a dominant carrier can offer certain charging options which would otherwise be discriminatory and hence in breach of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Telecommunications Act</EMPHASIS>.'</PARA>
<PARA>As I have already indicated, that is a marked understatement. The fact is there is not only doubt but there seems to be a general belief that current arrangements are illegal and therefore there needs to be not just some minor clarification or fine tuning, but careful and specific changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the minister's claim that his one bright idea involves a movement away from `black letter' law to vesting Austel with a much broader degree of discretion is, in itself, an admission that these are very fundamental changes and will, of course, require that Austel has the necessary resources. It is now given more time in which to make these judgments on tariffs. Perhaps one of the most significant changes of all is that it can, after the event, disallow new tariff provisions. Its general power under section 46 of the current act would allow it to make random checks on specific tariff arrangements. All of that should at least help to ensure that no-one is tempted to go beyond the bounds of the legislation and should certainly enable Austel to exercise its powers comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives Austel the power to disallow tariffs filed by a dominant carrier which materially and adversely affect the development and/or maintenance of commercially sustainable competition. That is not a provision that is in line with the Trade Practices Act approach. It is clearly a tougher test&mdash;deliberately so and, I think, rightly so. That is an overarching power that will need to be exercised with care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme of the act allows discrimination in several circumstances, as I have previously indicated, such as under tariffs that are generally available. Again, I stress that Peter Leonard points out that the tariff must be a broad appeal to customers and potential customers. So once again we have people proceeding on a basis which may cause considerable difficulties down the track. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I turn to the case of a tariff which is not generally available but in respect of which exceptions are able to be made. The tariff is now allowed if permitted by Austel and if it is not anti-competitive. Austel may allow discrimination in three cases: one, if justified by cost differences&mdash;as I understand it, that is likely to be the route that would enable the resurrection of SPA type arrangements in due course&mdash;secondly, `if justified by community interest in promotion of universal service availability at reasonable cost'; and, third, `if justifiable as a trial, pilot program or demonstration'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel is not required to immediately review existing tariffs. An exempt tariff must still be subject to scrutiny and disallowance by Austel because of its anti-competitive effect. That is where this tougher test, which is deliberately different from the provisions of the Trade Practices Act, would come into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also enable the minister to give directions as to how Austel is to perform its functions. Austel will be required to follow draft ministerial directions which can be disallowed by the parliament. Austel will be required to promptly undertake a comprehensive review in relation to bundled tariffs, particularly SPAs and flexiplans, which calculate discounts based on the usage of two or more services. This has been a vexed area and one that I think is in need of urgent attention. Clearly, the intention of the legislation is that there should be a higher degree of transparency where a carrier provides a service exclusively, such as Telecom providing local calls. A company should not be in a position to bundle that in with other competitive services and thereby provide a combination which its competitor cannot compete against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the minister says that it is government policy that a carrier who is in a position to dominate a market should not be permitted to bundle telecommunication services where that conduct is anti-competitive. On the face of it, that leaves open the possibility that services can be bundled where the conduct is competitive. Where there is only one carrier providing a service, it clearly is intended that that should be regarded as anti-competitive. The sooner Austel ensures that that situation does not arise the better. As I understand it, the carriers are likely to file general tariffs that will allow an objective assessment of the true cost of each individual service rather than bundling them, as has happened in the past. I think that will be a great step forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports these amendments without any further need for amendments. We very much trust that the new regime will be successful and that Austel will have the resources to exercise its watchdog role fearlessly and impartially. Clearly, it is operating in untested waters where there are very significant interests and very large costs involved in investments. In those circumstances, it is absolutely imperative that the regulator be fearlessly impartial and certainly facilitate the growth of competition in this dynamic area. If it is allowed to do that, and we do not have any more of the dilatory behaviour and procrastination that we have seen in bringing these amendments forward, hopefully litigation of any sort will be kept to a minimum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will be supporting the Australian Telecommunications Amendment Bill. We believe that it strikes the right balance between allowing Telecom to offer innovative discount schemes on the one hand, while preventing it from using its dominant market position to prevent competition on the other. There seems to be little argument that provisions of the Telecommunications Act 1991 have unintentionally put Telecom's price discount schemes&mdash;for instance, flexiplans&mdash;in legal doubt. Furthermore, at the moment accusations by Telecom's competitors that a particular scheme is anti-competitive can be resolved only by the courts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aim of this bill is to provide a better definition of an anti-competitive discount tariff to prevent Telecom from using discount schemes to lock its competitors out of certain markets, and to transfer jurisdiction over disputes from the courts to Austel. The immediate practical implications for Telecom's current discount schemes is that those which are generally available, such as flexiplans, will continue. Schemes available to only narrow sectors of the business or residential markets will not be allowed. The strategic partnership arrangements between Telecom and large business customers will have difficulty meeting the approval criteria in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill allows a discount tariff to be offered by a dominant carrier if it meets one of two tests. The first is that it must be generally available to business or residential customers, or both. Austel may determine a subclass of business or residential customers to whom the discount must be generally available. The second is that it may be permitted by Austel if it reflects differences in the costs of providing services, or is in the community interest, or is part of a trial program. However, if either of these tests are met, Austel may still disallow the tariff on anti-competitive grounds. It is a belts and braces approach which should contribute to commercially sustainable competition in the telecommunications market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was pleased to hear that the opposition will not be proceeding with the amendment moved in the House of Representatives. That amendment required discount schemes not only to be generally available, but to be of broad appeal. The Democrats believe that this would create serious legal doubts about what we would regard as legitimate discount schemes offered by Telecom. I am glad to hear that the opposition regards them so as well. It is also unnecessary, given the breadth of Austel's new disallowance power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that no-one in the industry has contacted us with any significant concerns about this bill. In fact, no-one has come to us with any concerns about the bill at all. I was very surprised to read in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that Senator Alston was considering moving for a committee inquiry into this bill. I congratulate him on apparently changing his mind. The Democrats believe that the bill is constructive and sensible, and we will be supporting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also rise to speak to support the Telecommunications Amendment Bill 1994, which amends the Telecommunications Act 1991 to relax prohibitions on price discrimination and to allow the regulator, Austel, to test telecommunications tariffs for anti-competitive effect. The amendments serve to remove two problems from the current telecommunications legislation. The first issue deals with the apparent illegality of various pricing options introduced by both Telecom and Optus. The most important of these has been the Telecom flexiplan and strategic partnership arrangements entered into with Telecom customers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Federal Court, Optus has raised concerns that some of these arrangements may be discriminatory and are therefore illegal. This amendment comes into effect retrospectively on 15 March, and this retrospectivity was necessary to alert the industry to the coming changes but will not affect any of the court actions undertaken before 15 March. Flexiplans and strategic partnership arrangements are competitive, but could be seen to be unfair under the current act, and neither Telecom nor Optus wants to see pricing schemes declared illegal. The carriers just want to operate under equal circumstances. We believe that this bill goes a long way towards bringing that about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two main schemes are flexiplan and strategic partnership. The flexiplans are pricing schemes under which, for a flat fee, customers receive discounts on various types of service. An example of this is small discounts that residential customers can receive on both local and STD calls. The strategic partnership arrangements are agreements between Telecom and large corporate customers under which Telecom provides bulk services at a discount. As Telecom is the dominant carrier, many of the services that are provided are therefore given an advantage by Telecom but, under the act as it currently exists, it is strictly forbidden to discriminate as to price in those markets against any person. The only exception is when the price differences can be justified on the basis of cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All interested parties agree that the Telecommunications Act, as it was originally drafted, was not intended to disallow innovative pricing offers to customers. However, it appears that the act does stop the bundling together of two or more services. As both Optus and Telecom offer flexiplan arrangements, neither wants to see them declared illegal. However, clearly, only Telecom can offer both STD and local calls, and some current strategic partnerships may not be justified as to cost. Accordingly, the bill addresses these two problems by removing ambiguous anti-discrimination provisions in the act and broadens the carriers' rights to discriminate as to price. Anti-bundling provisions are also removed from the principal act. </PARA>

Austel can decide that this discrimination is permitted on the basis of only three things. The first is that there are significant cost differences borne by the carrier in relation to the discrimination; so it is not so much on the customer as back on the carrier.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its support for the Telecommunications Amendment Bill, which seeks to correct a number of problems and which can be referred to as finetuning of the legislation. I was interested to hear some of the comments made by Senator Alston during the debate about the delay in getting the legislation into parliament. One of the reasons for that necessary delay was that, certainly during the time I was minister in charge of that portfolio, highly conflicting legal advice was received by the government in respect of how this matter should be resolved. In addition, the government quite properly desired to ensure that the most exhaustive consultation was carried out with the industry in terms of getting these amendments carried.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, a number of the concerns industry had in respect of this longstanding issue were raised with the government only late last year, as Minister Lee advised the House of Representatives. I was curious but not surprised to hear Senator Alston's comments about his concerns over the certainty of the wording in the amending legislation and the need for clarity. There is no question as far as the government is concerned that the wording of the bill, the explanatory memorandum and indeed the minister's own comments in the second reading speech have made it abundantly clear what the government intends by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of what Senator Alston had to say, I comment&mdash;I think in the same way as Senator Bourne commented&mdash;that I find it passing strange that someone who was so concerned about clarity would have been proposing to introduce an amendment to this legislation, which I am relieved to see Senator Alston did not do in the Senate, that would have added to the legislation an unnecessary set of words in connection with broad public appeal. They would, I have no doubt, have enriched entire generations of lawyers not yet born. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to conclude by saying one thing. I do not want to delay the Senate unduly but this should be put on the record: it is abundantly clear at this stage that the radical, indeed far-reaching, reforms in telecommunications that this government put into place in 1991 have proved to be outstandingly successful. I feel that I should place this on the record as there was no acknowledgment of it by any member of the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The objective of these changes was to improve telecommunications services and to reduce costs to consumers, both residential and business. Even in this comparatively early stage of that process, the results have been impressive. There have been, as all honourable senators would know, significant decreases in prices across the board following these changes. Both business and residential customers are now benefiting significantly from the changes that were introduced by this government. For example, very briefly, the cost of a five-minute call between Sydney and Melbourne at peak rates has fallen by almost 20 per cent&mdash;the exact figure is 18.5 per cent&mdash;and the cost of a five-minute international call at peak rates from Australia to the United States fell by 12.7 per cent in the 12 months to 30 June last year. </PARA>

All of those have now been introduced, to the great benefit of consumers in the Australian market. The government can fairly say, with some satisfaction, that the policy direction, the policy objectives of these changes when they were introduced in 1991, has already been substantially met. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the debate and for their support of the legislation. </PARA>

It comes at the request of the Northern Territory government and with the support of both the Aboriginal community concerned and Gambamora Industries Pty Ltd, the adjoining land-holder. The bill relates to a parcel of land in the Wave Hill area which is to be granted to the relevant land trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this land was part of a claim made for a much larger area of land but that claim was unsuccessful at the time. A claim was then made for the smaller area as in this legislation. The land has never been the subject of a pastoral lease; I can assure honourable senators of that. I was in that very vicinity only last week. It is dry; it is arid; it is vacant crown land. As part of the agreement amongst all parties concerning this claim, it was agreed that the Northern Territory government would request the Commonwealth to grant the claimed area to the traditional owners by scheduling the area under the principal act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is therefore happy to support the bill.

It is a distance of some 400 kilometres. It will be very important for this new land claim situation. At present, no-one seems to want to take responsibility for the road. It is not the responsibility of the main roads department of Western Australia, I might add. I believe it is a responsibility of the federal government. It is a disgrace. It has been used by a number of exploration people and by Aboriginal people travelling backwards and forwards. For safety and for commerce, I believe this federal government should find some money for it. On behalf of the opposition, the bill is not contentious and we support its passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am also pleased to support this legislation, but I would like to take the opportunity to address a number of issues that arise from it. The principle of this bill has been agreed upon by all parties, especially the Northern Territory government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look generally at the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, it is very obvious that this act is now the odd one out in Australia. The rest of the country has the Native Title Act applying, whereas in the Northern Territory there are now two Aboriginal land regimes. Of course, this raises confusion about which law applies. We have heard the rumour that the Commonwealth will legislate to make the Aboriginal land rights act paramount. That may not be what some Aboriginal groups want, of course. It will reinforce the land councils' power base in the Northern Territory, and that raises some very important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has recently been addressed by a solicitor in the Northern Territory, who has looked at the consistencies and inconsistencies and problems that arise between the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1994 and the recently passed Native Title Act.

I have passed to the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), who is at the table, a copy of this paper. I seek leave of the Senate to table that document. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6E4">Senator TAMBLING</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister. The Northern Territory government remains concerned at matters that create difficulty with land administration as well as being inconsistent with the Native Title Act, and I would like to refer to a number of matters in this regard. The first relates to the veto on mining exploration, the right of consent. The second relates to the compulsory acquisition powers for essential services&mdash;for example, where acquisition is less than freehold, where it could be for named purposes only, where land councils peddle the line that the Northern Territory government would resume large areas for no particular purpose. Thirdly, the application of Northern Territory laws needs clarification&mdash;for example, on erosion control, stock diseases and quarantine, bushfire provisions and fencing laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth matter relates to the ability to claim public facilities&mdash;for example, research farms and cattle yards, as well as land set aside for public purposes such as quarantine reserves. Fifthly, public rights of access are removed when land is converted&mdash;for example, rivers and beaches. The Nhulunbuy residents in the Northern Territory must pay $60 per annum to go to the beach in that area. Finally, there are others matters such as the conversion of pastoral leases. The Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account at its last meeting agreed to seek the consent of the minister to apply the full amount of its reserves, $20 million, to the purchase and conversion of Northern Territory pastoral leases. I will come back to that issue towards the end of my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been pleased to note that the Northern Territory government announced some time ago that it would try to settle outstanding land claims by negotiation. This bill is the result of one such negotiation. It reminds us that the original interpretations of the Aboriginal Land Rights Act did not envisage repeat claims&mdash;that is, the refusal to accept the umpire's decision so that large tracts of the Northern Territory are frozen from land administration even after the land commissioner has found that a claim is not supportable. However, repeat claims are now the law and, despite hardship to individuals affected&mdash;and there have been a number of them in the Northern Territory&mdash;and government difficulty with administration, the Northern Territory government is doing its best to resolve as many as possible. I am pleased to note that in the context of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report on the economic effects of land rights in the Northern Territory was brought down in December 1993 by the Centre for International Economics. That paper addressed a whole range of issues. Perhaps I should summarise the contents of that document in relation to mining and exploration that are crucial to the economy; how Mabo could affect exploration and mining; the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act; the effects of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act with regard to prospectivity and exploration; and an estimate of the effects of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act on the Northern Territory economy. The report set out in detail an economic model of the effect of increased mineral production; the lost income in the past; and the effects that could possibly arise in the future. I commend a study of that report by the Centre for International Economics to anybody vitally interested in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should also refer to the expectations and representations of a number of Aboriginal people with regard to any changes to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. Back in late January of this year, there was a very disconcerting report in the Northern Territory media when Mr Darryl Pearce, the Director of the Northern Land Council, said that Australia may face a situation like Bougainville. He said that Aborigines would use the social justice package negotiations to lobby either for changes to the native title legislation or for the package to somehow address the matter. We all know that the negotiations on the social justice package have been deferred by the government to next year. At that time Mr Pearce also said, `Civil unrest is inevitable if people are denied rights.' I find that totally unacceptable. There is a veiled threat there of a connection with Bougainville. It is totally unacceptable. It was provocative and unnecessary. I hope part of the negotiation on legislation such as this will prove that, by negotiation, issues can be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, the Australian Labor Party in the Northern Territory is taking a very ironic and rather equivocal position at the moment. In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Northern Territory News</EMPHASIS> an article appeared under the heading `Ede: We'll change Land Rights Act'. Ede is the leader of the opposition in the Northern Territory. The first few paragraphs of that report read:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Territory Opposition Leader Brian Ede said yesterday a Labor government in the NT would move to change the Land Rights Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said the changes would `take the prescriptive measures', or excessive red tape, out of the mining provisions in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ede was speaking at yesterday's ALP mines and energy policy launch.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important statement, and it is rather ironic because several weeks ago the Labor Party in the Northern Territory also released the territory Labor strategy for Aboriginal territorians. Again I seek to table this document. I have passed a copy to the minister; I hope by the end of my speech she will have been able to agree to the incorporation of that document also. Contained in the Northern Territory Labor Party commitment are two very interesting issues. They state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursue amendments to the Northern Territory Land Rights Act including Part IV (the mining section) that will result in a substantial freeing up of the overly bureaucratic regulations affecting mining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pursue amendments to the Northern Territory Aboriginal Land Rights Act to allow long-term leasing of land which will allow acquisition of land for public and commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If that is the Labor Party policy and it has been known for quite some time, why is it not incorporated in this bill? Why has the Labor Party not chosen to present as part of this legislation what is obviously the gospel of the Labor Party&mdash;good, commonsense provisions, picking up issues for which the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory has been arguing for some time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears to me that the ALP in the Northern Territory is copycatting&mdash;and I am pleased to say it is copycatting&mdash;those provisions that are acceptable to the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory. But Mr Ede has not been able to convince his colleagues in this chamber, in this parliament, in the federal Labor Party. Why is Mr Tickner not proposing that as part of the amendments to this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill passed through the House of Representatives on 3 May, and I wish to refer particularly to the speech in that place by Mr Warren Snowdon, the federal Labor Party member for the Northern Territory. Parts of that speech show the paranoia Mr Snowdon has concerning this issue and the extremism of the agenda of the left wing of the Labor Party when it comes to land rights. A lot of what is reflected in Mr Snowdon's speech is not in the interests of all territorians whom he represents, and certainly is not in the interests of all territorian Aborigines whom he represents; rather, it is in the interests of that clique of Aboriginal powerbrokers who obviously have a lot of sway over Mr Tickner, Mr Snowdon and a number of others. Mr Snowdon was having a shot at me when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the campaigns which have been waged successfully over the years by the Northern Territory Country Liberal Party, the partners in crime to the National Party of Australia, principally, and to the Liberal Party of Australia&mdash;and to the CLP senator from the Northern Territory who sits with the National Party in the Senate&mdash;they have consistently waged what often have been overtly racist campaigns against the interests and rights of Aboriginal people as they have been expounded under the Northern Territory land rights act.</PARA>
<PARA>I totally reject that statement. It is very interesting to note that Mr Snowdon does not cite any particular example to back up his fundamentally wrong statement. It is always easy to utter throwaway lines, to `presume' and to talk about interests and rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make no apology whatsoever for exposing those examples of nepotism, corruption and mismanagement in the portfolio of Aboriginal affairs in this Senate, in the Senate estimates committee, in the media or anywhere else. I do that in the interests of my territory Aboriginal constituency, and I will continue to do it. I will say fundamentally that a crook is a crook is a crook, a black crook is no different from a white crook, and it is not racist to expose any crook at any particular time. A lot of those crooks, I have to say, are unfortunately too close to the Labor government in many parts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further in his speech, Mr Snowdon took a swipe at the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory for standing up on many issues. I ask: who should speak out for all territorians, other than the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory? He has an obligation to speak for all territorians, including the 25 per cent of the constituency who happen to be Aboriginals. Because Mr Perron does speak out without fear or favour on issues such as this, he ought not to be castigated or criticised by some left wing member of the Labor Party who has a particular agenda on issues of indigenous rights. There is a very important principle here for all of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note, again in today's media in the Northern Territory, that Mr Perron is quoted as raising a number of issues. Under the heading `Perron: Check Black land rush,' there is an article which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chief Minister Marshall Perron urged the Federal Government yesterday to forestall what he called an Aboriginal land rush in the Territory under the proposed Mabo land acquisition fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a letter to Prime Minister Paul Keating, Mr Perron said `an absolute minimum' of NT land should be bought using the fund because millions of dollars already had been spent buying land for NT Aborigines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Perron also said he was alarmed at information he had received showing NT land councils intended to spend $20 million from another source&mdash;mining royalty equivalents&mdash;to buy up pastoral properties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is the very same issue that I have been talking about in this chamber and in the estimates committee throughout 1993. I refer very specifically to the Aboriginal Benefits Trust account, which accumulates the mining royalty equivalents&mdash;the proper property of Aboriginal people. Last year two reports to ATSIC by the professional firm of Walter and Turnbull were tabled in the Senate, and they exposed a great deal of mismanagement of $20 or $30 million of funds. That money was the property of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory and was misused under the regime of a couple of people on an advisory committee to the Aboriginal Benefits Trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Walter and Turnbull reports very specifically made a number of recommendations with regard to the maintenance of that fund and the important capital component of it. Yet we now get the suggestions coming forward that the remaining $20 million ought to be corrupted further. Obviously one way to do it is to get rid of the fund entirely by purchasing properties. I would find that to be a criminal action, and I say that unequivocally. If the government and the minister accede to that, they will not be looking after the interests of all territory Aborigines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises very serious issues. Arising from the Walter and Turnbull reports last year was the subsequent report to the parliament by the Auditor-General in December of last year which addressed the administration of the Northern Land Council. That report found it necessary to make some 52 recommendations for change in the land council administration. Yet we see now another backdoor deal being done by the Minister, Mr Tickner. It is not surprising, therefore, that my colleague the shadow minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, Mr Peter Nugent, made a statement earlier this week as to why we in the coalition have taken a principled position on why a land fund is not necessary. It is a very important issue, and it raises very serious matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress again that what is being proposed by the government is not in the interests of Aboriginal people throughout Australia. If anyone likes to go back and look very carefully through all the details of the Walter and Turnbull reports and the Auditor-General's report of last year&mdash;and I would invite the media to go through them&mdash;they would see the potential for problems to arise with the development of a specific land acquisition fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill before us today does deserve support and I am pleased to indicate that we are supporting it. It raises a whole range of issues that are very fundamental. I would again refer the Senate to the paper by Peter Walker, which I trust the minister will approve me tabling in this parliament. I would also commend for reference the ALP Northern Territory policy statement on Aborigines. Both of these must be carefully studied in the context of any amendments to the Aboriginal land rights act. This is a welcome amendment, but a lot of others that were promised by Mr Holding, Mr Hand and Mr Tickner have not surfaced. A series of other amendments that have been promised in recent years did not surface with this. The Labor Party has not honoured its commitment in its new platform in the Northern Territory to bring in issues that its members are out touting in the media but do not have the courage to bring in here and add to this legislation.

What Senator Tambling has done is raise a few issues here, some of which are very important, some of which go very close to accusations that are the sorts of things honourable senators would be much more careful about if they were not in parliament. I will certainly make sure that my colleagues have Senator Tambling's speech drawn to their attention for two reasons: firstly, to make sure that the points of substance raised by Senator Tambling are thoroughly examined and looked at; and, secondly, so that the points of criticism might also be treated with the same kind of concern.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before Senator Hill starts to get cheeky about anything in the government's policy, I think it would be useful to remind ourselves about some of the contributions he would have made to the unemployed under his party's Fightback policy. Some $790 million worth of savings, as I recall, were to be achieved at the expense of the unemployed. Fightback would have reduced spending on labour market programs by one-quarter, as I recall.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator McMullan and everyone else for their help in this matter but I had finished making the points I wanted to make. I intended to go on to say that the white paper is not about creating jobs for jobs sake or non jobs or artificial jobs or temporary jobs. The white paper is about creating real jobs&mdash;indeed, 1 1/2 million of them at least by the turn of the century, by the year 2001. The reason that will happen is that the white paper is not only about social policy; it is about economic policy. It is not only about equity; it is about economics. It is not only about training; it is about the implications of that training for the creation of new jobs over a period of time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If those opposite knew anything about economics, not to mention anything else, they would appreciate the significance of these particular proposals in that context. Bringing the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, and the possibly unemployable, back into the work force with enhanced skill levels and enhanced employability makes a direct contribution to growth in the economy as a whole. Having a bigger pool of trained and motivated human resources increases business investment and business decision making options. Investments can be made, new business activities can be undertaken which might otherwise go offshore or would require products to be imported rather than produced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the functional equivalent of skilled migration. The economic contribution to the work force of skilled migrants has never been underappreciated or misunderstood, and that is what is being done by training and creating a new capacity to contribute to the economy with people who might otherwise have totally lost that capacity if they had been left to themselves by the kinds of policies that Senator Hill is so strongly advocating.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reducing unemployment is essential in itself to achieving sustained and stronger growth because it harnesses the productive potential of the unemployed, which is otherwise lost, because having a pool of job-ready and better skilled workers prevents the re-emergence&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am answering that question by saying that of course we have not given up on that goal. And, of course, every element of this white paper&mdash;not just the social policy dimensions of it but the economic policy dimensions of it&mdash;is directed explicitly to achieving that particular goal, not just by meeting the equity needs of those who will otherwise become a kind of depressed underclass but by meeting the economic needs of the nation. No point is worth making more strongly than that in the context of replying to that kind of question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude on that point by saying that having a pool of job-ready and better skilled workers of the kind that will be produced by this particular paper has an economic significance in addition to those I have mentioned already by preventing the re-emergence of inflationary pressures that would otherwise inhibit strong and sustained growth. It helps increase national savings by reducing budget outlays and increasing income tax revenue, which again implies lower budget deficits, which again is a major contribution to macro-economic objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to all the other specific initiatives in the white paper which will assist investment decisions to be made&mdash;and if I had the time I would go through them: the cut in the tax rate for the pooled development funds; the change in the tax treatment of infrastructure bonds; the funding for capital works projects; the regional headquarters; the trade policy matters; all of that kind&mdash;in addition to all those other measures which are directly and sharply targeted towards improving the viability of investment decisions, and in addition to all the other initiatives which we have introduced over the last few years and have created the conditions in the economy which exist at the moment for enhanced business activity, with these training measures one has something that is of a very direct and immediate economic significance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I might press it further because there seems to have been a lapse of memory on the part of the minister since yesterday. The green paper referred to full employment. Chifley's white paper referred to full employment. Yesterday, the minister said that full employment in the Labor government's terms is about five per cent unemployment or approximately half a million unemployed&mdash;half a million unemployed being a satisfactory goal. How does the government, therefore, justify that new goal that relegates so many Australians to the scrap heap of unemployment, in the light of Chifley's advice 50 years ago?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course the objective remains to create a situation where everybody who wants a job can get one. Of course that is the objective of every government in every country in the world. The question is: in this day and age, given the current organisation of economies like ours, what is an achievable one on the best possible assumptions about appropriate job conditions, appropriate employment and economic conditions and appropriate government strategies to maximise the chances of getting that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economists' views about that, as I said yesterday, differ quite a lot. But there is a realism about the sense in which one does have to target in this day and age less than the one per cent or two per cent figures that were common as assessments of achievable full employment in societies like ours a generation ago. Nowhere in the world are assessments of that being achievable being made by any other country like our own&mdash;in the OECD or anywhere else. So it is a matter of understanding what the objective is, working like hell to try to achieve that objective, and putting in place policies which, unlike the opposition's, will get us one hell of a lot closer to that objective than anything the opposition would be able to manage or would even care to try doing.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology relates to a particular factor necessary to ensure the success of some of the initiatives in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Working Nation: the White Paper on Employment and Growth</EMPHASIS>. Is it a fact that access to finance is the basis of growth for businesses, underpinning innovation, enabling new technology to be harnessed and allowing new markets to be exploited?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to pick up where my colleague and leader, Senator Evans, left off and make the point that the economic settings in the macro economy for Australia are very positive for investment. We do have a high level of growth compared with OECD countries&mdash;the four per cent estimated by Westpac this year is going to five per cent; we have a low level of inflation of 1.4 per cent; we have attractive interest rates; we have a high and record profit share; we have low levels of industrial disputation; and, importantly, we have increasing competitiveness in the Australian economy. We are a going, ticking over affair and we are a good site for investment. That is underpinned by a burgeoning export performance in the world, specifically for elaborately transformed manufactures and sophisticated services in the Asia-Pacific market.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several signs of investment pick-up in Australia, the most recent being the ACCI-Westpac index on capacity utilisation. If one looks closely at yesterday's balance of payments figures one will see that there is a pick-up in investment in plant and equipment, automatic data processing and transport which will underpin a greater productive capacity by Australian companies. The economy is still heading towards fulfilling its full capacity limits as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am asked in this question about access to finance for small to medium business. Senator McMullan is well placed to talk about access to finance for export. I will leave that area to him, but a number of exciting initiatives have emanated from him in his portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the portfolio of industry, science and technology, the white paper set out yesterday a number of new things in the area of access to finance for small to medium business. If one looks at the retorts and responses from the industry organisations, the business councils and the employer groups around Australia as to how they see these measures, one will see there is a unanimity of view with approval and support for these measures. They are heralded as well-targeted, well-timed and necessary, and will underpin the competitiveness of Australian industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the pooled development funds that Senator Evans referred to a moment ago. The tax rate for those funds has been reduced to 15 per cent for investment in small to medium enterprises; infrastructure bonds have been modified in their tax treatment&mdash;they have been extended across a range of areas and they will, indeed, fund important capital works in this country. In addition, I mention the exciting new program we are establishing with the chambers of manufactures around Australia, a business angels-type program to enable would-be investors to meet investment vehicles in small to medium companies and, with the chambers of manufactures, lift their levels of investment and equity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regional headquarters initiative has abolished the dividend withholding tax across the board and provided a write-off for the transposing to Australia of necessary plant and equipment and location expenses, as well as an attractive series of reasons why international companies should now locate their regional headquarters in this country. We have removed the training guarantee levy for two years, and that has been hailed as an important incentive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When these things are put alongside a very low company tax rate in Australia, and we take into account the fact that economic recovery is now pushing the economy closer to its capacity limits, one expects that the signs of increased investment will pick up even further. That is good news for all of us. It is certainly good news for Australia and, importantly, good news for the unemployed. It is also good news for those in industry who will lead the charge in creating the jobs that are necessary.</PARA>

There is a cut in the tax rate for pooled development funds from 25 per cent to 15 per cent on the income derived from investments in small and medium-sized enterprises and the easing of the operating restrictions on those funds. There is a modification of the tax treatment in infrastructure bonds by, in effect, giving investors the option of a 33 per cent tax break to encourage private sector investment in infrastructure with an extension of eligibility in the area of aviation, electricity, gas and water facilities. There is funding for some specific capital works projects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the promotion of international linkages, not only domestically through the regional headquarters program but through a whole raft of policy initiatives in the trade and foreign affairs portfolio, including new posts in Kazakhstan, Ho Chi Minh City, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong, Jakarta and Kuala Lumpur. There are new investment promotion jobs identified and located in the United States and Singapore, more resources in Hong Kong and New York, a special investment representative to lead investment missions to Asia and America, the international trade enhancement scheme, an extended EMDG scheme&mdash;all ways that are designed to generate more exports and, as a result of those more exports, more growth in the domestic economy and more jobs flowing from that growth. That is the equation that this government has been about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite have never begun to understand the nexus between exports and growth and jobs. That is the way it is happening. We are building on an environment where we have a company tax rate of 33 per cent compared with the coalition's at 42 per cent. We have rapidly enhanced depreciation arrangements. We have a massive program of micro-economic reform involving deregulatory measures, tariff reductions and industrial relations measures which have led to fewer disputes than in the last 42 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a whole raft of industry specific measures, all creating an environment where profit share now is the highest that it has ever been in this nation's history, where interest rates are at their lowest level for 20 years, where inflation is way under two per cent and totally under control, where there have been solid gains in productivity and a 30 per cent increase in competitiveness over the last 10 years, where there is ample evidence of a pick-up in consumer confidence and demand, and where that confidence is at the highest level it has been for a decade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In essence, what the initiatives in the paper say about trade is that we have come a long way but we need to go further. In trade terms, the white paper comes forward in a context in which, over the last decade, we have made enormous strides in expanding and diversifying our economy and our international trade presence. A lot has been done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at a few of the statistics. There are hundreds of them. For example, exports of goods and services have grown from 14 per cent of GDP to over 20 per cent and elaborately transformed manufactures have risen from 11 per cent of exports to 21 per cent. There is rapid growth in services exports as well. All those things are pluses, significant advances that have been made in the last decade as a result of the reforms of the government. The statistics cannot adequately portray the growing export culture. We are confident it is taking hold in Australian industry. Having made those strides already, we need to proceed to the next steps. The last thing we can afford to be is complacent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next steps that we have outlined in this successful process of transformation are very practical measures about helping Australian business to get out into the international marketplace and do business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several key and very important messages and initiatives which have very tangible, practical and measurable benefits. An example is the continuation of the export market development grant for a further five years and its extension to tourism in particular. The EMDG has been a very effective mechanism for getting Australian businesses into export. Typically&mdash;and the statistics indicate it&mdash;mature exporters will generate in additional exports, 15 to 25 times the grant paid to them. That is, 15 to 25 times the taxpayers' outlays flow in increased exports. Similarly, in the international trade enhancement scheme the multiple is about 18&mdash;18 times the funds loaned to exporters will be returned in a net increase in foreign exchange earnings for Australia. These are very valuable financing facilities to companies and are welcomed by the private sector. The scheme has been extended for a further four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also had a significant extension of Austrade and the global trade support network so that Australian businesses going out to seek new markets, or to build on the markets they already have, will have the maximum assistance the Australian government is capable of providing particularly, but not only, in this region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also recognised in the white paper the need to build on the interconnection between developing industry capability to world best practice, which is principally the responsibility of my colleague Senator Cook, and the capture of export opportunities through trade intelligence, export facilitation and trade promotion.

The jobs compact is a welcome step forward for some, but in last year's budget the Prime Minister said to the long-term employed, `Sorry, you will have to wait for growth.' What is the answer today? It is, `Don't worry, rely on growth.' Is it not a shaky assumption to base the government's five per cent unemployment target on growth alone? Also, given the fact that in the past three years employment in larger businesses has fallen by more than 300,000 while, at the same time, small business has demonstrated a greater capacity to deliver real jobs by growth of more than 136,000 jobs, why did the government not do more in this white paper to acknowledge the special role of small business in generating the real jobs we are talking about? These are the ones the government keeps talking about but that we cannot find in the white paper.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot does not seem to have been listening to the very first answer I gave, which was designed, among other things, to directly answer that proposition. We are not relying simply on some kind of natural underlying growth which would occur in the absence of any particular government strategy designed to secure additional rates of growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We certainly believe that, on the basis of the condition of the Australian economy now, after all the things we have done to move things along, and as a result of the condition of the international economy, we can reasonably expect, for the immediately foreseeable future, the present Australian growth rate, the highest in the OECD, to continue at around four per cent. This would, in itself, hopefully, add over 200,000 jobs a year, just as it has in the last 12 months. But the point that I have been making is that there are additional strategies in this white paper to create the very real jobs&mdash;or new jobs, if you like&mdash;that Senator Kernot is referring to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only are there the additional incentives for investment that I have already mentioned and will not repeat again in terms of the infrastructure tax breaks and things of that particular kind, but also the very act of moving down the path spelt out in the jobs compact, the very act of creating new skills, new confidence and new employability in that huge class of long-term unemployed at the moment will itself be a direct contribution to, in the slightly longer term&mdash;over the next two-, three-, four-year period; not directly and immediately&mdash;the creation of new jobs. This is simply because there will be new skills on which businesses can draw to rely upon in making new business decisions, which otherwise they would not be able to do with that particular pool of skills not being available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Plus, there is the additional contribution to the economy that is made in turn as each one of these people comes into the job market who would otherwise be excluded from it and would simply be sitting out on the sidelines as an underclass receiving, in perpetuity, unemployment or other social security benefits. So the economy itself is benefiting from the creation of new skills and new capability. Moreover, most of these job compact strategies that are set out in the white paper are very directly targeted to the needs of small and medium sized businesses in terms of the encouragement that is being given to them through the subsidies and case management strategies that are spelt out to employ people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not just employment on some sort of temporary basis on the slave labour wages that the opposition would have had us embrace with its particular so-called training wage, which is totally different from this strategy. There are incentives built into this for small and medium enterprises to take people on&mdash;initially, on a temporary basis, yes, while their skills are being built up&mdash;but hopefully on a basis which will result in sustained employment in those enterprises on a basis that is attractive for those particular enterprises. That is the strategy which runs right through this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat: it is not just a social justice or equity strategy&mdash;as useful, viable, attractive and necessary as that is, and as unheard of on the other side of politics as it is. There is a real, hard-edged economic strategy, job creation strategy, built into the very fabric of this white paper. For Senator Kernot and the representatives of youth unemployed, or anyone else in the press who has missed the point about that, we cannot go on making that point too often. It is about employment and growth. It is about new jobs, new growth; not just the growth that is otherwise there. That is why it is a policy paper that deserves to be embraced with the applause that it has received.</PARA>

We have said what we think is good about the paper&mdash;it has not been universally condemned&mdash;but the strategy the minister is talking about for small business is a minimalist one. The government's strategy is to encourage training. The minister says that it is good to train bank managers to be kinder to small business. The government had the opportunity to do something more meaningful for owners by saying, `We'll do something about access to finance.' Small businesses often have to borrow money to pay their provisional tax. Why has the government not chosen to do something more substantial now?

The situation in Rwanda is now well and truly spinning out of control with violent loss of life on a scale not seen since the horrors of Cambodia. Is it not time now to move beyond a simple peacekeeping exercise proposed by the United Nations to a more interventionist peace enforcement operation? What is the Australian government going to do?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whatever our other disagreements in this place might be, I am sure all honourable senators will agree with me that the humanitarian catastrophe in Rwanda is horrifying. The country is in chaos, with perhaps 200,000 people already killed&mdash;maybe rather more than that&mdash;many thousands wounded and more than a million people forced to flee their homes as a result of the intertribal violence between the Hutu and the Tutsi and other related civil strife.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Efforts to re-open peace talks are continuing. These include attempts by the UN mission in Rwanda to broker a cease-fire and attempts by the Tanzanian government to reconvene talks at Arusha between the warring parties. Also, the United States is actively encouraging diplomatic efforts to press the parties to stop fighting. It is sending a high level team to investigate the situation and attempt to mediate a settlement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is of course: what is the international community to do if the killing continues, if the diplomatic efforts, these mediation efforts, prove as unsuccessful as they have to date? The UN Secretary-General has been active. In the first place, he has asked the Organisation of African Unity, the OAU, and some African countries whether they would be prepared to make troops available for a regional effort to actually restore law and order in Rwanda. So far, those efforts do not seem to have borne fruit.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The UN Security Council, at the Secretary-General's request, has also been considering the situation. While the decision was first made to cut the size of the UN Assistance Mission in Rwanda, UNAMIR, simply because it was a differently constructed mission with a different kind of peacekeeping mandate which was obviously unsustainable at the time in the changed circumstances, the Security Council, as a result of this change of circumstance, is now willing apparently to consider a larger peacekeeping force but only in the context so far of a cease-fire being agreed to and the parties actually supporting the UN's role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again the question remains, I guess, for the UN and for the international community: what if those conditions cannot be satisfied? What can anyone do? It is a matter, I think, of recognising that to the extent that agreement cannot be reached, there is no point in talking about a traditional peacekeeping operation because such operations are premised on a halt to the fighting and the consent of the parties involved to a UN presence, as we know all too well from equivalent operations in Cambodia and elsewhere.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be obvious difficulties in upping the ante and mounting some kind of peace enforcement operation under a chapter VII mandate. For such an intervention to be effective, a force would need to be deployed not only in the capital, Kigali, but across the country in very significant numbers. The force would have to be rather larger than that which has been contemplated so far for UNAMIR&mdash;maybe 30,000 or 40,000 troops. Such a force would need sufficient strength, certainly, to guarantee its own security, because some UNAMIR troops have already been killed with less significant resources. There is also all the evidence of the UNOSOM exercise in Somalia to remind us of the extreme risks of putting UN troops in situations where there is no effective government authority or local security protection, but where at the same time we are not dealing with a cross-frontier Gulf War kind of peace enforcement operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The further problem which confronts a UN operation relates to doubts about the capacity of the UN actually to mobilise such an operation, even if the decision were to be made to do so, in the absence so far of a major power UN member state showing itself to be willing and able to lead an enforcement operation under a UN Security Council mandate. As we have seen in Bosnia and Somalia, in the absence of a single major country being prepared to take on that role in a peace enforcement operation, some very real difficulties of command and control can arise.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mention these difficulties because all of us in the international community are wrestling with the kinds of options which might now be able to be mobilised. All I can say is it still seems to be some distance away before the UN Security Council is prepared to initiate a peace enforcement operation of the kind I have been outlining. Certainly, it would be premature for Australia to be stating a position on any such request to participate in that were it to be made. All I can say is we would consider any such request very sympathetically indeed because of the concern that we as a government feel and which I know is felt by the whole community. We have now made a humanitarian contribution of $1 1/2 million, but the immediate need obviously is to do something more than that to actually try to stop further killing.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have said in the white paper and in the accompanying documentation and statements is that we expect to be able to achieve, by the year 2001, 1 1/2 million jobs more than are presently in existence, with an unemployment rate of five per cent within our grasp. Whether we will precisely get to five per cent at that particular moment or whether it will be a little further delayed, it is impossible at this stage to predict. Of course, it is the case that getting that order of magnitude of job growth will depend on a high order of magnitude of GDP growth. It will depend on high GDP growth well into the four to five per cent range.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, Senator Harradine, jobs are jobs and they are all making a contribution. The participation rate is infinitely higher than it used to be when these sorts of jobs statistics were thrown around as casually as they are now being by those opposite about those percentages. Many more people want access to the work force, but many more people want access to the work force on a part-time or casual basis. It is not the case that everyone seeking a job is seeking a full-time job. They are real jobs. Those casual and part-time jobs are just as real in a family context or in the context of the circumstances of particular individuals. One way or another we believe that it is perfectly realistic and reasonable to expect to achieve the kinds of targets that I have just referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. In that cornucopia of rhetoric that we have just heard I did not detect answers to either of my two key questions, so I shall repeat them. Will the minister confirm that the government requires at least 4 3/4per cent growth each year to the year 2000 to achieve its employment and funding objectives? That is the key question. Supplementary and additional to that is whether the government expects to achieve that growth rate for each of the next six years without exception.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The precise growth rate that one needs over a period of time to achieve a particular target rate of employment depends on a whole series of assumptions, not all of which can be pinned down obviously with absolute confidence this far in advance. That is just a truism; it is the state of play. Whether we will need 4 3/4 per cent, less than that or more than that will depend on assumptions and possible changing patterns and participation rates and other things over time. I do not intend to hang my hat on any particular arithmetical equation. All I am saying is that I fully accept that growth rates in the range of four per cent plus will be necessary to achieve the kind of employment out-turn targets that we have identified. But we are confident on all the evidence we have at the moment, and on present knowledge and understanding of the way these new policy initiatives will work, that we can meet that objective of 1 1/2 million more jobs and an unemployment rate of five per cent being within our grasp.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I refer to yesterday's white paper and yesterday's reported current account blow-out and ask the minister the following: do the piecemeal items such as the extensions of the R&amp;D tax concession, support for regional development organisations, and increased funding for CSIRO indicate that the government has finally recognised that it cannot sit back and rely on the economic recovery and must instead develop a strategic industry policy to deal with Australia's structural problems? But when will the government muster the courage and intellectual rigour to develop such an industry strategy and include the measures which should have been in the white paper. I refer to industry-specific strategic plans to boost exports and replace imports; abolition of payroll tax; substantial government investment in regional infrastructure; a venture capital development fund; a small business loan insurance corporation; small business access to export markets development grants; requiring superannuation funds to invest in R&amp;D and venture capital; and tax incentives for training? <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier&mdash;and it was emphasised amply by Senator Gareth Evans today&mdash;the Australian government is operating the recovery from a strong macro-economic platform. We have pitched our white paper at ensuring that that recovery is long, endured and sustainable&mdash;that is the key thrust of what we have engaged in here. We have approached it by removing impediments to individual firms to be more competitive, to back private initiative. The two themes that run through the industry section of the white paper are ensuring that we build competitiveness within our firms and operating within a competitive environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked why we did not include a list of things. Perhaps I should send him a copy of the white paper because if he had read it he would have found that it addresses many of the points that he raised. For example, he asked about substantial government investment in regional infrastructure. During question time today several ministers have spoken about infrastructure bonds. I commend those bonds to Senator Spindler as a way in which the private sector can invest in infrastructure development in Australia. In the white paper the government announced a pool for the development of further infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked about a venture capital development fund. What does he think a pool development fund is? I do not know why he thinks the change in tax rates from 25 per cent to 15 per cent for small to medium enterprises does not create a pool of funds for venture capital but, also importantly, development capital for small to medium companies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked about small business access to export market development grants. I do not know whether I am wrong but I thought earlier in question time Senator McMullan explained that the export market development grants had been made more accessible for small business; so what Senator Spindler asked about has been done.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked about a small business loan insurance corporation. We have not embraced that. But I commend to Senator Spindler what we have said about the Commonwealth Development Bank. I emphasise that that bank is a lender of second resort which operates farther out on the risk spectrum than the private banks. It had a tremendously good record through the 1980s when some of the banks lost the plot of always returning a positive balance sheet. It has done very well in the rural sector and it is doing increasingly well in urbanised Australia. The bank is a facility that small to medium business in this country appreciates. The bank will be promoted even more, so that business has even greater access to it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked about compulsion for superannuation funds. We have not compelled superannuation funds to direct their investment. We do not apologise for that. We have provided incentives for those funds to invest in strategic areas of the economy. We have enabled fund managers and the people in those funds to exercise their discretion about prudential investment to ensure that they judge the merit and value of investment but in a way in which they are attracted to the areas of strategic need.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler asked about the abolition of payroll tax. That is a state rather than a Commonwealth matter. We have covered most of the matters raised by Senator Spindler; therefore, I suggest that he read the white paper more fully. I will be delighted to talk to him about those measures expressly. While parties need to differentiate their products, it is wrong to do so by claiming the government has not done certain things when in fact it has done those things.</PARA>

The minister has confirmed that today in what he said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coming back to the actual point, it is a damning indictment of the charade of serious analysis that the minister claims has gone into this statement to now have moved away from the green paper figure for growth and, indeed, to have cast serious doubts on the job creation figure that he has quoted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that in the last decade of Labor administration a four per cent-plus growth rate has been achieved only three times. Indeed, if those opposite look at the last 20 or 30 years of government in this country, they will see that that growth rate has not often been achieved. For the government to suggest that, at a time when it is impeding micro-economic reform&mdash;the very micro-economic reform that is required to increase our growth rate&mdash;it is suddenly going to be able to run four, five, or six consecutive years at growth rates of that level puts its credibility beyond stretching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industrial relations legislation this government introduced last year has set back further the process of reform, of freeing up the labor market and producing the flexibility that is so essential to achieve the sorts of results being talked about. We saw yesterday with the balance of payments blow-out that we still have a very serious balance of payments problem in this country, and it is not getting any better.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So four per cent-plus growth is going to be very difficult, if not impossible, under the present regime. If by any fluke the government happened to achieve that in the first few years, it would very soon run into the balance of payments problem that has bedevilled the Australian economy for so many years, and this government stands absolutely indicted for having failed to do anything about it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question Senator Short asked today about how this government was going to achieve a growth rate by which it could reduce the unemployment rate to the targeted five per cent by the year 2000-2001 is a particularly important question, and I think it was absolutely disgraceful for this nation that it was deflected by Senator Gareth Evans in such a significant way. One of the most important aspects as far as my interests are concerned is the question of people of overseas origin. Many of the ethnic groups in Australia have been suffering from an unemployment rate in excess of 20 per cent for over six years. This government has failed consistently to do anything about reducing those very high levels of unemployment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the white paper the government talks about a target of five per cent by the year 2000. That is all very well. Where in the white paper are those of overseas origin mentioned? Where in the white paper does it mention ethnic communities and the target for their unemployment levels by the year 2000? Is it simply adequate to have them remain at over 20 per cent, sometimes as high as 27 per cent, and do nothing about them?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the white paper there is mention of maintaining the existing workplace English language and literacy program&mdash;the WELL program. That is all very well, one might say&mdash;pardon the pun&mdash;but that increase does not start in any significant fashion until 1995-96. One of the most significant problems for people of overseas origin, particularly those of non-English speaking backgrounds, is that they do not have the English and literacy skills to go out into the workplace and compete effectively for employment. What has this government done about it? Nothing. It has deferred the increases further down the track to 1995-96, 1996-97 and beyond. How can this government claim that, in a global sense, it is targeting the reduction of unemployment to five per cent by the year 2000?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the workplace English language and literacy program, the white paper yesterday said that WELL aims to improve the language and literacy skills of workers who `are most at risk of displacement from industries requiring more highly skilled and literate workers'. The paper says, `at risk of displacement'&mdash;but what about the risk of not getting a job in the first place? The paper also says that the funding shown will restore the program to previous levels of activity beyond 1994-95. When these communities are suffering such excessively high levels of unemployment, why was the level reduced in the first place? Why has this document not resolved those problems? Why have they simply been put into the back room, never to see the light of day?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very serious questions to be raised&mdash;and particularly serious answers should be given. This government continues to fail to look at ways in which it can better equip people, particularly of non-English speaking background, to gain employment. It is a `could not care less' attitude. The government has gone around for the last 11 years blatantly telling lies to the ethnic communities. They know they are getting a rough deal and that they are not getting the jobs. They can see by this white paper and previous budgets, when expenditure that would help them gain gainful employment has been cut, that this government is lying to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see anywhere in this white paper where the ethnic communities will benefit from some targeted five per cent level of unemployment by the year 2000.

I had lots of jobs until I went back to school. The young students sitting in the gallery today do not have the prospects I had as a young person. Why not? This government has run Australia into debt. It has put us through the worst recession we have had in 50 years. The job prospects for those young people are negligible and will remain that way&mdash;and the white paper has done nothing to change that. The white paper does not promise them real jobs. It promises them a subsidised job, a constant training wage, some part-time work or that they will be in and out of training. It is not promising them a future or a long term career. It promises them more public servants and looking down the barrel of further unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Gareth Evans said here today that there would still be five per cent unemployment in the year 2000&mdash;but the government was not sure of the exact year. I do not know what hope that gives to young people and the long-term unemployed or for those searching for work. This is not the answer. We have had the hype of One Nation and Investing in the Nation and, for a couple of days, we will have the hype of this white paper, whatever it is called. It was supposed to have a title of `full employment' but the government had to design a new name because it was not about full employment. It was called Working Nation. I do not know how these names are dreamt up but I think it will be an abomination for Australia, with high-flying programs that fall in a heap. We heard some interesting information on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Four Corners </EMPHASIS>program on Monday night.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not about real jobs. This is the disgusting thing about this paper. It is not about creating real jobs; about supporting small business; about giving encouragement to small business to create jobs&mdash;and that is where the lasting jobs come from that give people a sense of career and an opportunity to develop skills. That is what we need to be doing; not throwing $6.5 billion on programs that are not going to really create jobs for people. One of the saddest things is that, again, we will see the hype and all the information that is spread about. People will be given false hope that they will get jobs. They will be churning through programs and parked in programs. </PARA>

How in the heck it thinks it will do that with the sorts of imposts that are currently on business I will never know&mdash;and I do not think business knows either. The government should have turned around and looked at the issues that should have been addressed: to get impost off business, to get taxes off business, and to get off the back of businesses to allow them to employ young people and older long-term unemployed people and to give them real jobs and real opportunities, rather than these fake jobs and the fudging of the figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will see, of course, a nice fudging of the figures. People will be on programs. They will be off the unemployment benefits list. It will look as though the unemployment rate is going down; but people in the community will know that the rate is not going down. They will know the hurt of long-term unemployment. It will look as though the unemployment rate is going down. The unemployment figures will be down, the government will call an election and, wacky-do, the figures will go up straight afterwards. It is the most cynical thing that has ever happened to Australia. It is probably not the most cynical thing; it is as cynical as One Nation. It is just as cynical as the Investing in the Nation statement and the Working Nation statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will commence by saying that there are a number of fundamentals in this package that remain very much up in the air. Firstly, the government has not told us why, only a few months ago, it actually abolished the junior wage with the industrial relations so-called reform bill, yet here we are, only a few months later, reintroducing a form of traineeship wage. The traineeship wage scheme itself is not defined as it has yet to be defined. The government has met with a high level ACTU committee&mdash;which probably means that one or two of them sat in a room at Kirribilli or something&mdash;saying, `Look, I think we can get this through, past the ACTU council, if we are lucky. We will work on the numbers, and you give us a hand, Paul&mdash;or Simon.' This crucial element of this package has yet to be resolved. Indeed, if the negotiations amongst the trade unionists fall down, basically the whole fundamental tenor of the package falls to pieces.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is gross hypocrisy to have abolished junior wages under the reform bill last year and now to try to introduce a trainee wage, having attacked, as Senator Watson said, our trainee wage during the last election. Senator Gareth Evans spent minutes and minutes of question time saying how terrible $3 an hour was. I am reliably informed that the government proposal is actually $3.20. I am sure everyone will be really pleased about the 20c. When I was a kid I could buy a can of Coke for 20c; I would get about one gulp of Coca-Cola for 20c now. But I am sure all the young people without jobs&mdash;many of them have not had jobs for 12 months&mdash;will be really pleased to get $3.20 an hour from this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we need to be told by the government whether these trainee wages will be subject to industrial relations law. If they are going to be, will the government alter every single award and therefore introduce the trainee wages that way or, if they are not subject to the IR legislation, what is the situation? All these things are left up in the air. People need to know these things before the whole package falls to pieces. </PARA>

<PARA>The question to Senator McMullan related to trade, his battle with Senator Cook and the fact that Ausindustry is going to take over from Austrade within Australia. Senator McMullan said there is no argument. It is good to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) here because we now have Austrade basically working with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. It is working with industry. It is working with EFIC. It is working with all different areas, which is good. That is great. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind all of that, but if the minister looks at what is happening around the world he will find that Austrade is very fearful that it will be taken away from the Minister for Trade and put with the industry minister. At least, with the Minister for Trade, Austrade can understand what is happening. We always had a locking together of Austrade internally, with its shopfront offices which have just started. There is nothing wrong with those, but we are now having it run by a different minister. He was not a bad minister when he had responsibility for trade, but obviously he is a very ambitious one as the minister with responsibility for industry and he wants to have all these things under his control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is all about identifying winners. If a person working for Austrade overseas wants to know about the local industries, he will have to go through a different minister. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Austrade already has great difficulties. Certainly, there is confusion as to what programs are currently available. The new arrangements with the shopfront offices will simply serve to compound that confusion. I am really asking how this can be rationalised and how it can best serve the purpose of industry to get our trade going with the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the concept of the shopfront offices is sound. Existing shopfronts already have some internal hiccups&mdash;I refer to the National Industry Extension Service&mdash;which need to be sorted out.

<PARA>I wonder whether all of these people giving their different ideas will not confuse the whole focus of trade which is needed if Australia is going to get where we want it to go internationally. I believe it definitely shows that Senator Cook is trying to wrest control of Austrade. He has failed in that regard; he has now taken a piece of Austrade away from the Minister for Trade. I ask the ministers to define very clearly the lines of responsibility between them; otherwise the confusion which will come into play will not serve us well in the future. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this occasion the appropriations and staffing committee resolved that there would be an additional amount of $1,704,500 for the 1993-94 year. As I recall, this was a unanimous resolution of the committee based on the best judgment of the members of the committee as to the minimum funding required to provide the Senate with the capacity to function in a reasonable way. In the event that the Minister for Finance disagrees with the committee, there is a mechanism in place as to how that problem should be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, over a number of years&mdash;this year being no different from the past year, the past year being no different from the year before that, and that year being no different from the year before that&mdash;the government chose to ignore in spirit and letter the terms of the resolution of the Senate. That resolution was reinforced by a motion presented to the Senate by former Senator Richardson, the chairman of Estimates Committee A. It is a resolution by one of the government's own members, and it was carried unanimously by the Senate. But the government seems determined&mdash;for whatever reason&mdash;to arbitrarily seek to impose upon the Senate its judgment as to the necessary funding required by the Senate for its management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very mindful of a comment once made by a previous Minister for Finance, former Senator Peter Walsh, when the Senate was contemplating appointing an additional select committee to inquire into a matter which the Senate had judged at that time was of sufficient importance that it required further consideration. Former Senator Walsh said that he would put a stop to that by ensuring that the funding was not available; in other words, he was threatening to strangle the capacity of the Senate to fulfil its obligations unto itself and to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That exemplifies the reason why the Senate, by way of resolution, is determined to play a paramount part in the level of funding that it requires for its proper functioning. The government continues to ignore the proper and due process. In the past couple of years the government has come back to the committee at a very late stage in respect of the proposed Senate funding levels and has made it impossible for the committee to respond. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year, for instance, one of the items proposed was continued funding of $52,000 for an information and technology systems officer in the Table Office. For reasons which are not apparent to me&mdash;and presumably are not apparent to the majority of the committee&mdash;the Minister for Finance has indicated that that amount will be deleted. It seems that there is a sense of determination on the part of the government to insist that it is deciding the amount and that it will change whatever appropriations are determined by the committee. The former Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, was written to on a number of occasions in relation to this process. More recently, the new Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley, has also been the subject of correspondence and we have received his responses which, I might say, give very little more than a modest glimmer of hope that the proper processes will be put in place in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My personal view is that the Senate should have exclusive right to make a judgment about the level of funding that is necessary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an important report by the Auditor-General into the Australian Trade Commission. It is an efficiency audit into the export market development grants scheme and its efficiency and effectiveness. It relates to what is the lifeline of Australia, namely, our export industries; it is the lifeline on which our economic survival must depend. Therefore, it is important that any scheme that provides assistance and incentive to exporters should be examined and made to work as effectively and efficiently as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This scheme is the largest item in Austrade's budget. Over the past 17 years some $4.5 billion in current dollar terms has been spent on this scheme. Austrade provides export market development grants amounting to $150 million to $250 million a year, depending on the government's enthusiasm at the time, to actual and potential exporters in accordance with the Export Market Development Grants Act. The majority of claimants receive their grant in the year that the claim is submitted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General has made a whole series of recommendations which I am glad to see Austrade has decided to accept. I commend Austrade for that and also commend the Auditor-General for the recommendations themselves. This report reveals that although there appears to be widespread support for the scheme&mdash;naturally, I suppose, from the business community which receives the grants&mdash;the auditor notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the nature of the scheme has made direct measurement of effectiveness elusive. The lack of performance measures combined with Austrade's minimal annual reporting of its largest budget item leaves Parliament inadequately informed of the scheme's effectiveness given the high profile of the scheme and the frequency of legislative changes required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numerous strategic planning documents exist which theoretically guide the scheme. Some of these documents contain outdated material. Although a Major Priorities Document 1993-94 has been produced, no one document summarises the overall position and direction of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austrade's responsiveness to its clients (both private and public) is impeded by the structure and wording of the Act and regulations. Austrade has pursued, and is continuing to pursue, improvements to the Act and procedures to accommodate the changing needs of the business community and to better target EMDG resources at the points of highest risk of misuse and fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>I shall return to the subject of fraud in a moment. The auditor notes that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All claims are investigated in order to prevent overpayments, misuse and fraud as well as to assist claimants in maximising the grant received. As a result, many millions of dollars are deducted from claims and a large but lesser amount is added to claims each year leading to the conclusion that the quality of claims is generally below expectation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG Unit is upgrading the scheme's risk management and fraud control procedures. Improvements to the fraud control plan, initial risk assessment and quality controls are, however, recommended.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said earlier, Austrade has agreed to accept those recommendations. On the question of information&mdash;and this is important for the parliament&mdash;the auditor notes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the fact that Austrade acquires extension data (from the information on the claim forms and the regular use of surveys), and conducts analysis of the scheme on a day-to-day basis, Parliament is provided with only very basic statistics (numbers of claims lodged and processed and the total value of grants paid) through the Austrade Annual Reports and the Annual Budget Program Performance Statements.</PARA>
<PARA>We will be dealing with those matters in the estimates committees a little later this month. In the Auditor-General's view:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . these statistics provide Parliament with little information about the clients of the scheme (how the eligibility criteria are working), the use of the grant moneys (whether grants are addressing export barriers) and the overall effectiveness of the scheme (whether grants are increasing exports and an export culture developing). The question of effectiveness requires performance measures, the development of which so far has proved to be elusive. Austrade has the information, however, to provide more meaningful reports on the focus and use of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>I should let Austrade know that at the up-coming estimates hearings we in the opposition will certainly be requiring it to provide some of that information. Let us have some information that is more meaningful than has been provided in the past. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been reviews of the scheme and the Audit Office notes that it recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . more information on the focus, use and effectiveness of the scheme be reported to Parliament and, in this report, has provided guidance on how this could be achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>I understand that Austrade has accepted that view. The Auditor-General also makes a point that we should stress too:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the pursuit of performance measures is not a waste of resources as it is only through these efforts that the factors that have assisted successful exporters can be identified.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish now to deal briefly with the questions of the amounts paid under these arrangements and the capacity for fraud. Austrade itself considers that decisions made under the scheme attract a high rate of administrative appeal. This is not only costly but is partly a function of the perceived complexity, particularly in the wording of the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit office view is that Austrade is being impeded in its attempts to respond in a timely fashion to market demands, and has recommended that, before the current scheme is renewed, the opportunity be taken to review the structure and wording of the act, regulations and procedures. There have been many amendments to the act, particularly over the past 11 years of this government; but there is still, extraordinarily, this enormous need for correction to the whole thrust of the act. As I said, it has been going now for something like 17 years and it is unfortunate that it has taken until now for the need for these corrections to be so effectively recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The EMDG act has significant powers to deal with fraud and misuse of the scheme; but the Auditor-General says that the difficulty has always been in proving intent. As a result, there has been a lower number of referrals to the Australian Federal Police and an even lower number of actual fraud cases pursued. Given the experience of other government programs, Austrade believes that the level of misuse and fraud could be greater than the statistics indicate and, before grants are paid, it is pursuing strategies that would prevent misuse and fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A major strength in preventing false payments is the regular site visits to all claimants and the annual investigation of all claims. But in the majority of cases these investigations result simply in corrections either in reducing the amount claimed or in increasing the amount to be paid, which of course is only infrequently. The level of negative adjustments is very significant, indicating in addition to the possibility of fraud and misuse that the quality of claims is certainly inadequate. By the way, the Auditor-General says that the quality of claims does not appear to be improving, even with the claimants' increasing use of export consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cause of inaccurate claims lies with the structure and wording of the EMDG act, and recommendations to change the act and regulations have been made previously. The work of the EMDG unit and the way the claimants submit these forms obviously must be improved. One thing that should be examined is an audit office recommendation that penalties be imposed where claims are inaccurate, particularly in the sense of overclaiming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I stress that the audit office recommends that more information on the focus, use and effectiveness of the EMDG scheme should be reported to parliament on an annual basis in order to provide feedback on the relevance of eligibility criteria, the export barriers being overcome with the assistance of the grant moneys, and the impact on Australia's export earnings and export culture. I am glad the Auditor-General is, as usual, noting the significance of the parliament and the need to report to parliament on these matters. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian National Audit Office report on the efficiency audit of the Australian Trade Commission export market development grants scheme says that the export market development grants scheme was established in 1974 and is managed by Austrade to provide taxable cash grants to assist Australian exporters in developing export markets. Between 1974 and 1991 more than 69,000 grants were made, as Senator Baume said, with an adjusted value of nearly $4.5 billion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any terms this is a major government program, and I welcome the efficiency audit carried out by the Australian National Audit Office. The report that resulted from that audit is to be applauded. It points to a broader malaise that is of concern to the Greens. Two key issues stand out: the need for improved accountability to parliament; and the need for a greater measure of performance assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These issues are not unique to the EMDG scheme. There are many instances where substantial amounts of public money are spent with little accountability and performance assessment. This must change. Another example of this that I can think of is that, in removing tariffs from a number of industries, at a cost to Australian taxpayers, there have been no systematic audits and assessments of the impact on these industries, of the expected outcomes, and of whether removing tariffs to certain levels has achieved the expected outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will address the issue of accountability first. The audit report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While there appears to be widespread support for the scheme the nature of the scheme has made direct measurement of effectiveness elusive. The lack of performance measures combined with Austrade's minimal annual reporting of its largest budget item leaves Parliament inadequately informed of the scheme's effectiveness given the high profile of the scheme and the frequency of legislative changes required.</PARA>
<PARA>In recent times the Greens have regularly stated that this lack of accountability to parliament is of great concern. The government is not spending its own money. The very substantial funding for programs such as the EMDG scheme comes from public funds. Therefore, the parliament, which comprises the elected representatives of the people who pay the taxes and levies that comprise those public funds, has the right to scrutinise the expenditure of public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has too often ignored the need for proper scrutiny of industry and trade policy measures. The community, however, will not tolerate this arrogance much longer. It is demanding greater levels of accountability, and the government must act to implement administrative mechanisms to provide that scrutiny. The Australian National Audit Office report provides some excellent recommendations in that regard, and I trust that the government, in conjunction with Austrade, will work to implement those proposals as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that I wish to raise briefly today relates to performance assessment. I am becoming increasingly concerned that many government industry assistance programs are not assessed against predetermined performance criteria. The EMDG scheme is no exception, and this was highlighted in the audit office report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The lack of performance measures is considered to be a function of the initial establishment of the scheme. If the scheme had been devised in such a way that its rationale was clearly stated so that its impact could be measured, considerable savings would have resulted from the ease with which the focus and impact of the scheme could have been monitored and regulated.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, if we say what we are hoping to achieve from spending massive amounts of money, then our ability to assess whether that has achieved its outcomes will be made a great deal easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also worth stating that the performance criteria used by government in assessing its programs and investments need to be reassessed. I find it extraordinary that we have so much emphasis on assessment and accountability focused on the provision of government spending and community services and not on these industry assistance programs. In that light, I am extremely concerned at the current review of Commonwealth and state service provisions in areas such as education, health, community services, law and order, and public housing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review which is being jointly carried out by Commonwealth and state governments is dominated in the list of participants by economists and Treasury officials from each state. Presumably, the emphasis will be on economic efficiency, with little consideration given to how any of those performance criteria are reached. For example, in education is it cost per student; cost per educator; cost per school; or will such performance criteria include a review of what a good education system can achieve? And what are the most cost effective ways of achieving those outcomes? If that were the case, why would one have such a system to look at the accountability of social service provision when there is absolutely no provision in such a committee to call for public submissions or public consultation? Those people who are providing health and community services, those people who are using education, health and community services, are not being asked to define a good performance criteria for the spending of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, I am pleased to see the commencement of the auditing of such things in government policy. But I am outraged that social service performance criteria are not being looked at in terms of what we are hoping to achieve by the spending of public money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the EMDG scheme, I trust that the government will consider implementing the recommendations of the report with respect to performance assessment and, at the same time, review the nature of the criteria used in that assessment. There is a need for the inclusion, for example, of criteria relating to the environmental impact of both production and products used for assistance under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people might say that that is not the role of government in relation to private industry. However, if private industry is gaining great deals of money, public money, in order to achieve certain aims, it is not beyond the realms of possibility to work out whether that money is being used in a process which is ecologically sustainable or non-sustainable and whether the government is actually assisting to move away from the directions of our other goals in public policy. This would be consistent with the principles of ecologically sustainable development that this government has so often claimed it is committed to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I commend the report of the Australian National Audit Office on the EMDG scheme and look forward to the government's response to the recommendations outlined in the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on the state of the automotive industry 1993</EMPHASIS> presented by the Automotive Industry Authority is the report presented annually by this government instrumentality on the progress being achieved under the auspices of the government's automotive industry plan towards greater efficiency, productivity and competitiveness on the part of the Australian automotive industry. In the report this year it is pleasing to see that the Australian automotive industry is making further progress towards the goals which the government has set for it in its automotive industry plan&mdash;obviously goals which the opposition also would seek to have the industry achieve&mdash;but there are also shortcomings highlighted in the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I will briefly deal with some of the good things about the Australian automotive industry that are contained in this report. The first thing to note is that in 1993 there was a 17 per cent improvement in the industry's productivity overall. That means that over the past two years&mdash;1992 and 1993&mdash;the combined improvement in productivity has been of the order of 31 per cent. Productivity improvement was a desperate need in the Australian automotive industry if it was ever to become competitive on an international basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also indicates that employment levels stabilised during 1993. Another positive note is that the quality of Australian motor vehicles continues to improve. The report states that local models made further gains in quality during 1993. That improvement in quality was not only with regard to the passenger motor vehicle producers&mdash;the manufacturers&mdash;but also the manufacturers of components for those motor vehicles. The report highlights that both of those factors contributed equally to fault reductions which have been identified since 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps not quite so encouraging is the fact that the price of vehicles rose sharply in 1993, and that price rise outstripped both the increase in the consumer price index and the increase in average weekly earnings, with the consequence that car affordability declined. The result of that was that the purchase of vehicles by private buyers, as distinct from fleet buyers and government buyers, fell for the third consecutive year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is of concern because if the industry is to have a successful long-term future, then obviously private purchases must remain a significant segment of the market. It is important, therefore, that manufacturers make every effort to contain cost increases. The government has a role to play in that regard as well. Governments do play a significant part in the cost structure of the industry through taxes and charges and through the cost of services such as transport, electric power provided by government-owned enterprises. As the report itself highlights, it is important that efficiency gains are made in those sectors as well as in the automotive industry itself, if price rises are to be retained at the minimum level possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that the authority has now initiated a program to monitor progress in the area of government taxation and the costs imposed by services provided by government instrumentalities, and that it is going to report the results of that monitoring on a regular basis. So we will have highlighted in future reports the impact of government charges and the provision of services by government instrumentalities with regard to their effect on motor vehicle manufacturing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final issue I want to address is another negative and that is the concern which the authority raises about deteriorating industrial relations in the industry. The report indicates a significant increase in industrial disputation during 1993 compared with earlier years. This is certainly a matter for regret because, as the report indicates, if there is to be sustainable improvement in both productivity and quality in the industry it is important that a peaceful industrial environment prevails in the industry. The report indicates that for the first time since 1989 the number of working days lost per thousand employees exceeded that for total manufacturing. So that is an area that requires serious attention which this government completely ignores in its approach to industrial relations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I would like to comment briefly on Landcare Australia's latest annual report. Page 4 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A review of achievements against targets shows that the bulk of objectives set for the year were achieved and costs were contained . . . </PARA>
<PARA>However, looking at the objectives of Landcare Australia on the previous page, I beg to differ. The organisation's objectives are mainly to create public awareness and to stimulate all Australians to develop a landcare ethic, as well as stimulate public participation in landcare activities. I believe that Landcare Australia has shown that it has played a part in stimulating awareness and heightening a broad land ethic. However, I believe it has taken a shallow approach when it comes to meeting the most important objective, which is encouraging public participation in landcare work. This means transforming any awareness generated into feelings of ecological responsibility and, hence, landcare action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Landcare Australia's annual report is thick on public relations material, which may be an indication of its priorities. Figures on landcare groups are further into the document, and it is clear that some states, namely, South Australia, the Northern Territory and the ACT, need far more encouragement for public participation in landcare groups. Perhaps Landcare Australia could spend more energy on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that companies have some mechanism of channelling funds into landcare, and Landcare Australia proudly believes that because it has tax deductibility status this is of great benefit to landcare groups. What landcare groups tell me themselves is that it would be of greater benefit if they had tax deductibility status themselves. Then corporations could donate to them directly without having to go through an administrative structure that does not give them all the funds anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also noted from the report the number of new landcare project offices which are coordinating local landcare groups. This is another criticism the government receives when it does not devolve responsibility to the landcare groups themselves. Landcare groups feel that dispensers of funding, whether they be state or federal departments, eat up a lot of money for landcare through propping up their own organisations and employing a lot of people. My point is that when this occurs far less money gets to the people on the ground doing the landcare work. A recent review of how much more money reaches the on-ground landcare project shows that this figure is less than 10 per cent of the money originally allocated. We need to address this problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another issue that we need to address with respect to landcare moneys. The Landcare Australia annual report talks about expending much effort into raising the awareness of city people and city landcare. Yet inherent in the way the government doles out money for landcare is a rural bias. Even the city landcare program itself has a rural bias. Although we may need to spend most of our resources in agricultural areas, there also needs to be provision for real city landcare. However, the guidelines impose the condition that to get any city funding one has to show a link with a rural project. This would be very difficult for many city projects who are finding it almost impossible to get funding out of the program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only do we need to redefine the conditions attached to funding but we need to look at when we fund these projects. Most money is delivered in the summer season, which is not useful to groups when most planting is done in winter. There also needs to be more emphasis on funding for follow-up landcare and maintenance because too much money is spent on demonstration projects. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The report shows improvements in performance in a number of key indicators, but it is also a damning indictment of the failure of all governments to fulfil recommendations pertaining to reducing levels of custody. The report indicates that the number of deaths in all forms of custody in 1992 was the lowest since 1984, and that is an achievement which should not go unnoticed. It is, after all, the very aim and purpose of the recommendations that people who, for whatever reason, are in custody should not be at risk of their lives, either by their own hand or through other means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also shows that in 1992 no Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people died in police lockups. I think this should be commended, and I also think the work of the Aboriginal visitors scheme should be noted in regard to this. I believe that both the police in their attempts to improve on their record and the Aboriginal people themselves in the way they have cooperated deserve recognition for that work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our observations, particularly in Western Australia, indicate that the greatest achievements in the reform process started by the royal commission have been in the police lockups. Indeed, in Western Australia no Aboriginal or islander person has died in a police lockup for over 3 1/2 years. It would be unnecessary to say that no person should ever die in a police lockup but, considering the history of particularly Aboriginal deaths in custody in WA, that figure of 3 1/2 years indicates major improvements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people dying in all forms of custody is still out of proportion to their place in the overall population of this country. While making up only 1.1 per cent of the adult population, they were still eight per cent of the 1992 custodial deaths. Likewise, the report shows that, while the imprisonment rate of the general population stood at 99 per 100,000 in 1992, the figure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people was 1,481 per 100,000. This is the figure which, above all else, needs to be reduced if we are to make significant and permanent progress on the rate of deaths in custody of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This level of overrepresentation is not uniform across the states. Sadly, my own state of Western Australia has the highest level of overrepresentation, at 22.7 times that of non-Aboriginal people. The report shows some good news on the rate at which people are being taken into police custody. The rate has fallen from 183 per 100,000 in 1988 to 152 per 100,000 in 1992. Again, the fall is not consistent across the states, but the rate for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, while it fell, did so from 3,539 per 100,000 in 1988 to 2,801 per 100,000 in 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, this drop of 21 per cent, while it is impressive, was accompanied by a rise in the proportion of Aboriginal people as against non-Aboriginal people being taken into police custody, particularly in New South Wales, WA and the Northern Territory. The message here is that policy changes seem to be resulting in fewer people being taken into custody but that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are not benefiting as much from the policy changes as are others. The overrepresentation of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people being taken into custody stood at 26.2 times, but for my own state of WA it was an alarming 51.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, as I said earlier, indicates some progress, and if the 1992 results for deaths in custody are repeated and the improvement maintained then we will be on the right track. However, we are still seeing the enormous disparity between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal people and their contact with the criminal justice system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The royal commission made it perfectly plain that reducing imprisonment rates is a fundamental requirement. It sounds so obvious as to not be worth repeating, but it seems that progress is slow in this area, particularly in WA. I can only call on all governments to move towards a full implementation of the royal commission recommendations&mdash;not next year, not the years after, but now. It is a matter of life and death. </PARA>

I ask that those logos be noted, not necessarily to congratulate Landcare Australia on its work towards getting sponsorship, but rather to look at and think carefully about the appropriateness of this approach. The approach is written about on page 7 in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the company's obligation to obtain corporate sector support as a primary means of funding awareness raising programs and assisting `on the ground' landcare group activity, the campaign for sponsorship has been maintained, with sponsorships approximately 21% higher than in 1991/92.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value of sponsorships received and/or committed during 1992/93 was approximately $3.56 million.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These kits have been generously supplied by Monsanto Australia Limited, the makers of Roundup herbicide, as part of their support for Greening Australia and landcare groups. Each kit contains:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.one litre of Roundup herbicide by Monsanto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.one litre of Goal CT residual herbicide by Monsanto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.200 Sure Gro tree guards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Technical information on tree establishment and protection.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to quote from a letter by the Launceston Environment Centre Inc. to the author of that letter from Greening Australia. In part, that letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Re: Use of Roundup and Goal CT Herbicides.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been brought to the attention of the Launceston Environment Centre that a circular sent to Landcare groups in Tasmania by Greening Australia. It came as a shock to discover that Greening Australia is both pushing and promoting the use of certain herbicides onto the Tasmanian community, whose involvement and commitment to the elimination of land degradation and the improvement of water quality is expressed through Landcare. It is precisely for the rectification and improvement of our abused environment that people work for and with Landcare.</PARA>
<PARA>Further in that letter there was an explanation of the problem with the use of these herbicides. I quote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. The use of chemicals may threaten the fragile ecosystems:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Widespread use in catchment areas may contaminate water (the recent atrazine problem is one example) leading to an undue level of risk for the total environment (both human and natural).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* Such practices may not be consistent with the Precautionary Principle (ESD).</PARA>
<PARA>Another problem associated with that was as stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reduced impetus for innovation:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">* While chemicals are being used the `pressure' is off both Greening Australia and Monsanto to trial non chemical methods of weed control.</PARA>
<PARA>That includes anything, including the wonderfully appropriate use of superheated water, which is effective as a herbicide. It is used successfully in New Zealand and is being trialled in several places in Australia. In taking note of this document we should carefully mark the trend of the landcare program to generate income from sponsorships. We should be very careful about that. </PARA>

<PARA>I welcome this opportunity to speak to the motion of which I gave notice earlier this week. It concerns the actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during his recent visit to Vietnam. I want first to deal with his refusal&mdash;until he was shamed into it&mdash;to so much as acknowledge, whilst he was in Vietnam, the contribution made by the 50,000 service men and women who served in the Vietnam war, thousands of whom were wounded and more than 500 of whom made the supreme sacrifice and died in that war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to deal with the Prime Minister's invitation to the Vietnamese Communist Party chief, Mr Do Muoi, to visit Australia. Thirdly, I want to raise the matter of the proposed visit to Vietnam of a human rights delegation from Australia, which appears to have been the subject of further discussion or negotiation between Mr Keating and the Vietnamese government during his recent visit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not raise these matters to reopen debate on Australia's participation in the Vietnam war. That participation initially received overwhelming support by the Australian people, as witnessed by the record majority won by the coalition government in the 1966 election where, virtually, the only electoral issue involved was Australia's role in the war. Subsequently, that overwhelming public support did erode and our involvement became a divisive issue. I will not reopen that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one indisputable fact is that 50,000 Australian service men and women participated honourably and gallantly in that war. They won more than 1,000 awards for gallantry, including four Victoria Crosses. More than 2,000 were wounded in action and more than 500, as I said, paid the supreme sacrifice. It is incomprehensible to me and to millions of Australians that the Prime Minister should deliberately choose, while he was in Vietnam, to refuse even to acknowledge the participation of gallant Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only incomprehensible; it is deeply offensive, hurtful and weak, and it is cringe mentality at its most pitiful. Long after all else about Mr Keating's Vietnam visit is forgotten, the one thing that will be remembered is his cold, arrogant answer when asked early on whether Vietnam veterans could expect some act of recognition while he was in Vietnam. His response was, `I don't think they are expecting something and, frankly, why should they?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only the 50,000 Australian Defence Force personnel and their families, relatives, friends and all fair-minded non-Vietnamese Australians who found the Prime Minister's attitude and actions offensive. So, too, did the 150,000 Australians of Vietnamese origin. These people, many of whom also fought in the war, fled to Australia because, despite their best efforts and those of their allies, the communist forces eventually won the war. So what was a harsh and repressive communist regime was installed in Vietnam, a regime which over its first 10 to 15 years in power&mdash;through to the late 1980s&mdash;devastated Vietnam's economy, produced abject poverty amongst its people and made Vietnam one of the five poorest nations on earth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that in more recent years, under the economic reforms known as Do Muoi, economic growth is taking place, but there is a long way to go with annual per capita incomes still around only $200. These people who have made such a significant contribution to Australia since their arrival and who have demonstrated, and continue to demonstrate, a fierce loyalty to Australia deserve very much better from Australia's Prime Minister. There can be no valid excuse for the Prime Minister's deliberately calculated offensive action. The reasons he advanced, until shamed into changing direction, did not stand up to serious examination. His excuse that there was no place in the whole of Vietnam where he could make an act of recognition was pitiful. There were scores of appropriate sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His argument that recognition would have detracted from his main aim&mdash;which, he said, was to look forward rather than to dwell on the past&mdash;was, quite frankly, puerile. We cannot build for the future by ignoring the past. Mr Keating knows that full well&mdash;and so, I am certain, would his Vietnamese hosts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's invitation to the head of the Vietnamese Communist Party, Mr Do Muoi, also shows an extraordinary insensitivity to those Australians of Vietnamese origin. Mr Do Muoi is not a head of state; he is not a member of the Vietnamese government; he is not an official representative of his nation. Instead, he heads a political party whose actions have caused great hardship, great poverty, great repression, and gross violation of human rights to the people of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although Mr Do Muoi is said to be the most powerful figure in Vietnam, that in itself is no reason to extend to him an official invitation to visit Australia, presumably at taxpayers' expense. A leading member of the Vietnamese Australian community, in a letter to me at the conclusion of Mr Keating's visit to Vietnam, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Keating's trip and his statement about Australian involvement in the Vietnam War and Australian responsibility to the poverty of Communist Vietnam as well as Mr Keating's invitation to Mr Do Muoi has deeply insulted the honour and dignity of free Australian Vietnamese people.</PARA>
<PARA>I know there are millions of Australians, not just those of Vietnamese origin, who agree fully with that statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The coalition parties in the Senate are pleased to have the opportunity to engage the government in debate on the major social issue facing the Australian community: mass unemployment&mdash;an unemployment rate which, as Ted Evans, Secretary to the Treasury, recognised, was a matter of government choice. Mr Keating, through policy choice, drove this economy into recession in the late 1980s and early 1990s. As he put it&mdash;and I remind the Senate&mdash;`it was the recession we had to have.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In clinical terms, it was the recession which cost Australia half a million jobs. It was his choice of response to the overheated economy which preceded it. There were alternative responses: to cut expenditure, accelerate micro-economic reform, reform the labour market, and others. But he chose rather to force up interest rates until they crushed employers. Record bankruptcies resulting from failed businesses and record insolvencies all followed. This was his choice, as he put it, `to dampen demand'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, make no mistake about it: record long-term employment, mass unemployment, and underemployment as we have it today in Australia are a result of government policy choice; and it did not have to be. It did not have to be a situation where unemployment in Australia is a third higher than the OECD average. It is the new definition of Labor's social justice. It would cause Chifley to turn in his grave. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, almost as an afterthought, we have Mr Keating's response to this human tragedy&mdash;a tragedy for which he, more than any one individual, is responsible. It is Mr Keating who constantly and recklessly builds unreal expectations, and then causes crushed hopes with yet further exaggerated statements such as that we are debating today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating cannot seem to help himself. His enormous ego always gets in the way of good policy. Again he had to dress this statement up as reminiscent of Chifley's famous full employment paper&mdash;I remind the Senate that that was a full employment paper, as opposed to this paper&mdash;of the 1940s. Of course, Mr Keating's statement was bigger, better and more important. This is the same Mr Keating who promised a $130 billion avalanche of investment after the election&mdash;when, in fact, business investment is now at a 40-year low&mdash;and who brought down the One Nation statement, which he said would create 800,000 jobs and bring unemployment down three percentage points. Remember that, under Mr Keating, exports are going `gang busters'. Yet in yesterday's merchandise trade figures, helpfully coming down on the same day as this white paper, we saw exports of merchandise trade rising five per cent while imports rose 13 per cent. That is exports going `gang busters'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is, on my calculation, the 25th of these so-called significant economic statements we have had from this government in the last 11 years. Always the next one beats the last one: so much of it repetitious; so much building false expectations; so many disappointments following, only in turn to be followed by yet another statement. What is the bottom line of this continual statement approach: 906,000 Australians unemployed as of March 1994.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the statistical figure. That is without adding the underemployed and those who have given up: 906,000 people unemployed&mdash;in the recovery. We are in the recovery; we are feeling better. Yet a fraction under a million Australians are still unemployed, and 370,000 of those are long-term unemployed&mdash;that is, they have been unemployed for 12 months or over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, you might have seen yesterday how in the white paper long-term unemployment now seems to be conveniently defined as 18-months unemployment rather than 12-months unemployment. Redefine it as the government will, there are still just under 400,000 Australians who have been out of work for over a year&mdash;and that is an absolute national disgrace. Mr Deputy President, I remind you, as the Bureau of Statistics reminded us only a few weeks ago, that that long-term unemployment figure has trebled in the last four years. No other Australian government in our history can boast such an achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, remember also that it is not just young people who are suffering, although yesterday's emphasis in the white paper was on young Australians. I remind the Senate that, of unemployed males over 45 years of age, almost 60 per cent are long-term unemployed. They, in turn, have nearly a quarter of a million children. So we find older members of the community well under the retiring age, who never anticipated that they would be unemployed, not only losing their jobs but finding 12 months later that they are still not able to regain employment. These are qualified and trained people. Of course, they cannot regain employment, not because of a lack of training but because there are no jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a human tragedy clinically skimmed over in yesterday's statement. It is true that there are severe economic consequences that flow from mass unemployment, but the social consequences are even greater. As the Brotherhood of St Laurence reminds us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . at a personal and individual level, the impact of unemployment&mdash;by whatever measure one chooses&mdash;is nothing short of devastating . . . unemployment means a real and hurtful contraction of personal networks and social life. People have no choice but to withdraw from mainstream activity.</PARA>
<PARA>The Brotherhood went on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ironically, one of the few constant links to other people is through what is understandably perceived to be a demeaning, ritualistic visit to the CES or DSS offices.</PARA>
<PARA>As John Hewson said in the other place a moment or two ago, with the background of the green paper that was put out on unemployment at the end of last year, it is astonishing that in that document of more than 240 pages, there is only one paragraph which deals with the social cost of unemployment. Yesterday's statement had little more. It is astonishing, but convenient to this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating led a less imperial lifestyle, perhaps he would appreciate the consequences of his policy choices, such consequences as increased crime, family breakdown, homelessness, health problems, drug and alcohol abuse and the creation of a permanent underclass of Australians deprived of opportunities available to others. But there was ample evidence to tell him that such was the case. Last year his own Economic Planning Advisory Council found that reducing unemployment to 6.5 per cent, even though a high figure&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . would reduce the divorce level by just over 800 annually, increase marriages by 4400, and lead to around 20 fewer annual homicides.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Brendan Nelson, federal president of the AMA, found that rates of death and illness for unemployed Australians is significantly higher than for the employed. He said that the death rate for unemployed men is 17 per cent higher. Unemployed men have 42 per cent more serious illness; 35 per cent more hospital admissions; 267 per cent more mental disorders and visit the doctor 50 per cent more often. Professor Riaz Hassan of Flinders University has noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The period of increasing youth suicide strongly correlates with a high youth unemployment rate.</PARA>
<PARA>I read recently that Australia now has the highest level of youth suicide in certain age groups in the world. What a shocking indictment and what a shameful embarrassment to all policy makers! Graham Burrows, professor of psychiatry at Melbourne University, told a Senate committee on youth unemployment recently of a study that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . showed a significant rise in amphetamine use with unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA>And there is homelessness. Need I remind honourable senators again of the 1989 Burdekin report which estimated that between 50,000 and 70,000 young people were either homeless or at serious risk, and that the stresses of youth unemployment were listed amongst the causes of such youth homelessness. Labor's decade of unemployment has also coincided with a doubling of the proportion of the population who were victims of robbery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Keating and the Labor government chose the recession path, did they take these social consequences into account or were they blissfully ignorant? On either account they fail the test. However, whilst prevention is always better than cure, the government nevertheless set the wrong policy framework and we as a nation are now faced with the question of how to address this tragedy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper has become the government's policy prescription to correct its errors. The question, of course, is this: has it finally got it right? The clear choice of this government that comes through this document is that it remains that the training option, with some subsidies for at least temporary jobs, remains its preferred choice. It has been the government's approach for some time. I remind honourable senators that currently over 150,000 people are on jobstart; nearly 70,000 are on jobtrain; nearly 40,000 are on special intervention programs; 11,000 are on the accredited training for youth program; 10,000 are on the landcare and environment action program; 10,000 are on jobskills; 5,000 are on the new enterprise incentive scheme; 7,000 are on the community activity program, and about 25,000 are on the community development employment program. With this program it adds a new subsidy and short-term jobs for long-term unemployed&mdash;that is, those now unemployed for over 18 months&mdash;which it dresses up under the title of a jobs compact. Therefore, it is basically a more of the same approach. It has not varied its answer despite the experiences that it has seen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there is political advantage in it for Mr Keating. It again artificially reduces the number of jobless, as does the mature age allowance and as will the parenting allowance, although there are some positives in that initiative. The fact that most of the government's new scheme will be at its maximum effect about the time of the next election could be just coincidence but for the fact that we have seen it so often before. The jobless are conveniently parked outside the official figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, leaving aside justifiable cynicism, will this policy prescription lead to a significant reduction in the jobless in real terms? That has to be the test. Will it lead to a significant reduction in the jobless in real terms&mdash;that is, after taking into account those who are parked in training schemes or make-work schemes, those who have given up and those who are significantly underemployed? Regrettably, the answer must be no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Adequate education and training is important, and work experience is important in the competition between individuals for employment opportunities, but the only way to significantly reduce Australia's mass unemployment is to create a large number of new jobs&mdash;real and sustainable jobs. That will not be achieved by the policy prescription contained in this white paper. Only a small fraction of the $6.5 billion of extra money which must be found by government through increased tax and borrowings is targeted to the creation of new jobs. Sadly, it could even be counterproductive because it contributes to further cost pressures on business, increased interest rates and increased inflation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, we would not want to be misinterpreted. We accept that there will be a need for public money for training in some instances, for counselling in some instances and, in other ways, to put the long-term unemployed in the best position to take employment opportunities. But if they are to be further trained, albeit in conjunction with short-term placements&mdash;if real, sustainable and satisfying jobs are not available&mdash;then it becomes yet another cruel hoax. Even if it means simply a churning of the unemployed with the short-term&mdash;up to 18 months&mdash;missing out at the expense of those unemployed for over 18 months so that the short-term unemployed have to become long-term unemployed to get the same opportunities presented to them by this government, then that amounts to an equal disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the government in its document talks about a redistribution of jobs. What an indictment in its own terms! The government has allowed itself a long time to think about its solution, but there is little in this document to build public confidence. The administering department, DEET, is in an awful state, as is now publicly known. Astonishingly, the government still has to negotiate its training wage with the ACTU. It is very convenient for it not to have to give details in this paper one might think, but, fancy, this is one of the two principal pillars of this statement yet it has the nerve to tell the Australian people that it is not yet negotiated, that it has not received the imprimatur from the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the terms of the job compacts are unknown. What is to be the obligation of the employer under the job compact? What is the obligation of the employer after the term of the compact is complete? In particular, is the employer bound by the provisions of the so-called Industrial Relations Reform Act that was passed last year that makes employment even more rigid and that will be a disincentive to employers taking unemployed people on under these job compacts? Today Senator Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, did not know. He turned to Senator Schacht, who nodded his head and thought it was the case. This government has not even worked out the detail of the two principal pillars of the document that it brings to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was vitally important for the government to this time get it right because, if we go into the next cyclical downturn without having slashed unemployment before then, the position will be even worse. In fact, respected labour economist Professor Judith Sloane warns that the next downturn could see unemployment rates of over 14 per cent. Labor does not seem to recognise that the number of full-time jobs lost by teenagers has doubled each recession. That demonstrates how critical it is this time to get it right and why we are justified in being so disappointed in the response that this government has brought down after such a long period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if Labor astonishingly achieves its objective&mdash;and Senator Short indicated today that it is premised on 4.75 per cent growth until the end of the century, which is highly unlikely to be achieved&mdash;what is its bottom line? What does it regard as satisfactory? The answer is 5 per cent unemployment&mdash;half a million Australians destined to the unemployment scrap heap forever. Is that a strategy to generate jobs? It is again an appalling abdication of responsibility of government. This is not Chifley's Labor Party. This is not Chifley's full employment statement. This is a partial employment statement to create make-work jobs on a short-term basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would have positively responded to an objective analysis of the disincentives to employment by small business, in particular the overregulation which was touched on by the government but not seriously. It even had the gall to claim deregulation by temporarily suspending the training guarantee levy, which it itself imposed a few years ago. The government says that it is now going to have a program of review. This is something really to grab hold of as a real achievement! In fact, the cost to business of compliance with regulation in this country is estimated at over $20 billion a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had really tackled overregulation, which every small business person will tell us is a disincentive, we would have been more impressed. If it had tackled high taxation, particularly taxes that add to the costs of business&mdash;such as the increase in fuel taxes we had last year; the capital gains tax and the fringe benefits tax, which in their current form are disincentives to employment; and payroll taxes, which are state taxes but the removal or reduction of which the Commonwealth could help fund&mdash;we would have been more impressed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government had tackled high interest rates&mdash;and I remind honourable senators that real interest rates in this country are still among the highest levels of all Western developed countries&mdash;we would have been more impressed. If those opposite had tackled the real rigidities in the labour market&mdash;and they were reminded the other day of them by the OECD and IMF&mdash;they would have got a positive response from us. If they had tackled such disincentives with real programs to reduce them, we would have applauded such a move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we wanted to see in this white paper was a policy program that would encourage business to invest, to take risks, to grow and to employ&mdash;that is, a strategy to generate jobs. But it was not there. What we wanted to see was a new commitment to micro-economic reform, recognising that our exports to Asia are growing&mdash;but only because Asia is growing, not because we are more competitive than others. In fact, Mr Acting Deputy President, as you would know, if we look at our market share in the region, we see that our competitors are improving their position more rapidly than we are because we are less competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is not a static game. We cannot afford to stop. We cannot afford to slap ourselves on the back, as Mr Keating did a while ago when he said that micro-economic reform had basically achieved its goal. We want to see a government seriously tackling the issue of low business investment, the related issue of the deficit and, in particular, the need to build domestic savings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sufficient jobs will not be created without a huge lift in business investment, and that will not occur without business confidence in government. The problem is that business cannot have confidence in a government which promises to reduce taxes and then reneges on that promise&mdash;the great election lie; a government which is so blind as to the cost burdens of business that it puts up fuel taxes as business is struggling to come out of the recession; and a government which rams through even more restrictive industrial relations policies, as it did last year, when everyone knows that a more flexible labour market is so badly needed by business in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In each of the Labor Party's anti-business stances and therefore anti-employment stances, it has moved hand in hand with the minority parties&mdash;the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA)&mdash;who must accept their share of the blame. No doubt we will hear from Senator Kernot in a minute that the answer to Australia's unemployment is to increases taxes even further and put more pressure on business and on its potential to profit and employ. With over 300,000 long-term unemployed and a million unemployed overall, and Chifley's call abandoned, how can a government which lied its way back into office come to the parliament with, in effect, policies that offer more of the same?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We say proudly that we on this side of the chamber, the Liberal and National parties, have led the policy debate in so many areas that could have offered constructive change&mdash;in enterprise bargaining, in privatisation and corporatisation, in tax reforms, and in incentives for saving. We led the debate on trainee wages, which has now been taken up by the government. We urged the introduction of private sector efficiencies into the CES and private sector opportunities, and were condemned for doing so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will continue to lead. Labor has failed and offers only more of the same, as evidenced by this disappointing white paper. It is time for a new direction, and it is only the coalition parties which offer to the Australian people that alternative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Excuse me, I want to start by referring to John Curtin. If opposition senators will just listen, they will get the context. In 1944 John Curtin asked his minister for post-war reconstruction to prepare a white paper on unemployment. Ten months and seven drafts later, Ben Chifley tabled the paper Full Employment in Australia. At its heart was Chifley's determination to establish full employment as the fundamental aim of active government policy. That determination was driven by his experience during the Depression. `I am not one of those who suffered want in those years,' he said, `but it left a bitterness in my heart that time cannot eradicate.' Not suffering want applies to a lot of us in here. I say to Senator Ian Macdonald, before he laughs again, that I wonder whether we share the same bitterness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many years later, Chifley's biographer, L.F. Crisp, wrote that `the key to Chifley's life work, the mainspring of his political struggle' was his `compassion for fellow Australians in agony of mind and spirit caused by economic forces outside their individual&mdash;but within their collective&mdash;powers to control.'<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) summoned up the spirit of Ben Chifley to help him in the run-up to his own white paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President, there are some things that we cannot expect in terms of courtesy sometimes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summoning up the spirit of Ben Chifley, we find that it has not turned out to be a friendly ghost for the Prime Minister. I note that today the Prime Minister, during his speech to the National Press Club, back-pedalled at a rate of knots from his `Labor to the bootstraps' claim of earlier in the week.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is just as well because the Prime Minister knows that the ideas, the concepts and the themes which underpinned Ben Chifley's white paper are absent from his. Where is the recognition that those Australians who bore the brunt of the recession are entitled to a fair share of the recovery&mdash;not just any little share but a fair share of the recovery? Where is the commitment to public capital expenditure? Where is the acknowledgment of the need to reform Australia's biased, unfair and outdated taxation system? Where is the recognition of small business as a primary generator of jobs? Where is the basic acceptance of the obligation owed by the government to unemployed Australians to create and maintain the conditions which will encourage employment growth? These things are absent from the Keating white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad fact is that Ben Chifley would be ashamed to put his name to this document, and Paul Keating knows it. The sad fact is that Paul Keating's white paper is, to steal a line from another leader haunted by a ghost, a thing `full of sound and fury, signifying nothing'. It is a pretty enough package. It contains some useful measures and it provides at last some opportunities for unemployed people to gain some additional training and work experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It contains some important changes to the social security system which will go some way towards reducing discrimination against part-time and casual workers and which will hopefully take us a bit further down the track towards achieving a sensible balance between paid work, unpaid work and family responsibilities. It contains a small regional environment employment program&mdash;a welcome, if belated, initiative. The acknowledgment, although slight, of the potential of green jobs is also welcome. It will, I think, bring some relief to those Australians who paid for the recession and who are paying for the recovery with the loss of their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Welcome though all of this is, it really does not do much more than that. It really cannot be seen as much more than, as Julian Disney described it in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, `a down payment on what is necessary to restore hope, dignity and security for unemployed people.' But I do not think a down payment is good enough. I think unemployed Australians deserve more than that. I think they deserve more than a smattering of training and work experience schemes and some tinkering around the edges of social security programs. I think they deserve some leadership and vision from the government and the Prime Minister.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought it was very ironic today that so many newspaper banners had `Keating's vision' written across the top when actually the two things that are conspicuously absent from this document are leadership and vision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are four key areas which the government has failed to come to grips with in this white paper. We believe that until and unless they are addressed, the government's response to unemployment will continue to be symbolic rather than substantial. The first key area is: moves towards removing tax disincentives to employing new workers. Senator Hill has touched on that point. The Democrats believe that investment by businesses in human capital, in workers, should be treated in a similar way to investment in physical capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have at the moment is a taxation system which is biased against investment in employment and which actually penalises labour intensive businesses while encouraging and subsidising capital intensive businesses. This is a situation which makes no sense at all. The white paper does virtually nothing about it. Yes, there is the abolition of the training guarantee levy. We have listened to what business has had to say about how that has outlived its usefulness. We called for the suspension of that levy in our budget submission to the government. But we wanted to replace it with tax incentives for training. The government has partly responded with increased subsidies for traineeships, but it continues to miss the fundamental point of the different tax treatment of capital and labour inputs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another disappointment is the continuing failure of the government to tackle the vexed question of payroll tax&mdash;a tax on employment. The Democrats put up a proposal in our budget submission to the government to phase out payroll tax. But the government just keeps putting this in the too-hard basket. Unlike the Liberals, who are absolutely incapable of saying anything civil about the Democrats, I am quite capable of acknowledging the work of the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, in securing the cooperation of many state premiers in their quest to work towards the phasing-out of payroll tax if the coalition had won the previous federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I happen to think that if the Democrats, with their scarce resources, can talk to industry and small business and develop a proposal to get rid of payroll tax, and get it independently costed, surely the government can come up with one or two ideas of its own. For a start, it could look at the creative ideas on abolishing payroll tax which are contained in the much more imaginative recent European Community unemployment white paper. At the very least, the government should consider holding a payroll tax summit. It should get on the table some concrete ideas about taking action to do that. It is so frustrating that year after year, when we know what a disincentive this is, we do nothing about it. If the government will not do it, then I will. Constantly running into a brick wall of government indifference on this is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second key area that I think the government should have taken action on is that of increasing the capacity of small business to grow and create new jobs. Despite Senator Cook's claims during question time, the white paper's response to this issue is inadequate. On small business, the government's score is one out of three. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is fair. The government gets a tick for information sharing, networking and management training. But on the critical issues of access to finance and taxation reform, it just has not gone far enough. Apparently, we are going to train bank managers to be nice to small business. But, for example, there is no plan to reduce interest rate spreads, which are currently twice the OECD average. There are some good initiatives for small business in the white paper, and I have acknowledged that. But the big issues of access to finance and taxation reform are not tackled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third key area I want to touch on is increasing expenditure on infrastructure. This is a really disappointing failure. It is a failure to signal a reversal in a 40-year decline in public investment in infrastructure. It is a failure which is nothing short of a disgrace. I can only hope&mdash;and I hope it is not in vain&mdash;that there is something in next Tuesday's budget to address the critical areas of public transport, water, health and education infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth key area I want to touch on is that of a strategic and comprehensive industry policy. My colleague Senator Spindler will be dealing with this in detail. All I need to say is that I believe the paper signifies the government's continuing incapacity to learn from the experience of other countries and its total lack of ideas on industry policy. Its inability to come to grips with these issues is a symbol of its failure to recognise that old structures and old systems are changing and it is time for a fresh approach to employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the white paper has failed to deliver in this area primarily because those who drafted it do not seem to have got out and talked enough to those who are affected by it. I think the Prime Minister should be out there talking more about green jobs and the enormous potential to generate employment in the environment industries. He needs to understand that it is not just a matter of dreaming up new schemes. We know where the work needs to be done. We know how we have ruined, polluted and destroyed so much of this country. We know where the work needs to be done; we know what work needs to be done; and we know there is plenty of it to be done. So while a 10,000 place REEP scheme is very welcome, it is a long way from being enough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Prime Minister should be out there talking to unemployed young people about what they think they should be doing in exchange for their benefits. I think he needs to hear from people like Tinah Hadley from Mullumbimby who came to see us yesterday to talk about her experience of being cut off unemployment benefits because she told the truth; because she said she was not out looking for non-existent work every day as she was trying to establish a business for herself. In her words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a growing group of out of work people who have realised that there are fewer jobs available than any rhetoric the Government may circulate and have taken it upon themselves to experiment and develop skills that will lead to their own employment and possibly employment prospects for other people.</PARA>
<PARA>She asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where is the differentiation between those who are unemployed and those who are attempting to create their own work?</PARA>
<PARA>People like Tinah will rightly ask why the white paper is so unadventurous in respect of people like her and why it contains such a paltry increase to the new enterprise initiatives scheme, instead of the doubling of places which the Democrats believe is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister needs to get out and talk to other young unemployed people about other than an increase in training. He needs to get out into regional Australia, like his mate Bill Kelty has done, and get some idea of the magnitude of suffering out there. If he has not done so&mdash;and I wonder whether he has&mdash;I think he needs to sit down and have a good chat to Bill Kelty because at least Bill Kelty talked to people and came up with some good ideas for solving some of the problems of rural Australia. But these ideas have been largely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the government's assertions to the contrary, the white paper does very little for regional Australia. Yes, the support for regional economic development organisations is welcome. Yes, there will be some employment benefits from the REEP program. But $10 million for regional infrastructure is an insult. Yes, it is good to see the long-awaited reform of infrastructure bonds, but do not hark back to pool development funds as the answer to everything. I am very sceptical about these bonds ever working because they do not click in until the investment makes a profit. Infrastructure and research require significant up-front investment, and we generally do not see the benefits and do not make a profit for many years. Governments know this, and they avoid taking that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The smart approach would have been to increase government up-front equity and increase government expenditure on infrastructure. I heard a comment today that the regional elements&mdash;such as they are in this package&mdash;add up to a committee-led recovery: in other words, out in the regions there is going to be a lot of talking, a lot of organising, a lot of meetings, and it is all supposed to be aimed at encouraging people to act. There is not much in the way of direct assistance. The white paper's message from the government to regional Australia is a pretty clear one: `the name of the game is self-help and, despite all our rhetoric, despite the way in which we have said that we are so committed to the role of regions, we do not see any reason to give regional Australia any special treatment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope Bill Kelty has been on the phone to Paul Keating and given him a bit of an earful about why he and Lindsay Fox wasted their time and the taxpayers' money developing a set of comprehensive proposals that the government could ignore. Bill Kelty's experience just about sums up the white paper because it is not as if the government has not had enough data upon which to rely. As the Prime Minister said, we have had 11 budgets, three ministerial statements, four major economic statements&mdash;a prodigious body of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has plenty of the evidence that it needs to radically rethink its direction but, instead of rising to the challenge and seeking the opportunity provided by the white paper to do something genuinely creative, it has come up with a piecemeal package that relies on growth. I have to say that I am very sceptical&mdash;and I think I have good reason to be, based on the evidence of the previous decade&mdash;about the ability of growth to ultimately deliver all the sorts of real jobs about which the government is speaking. The government has come up with a minimalist package&mdash;good rhetoric, full of symbolism, short on vision and substance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, one million Australians who are currently unemployed were offered a deal by the government which may help some, which will disadvantage the short-term unemployed, and which will miss the main point of any address on unemployment, which is getting policies right so that real, sustainable long-term jobs can be created. Over the next four years $6.5 billion of taxpayers' money will be directed to government incentives. The one million unemployed, including the 350,000 long-term unemployed and the 35 per cent of our youth who are unemployed or underemployed, deserve the nation's concern and assistance. They deserve a government initiative that will give them hope for a secure future in a job with all the social, family expectations that a regular job provides.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the only area where real hope features in this document is the hope practised by the government that it can find the $6.5 billion price of the package from increased growth in the economy, and that it can convince the Left of the Labor Party to sell all the federal government owned airports to finance the deal. The Prime Minister has called it a true Labor document; that it has the marks of Labor governments written all over it. We do not dispute that. We have had too many of them. We have had state Labor governments spending public money on plans and allowances without worrying about the long-term consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the $6.5 billion spending spree will cost jobs and not create them. What jobs does the government expect to be available when the six months subsidised wage scheme has finished? The government has put the focus on training. Even in the training area the government has failed to recognise that mickey mouse training courses are no substitute for proper vocational training. The government has not provided the necessary number of apprenticeships to provide a skilled youth work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The loss to the nation of a large group of long-term unemployed is a national tragedy. Unfortunately, this package does not address the issues which would have taken the final step of setting an environment where real jobs could be created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two coalition initiatives have been adopted: the suspension of the training guarantee levy and the training wage&mdash;although the final approval and figures on the training wage have not been given by the real masters of this government, the ACTU. The package will park slightly more than 300,000 off the unemployment figures; 220,000 have already been transferred to the wage subsidy program; 37,000 of 15- to 17-year-olds will be removed onto the new youth training allowance, with a further 35,000 over-60s removed onto the mature age allowance. Massive new bureaucracies will be created. The government might feel good about artificially removing hundreds of thousands off the dole queues. It looks good on paper, but it does not do a lot for anyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Labor government has given us 11 budgets, eight major economic statements and five employment statements. All have been presented in the most glowing and superlative terms, each one being the ultimate solution until the next one comes along and reveals otherwise. They have all been spectacular failures, despite all the money that has been thrown around. We are still left with unemployment of around 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This statement in glorious self-promotion is claimed by Mr Keating to be the biggest that the government has made since it won power in 1983. However, during the same 11-year period of labor governments, Australia has experienced some of the greatest cost increases to business and job losses of a magnitude not experienced since the Great Depression. We have seen a recession `we had to have', manufactured by the present Prime Minister, with tremendous loss of jobs. We are seeing massive relocation of manufacturing industry offshore; for example, $8 billion worth of industry in recent year has left the shores of New South Wales, let alone the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The McKinsey report on emerging exporters told the government that 13 per cent of firms surveyed had already set up offshore, with 50 per cent more considering a move in the near future. We have seen business on-costs cripple business, such as the superannuation guarantee levy, the training guarantee levy, and the social welfare demands of the ACTU&mdash;all resulting in lost jobs and lost job opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I told the Senate that the cost of labour in New Zealand was 69c a minute, whereas it costs 90c per minute in Australia to run a similar factory. We might be creating more elaborately transformed manufactures but we are losing our manufacturing base in less sophisticated manufacturing. We are also losing all the skills that maintained that manufacturing base. Put simply, we are losing all those jobs in the general engineering area and the process workers that go with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government cannot have it both ways. It demands that Australian industry be internationally competitive and take part in world markets, but the facts are that as tariffs have come off, imports have increased on a large scale. The government has continued to increase costs on Australian industry competing in the new cutthroat world marketplace. Australian industry not only goes offshore for the lower wage rates, but also for the benefits of tax holidays, factory investment incentives, free land, no duties or government charges&mdash;all forms of government incentives. We cannot afford to lose our manufacturing jobs. We cannot continue to increase charges and costs and throw red tape in the faces of existing manufacturers&mdash;because with their demise go our jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has continued on its destructive path for business and job prospects. Now we have a new industrial relations system which deters business from employing people because of the unbalanced dismissal provisions that it contains. I say unashamedly that this would have to be the greatest disincentive standing in the way of anyone wishing to employ people. Speaking as a former employer, I know that one must have room to move. Again, the government has tried to have it both ways. It cannot claim the credit for creating jobs, which are really only training positions, by spending $6.5 billion of taxpayers' money. Certainly it cannot make such claims when its policies have destroyed jobs and job growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Leader of the National Party in the Senate, I wish to refer to specific items in this package which affect rural and regional Australia and which must be addressed. It is alarming to see the two sentences in the package suggesting that the rural adjustment scheme is to be directed to meeting the structural adjustment needs of specific regions. Rural adjustment schemes must stay with the farm businesses that they are presently supporting. The RAS scheme is not a negotiable amount to be redirected by the government. The scheme must remain focused on farm businesses. The 15,000 farmers who are being helped through the present rural downturn will ensure that there is a strong, viable rural sector for Australia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The meagre RAS payments to 15,000 farmers&mdash;I think the figure is now less&mdash;to keep alive one of our major exporting industries is as justifiable an investment as the $6.5 billion investment of this package, but at the same time it is a lot cheaper. Without regional development, Australia will end like a doughnut, with a hole in the middle and certainly without a life-providing heart. The white paper will have little benefit for rural dwellers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers cannot afford to put anyone on, no matter what the subsidies. Rural traineeship schemes have proven to be of negligible help in solving rural unemployment. There are 4,000 to 4,500 farmers or their spouses currently receiving jobsearch allowance. This is usually the only buffer between the farming family and bankruptcy in hard times. The whole thrust of this white paper will be lost on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What training and work is the government to provide in depressed rural areas? The government in its white paper has made no specific mention of farm household support&mdash;support which is used by a few hundred farming families to keep food on the table but which becomes a loan after 9 months. Again, what training can be provided to people in isolated areas?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most inequitable features of the white paper is the impact the youth training allowance will have on the children of farmers. The government is replacing the jobsearch allowance for 15- to 17-year-olds with a youth training allowance, and also changing the eligibility criteria. Under the white paper, the Austudy personnel assets test and the parental income and assets test will now apply to the youth training allowance. It is impossible for the average farmer's children to qualify for Austudy. Time and again in the Senate we have seen the government move to restrict Austudy eligibility for rural children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, however, under the youth training allowance such children are to be assessed on the same basis as Austudy&mdash;on an inequitable test of their parents' assets. So rural children who cannot get Austudy now will not be able to get the youth training allowance. There will be a lower payment of $30.90 a week to be paid free of the parental income and assets test&mdash;a large shortfall on the $132.30 received by all off-farm 15- to 17-year-olds?</PARA>

At the same time much restructuring is needed in some rural industries. Industries such as the tobacco and citrus industries are in particularly urgent need. Both the tobacco and citrus industries have been victims of the GATT Uruguay Round resolution. The tobacco industry, which injects annually $50 million into the Mareeba-Dimbulah areas of north Queensland, will have its production requirements slashed to three million tonnes. </PARA>

After the taxpayer has funded the Kelty report on regional Australia, an Industry Commission report, the McKinsey report, and now this white paper, many questions are still left unanswered. For example, where does the government stand on the Kelty recommendation for an extra fuel tax for road funding. Rural communities stagger under the extra impost of fuel taxes. It is one of the great costs that are bleeding our industries in rural Australia. </PARA>

Australia will suffer the consequences for a long time to come of the decision of the Trade Practices Commission last year not to authorise the merger of Mackay Sugar Cooperative, E.D. and F. Man and CSR in the Mackay sugar refinery. This decision will deny Australia entry into the growing refined sugar export market.

While wishing for a solution to the queues of one million unemployed and the loss their plight represents for us all, it is hard to escape that the numbers of program participants who will go on to lasting non-subsidised jobs as a consequence of these measures will not improve on present trends. By the government neglecting to provide for stronger growth and the needs of industry and regional development, the white paper will do very little to address the deep-seated causes of Australia's major unemployment problem. </PARA>

Earlier today, I said that at the moment taxpayers are required to do quite a lot for business. There was a call for public participation in research and development. In many cases, business has stood with its hands behind its back and insisted that the government fund research and development. So bodies like CSIRO are now, by default, business research and development. In many cases, business requires government to do its training. This means that, once again, the taxpayer is subsidising training in lots of ways for business. Does business now require taxpayers to also fund its investment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have quite a problem with requests by the most powerful members of the business lobby&mdash;not all of them&mdash;making requests of government and how, in many instances, uncritical government has been of what is supposedly required to make business successful. Yet, with record profit levels and record salary levels for executives, that investment has not been forthcoming and the employment has not been forthcoming. Taxpayer funded subsidisation of business has not brought home the bacon in terms of whatever outcomes were meant to be provided to the government and the taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked a number of questions of the paper, such as, what is the government doing for the unemployed? Yes, it is offering to subsidise jobs to those who have been unemployed for 18 months&mdash;something like 350,000 places. The government is requiring that such jobs are accepted, it is creating an under award training wage and it is suspending the training guarantee under which industry agrees to contribute funding to some training.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government is not doing is creating jobs for the public or private sector. It is not ensuring that subsidised work leads to permanent work; it is not ensuring that subsidised work is a first step to a career path offering reasonable potential for bettering a position; and it is not ensuring that such work is not in a dead-end job. It is not ensuring that subsidised jobs do not lead to a reduction in normal jobs, so it cannot guarantee that there will not be a great deal of unemployment created by this so-called employment package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not ensuring that training wages do not exert a downward pressure on normal wages for the same or similar classes of work. Being a suspicious kind of character, I often have felt in the last day or so that that is exactly why many powerful people in the business lobby accept this package quite well&mdash;because they know the overall outcome is that there will be a very strong push to keep wages and conditions as low as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not providing any information at the moment about the rights of the unemployed in terms of being required to move, to take odious or ethically objectionable jobs, and so on. There are some things which nobody should be asked to do or there may be good reasons why people should not do them. We do not know what kind of conditions will or can be imposed under this kind of scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned that most of this $6.5 billion, on our estimation, is being done by mirrors. I will give an example. In the employment program there is a change, but we have to remember that from the previous year there was a cut of $425 million in the labour market programs. So when the white paper jobs compact promises $538, which is supposed to be the main part of this program, we have a net effect of $113 million. This is nothing like the billion dollars that has been mentioned in the public pronouncements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been so much talk of training programs, but the reality is that the change from the previous year's funding is $99 million. It is going down. The white paper promises $72.7 million. The net change is minus $26 million. How can the government provide training for everybody, when it is actually cutting its training funding by $26 million in the 1994-95 year?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the government doing for youth? It is eliminating the stages of unemployment for those under 18 and replacing unemployment benefits with a youth training allowance. The maximum amount is unspecified; the minimum could be as low as $31 a week. The government is means testing against parents' income. That is not done necessarily for the other program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is ensuring that there is industry acceptable training in schools for years 11 and 12. What the government is not doing is providing substantial increases to education budgets for additional expectations. How will the system be able to cope with this additional load? It is not ensuring that parents' income has any relevance to a young person's circumstance. It is not giving any assurance that the youth training allowance will be set at a level that is at least comparable to the current support. The government is not ensuring that the training allowance will not incorporate training in areas such as fast food work, which will be available only to trainees. So that means it is not going to offer them further positions in work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not ensuring that the training allowance is not administered in such a way that it will become a de facto below-award wage paid by the state for work in the private sector. There is a great concern that the widening of this test to the long-term unemployed means that there is that possibility. How would this be properly policed in businesses where people do not have much bargaining power or much confidence to be able to fight back? Entire work forces could be sacked and brought back on some form of training wage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the changes for youth. With respect to changes to Austudy, there is minus $145 million from the previous year. There is minus $4 million in the DSS savings on youth training. What we have for the 1994-95 year is minus $111 million.

It is moving towards privatising employment services. It is setting up a new bureau to set performance criteria, monitor delivery and distribute funds. It is cutting employer contributions to training. What the government is not doing is ensuring that there are additional jobs and funding to implement a case management approach so that it can do what it says it is going to do, which is probably one of the reasons why it is not starting this year. If there were an election this year and the government tried to do this without providing the funding, it would find that it would be very greatly embarrassed when people saw that it was not able to achieve what it said it could achieve with no money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not ensuring that it has sufficient funding to pay for the restructuring of the employment services and the establishment and running of the new bureau. It is not explaining how and why the private sector is assumed to be able to provide required services as good as or better than the public sector. I wonder how one would assess criteria in providing private sector participation. Would it be assessed by the cases handled or by the number of placements? If it is assessed by the cases handled, one wonders about the thoroughness of it. If it is assessed by the number of placements and we are looking at the private sector competing with the CES, does that mean that there will be a preference for those people who are more employable to be able to get the throughput for results in this private sector involvement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How will the private sector employment services be funded? The total change in employment services has risen a little.

The white paper promises $150 million extra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In income support, the government is changing social security to recognise spouses of the employed and both members of couples as individuals who may be eligible for benefits in their own right. The Greens certainly applaud this measure. It allows those in the category above who wish to look for work to be classed as unemployed and retain eligibility for benefits and training programs. Once again it is a measure for the better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government makes an equivalent allowance available to mothers or older women not caring for children who do not wish to work to maintain choice for women. It is changing the treatment of how income from part-time work affects unemployment benefits by reducing the free area and changing the 100 per cent taper to 70 per cent pre-tax. This is not recognising that reducing the benefits to 70 per cent of the pre-tax income means that it is reducing the benefits by 90 per cent of after tax income. People are allowed to keep only an additional 10c of every dollar they earn. This will often not outweigh additional expense, time and loss of benefits such as transport and medical discounts. So it will not achieve what I presume it is supposed to do, which is to encourage those people who have been on the unemployment roundabout to move towards economic self-sufficiency and skilling in the work force. If people see that they will not get the benefits for it, there will be very little incentive for them to do that. </PARA>

It is proposing major transport infrastructure projects and tailoring labour market programs to the needs of industry. </PARA>

I said that there were millions of Australians, not just those of Vietnamese origin, who fully agreed with a leading member of the Vietnamese Australian community who wrote to me to say that the invitation had `deeply insulted the honour and dignity of free Australian Vietnamese people'. I was about to add that it was especially insulting to those Vietnamese Australians who fled to Australia in the 1970s and 1980s to escape the very principles and practices of communism that Mr Do Muoi represents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a well-documented fact that the abuse of human rights in Vietnam still is greater than in most other countries. We have had the examples of the imprisonment of the buddhist monks and the hard labour imprisonment for many years of leading democratisation spokesmen like Dr Quan and Professor Hoat; and there are, as again is well documented, thousands of other prisoners of conscience in gaols around Vietnam. It is for that reason that successive Australian governments, at least until very recently, have taken a strong line on this matter. It is for this reason that both Prime Minister Keating and the Leader of the Opposition, Dr Hewson, raised with the Vietnamese Prime Minister, Mr Kiet, during his visit to Australia a year ago Australia's wish to send a human rights delegation to Vietnam to examine the human rights in situation there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Somewhat to my surprise, but very welcome nonetheless, Mr Kiet agreed to that proposal. As I recall it, a statement released at the conclusion of Mr Kiet's visit to Australia said that arrangements would be made for the delegation to visit Vietnam later that year, 1993. This visit has not yet eventuated. I was told several times by Senator Evans around June, July and August through to September last year that negotiations for the visit were proceeding satisfactorily. In answer to my question in the Senate on 16 November last, Senator Ray, who was then the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, said amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are in an advanced stage of putting the delegation together. . . There will be further discussions with the Vietnamese foreign ministry this week on the composition, objectives and itinerary of the delegation.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to timing, we are aiming for the week beginning 7 March 1994 and we will be doing what we can to ensure that there is no further slippage. . . We would find it strange if Prime Minister Kiet's personal undertaking were not soon followed up with action to facilitate this visit.</PARA>
<PARA>The expectations of Senator Ray and the government were not fulfilled. Two months after the date from which the government was seeking to ensure no further slippage&mdash;the first week of March this year&mdash;it appears that the delegation not only has not set out for Vietnam but its composition has not even been finalised. It appears from reports that both Senator Evans and Mr Keating discussed the delegation with their Vietnamese counterparts during their recent visits to that country. Mr Acting Deputy President, I am sure you would agree that the Senate has a right to know&mdash;as do the Australian people&mdash;the outcome of those discussions. Unofficial reports have been somewhat disturbing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put some questions about the delegation to the government. They demand answers. I am told that Senator Evans may respond later in this debate. I hope he will be able to answer the following questions about the proposed delegation. Firstly, what discussions did he and the Prime Minister have with the Vietnamese government on this matter during their recent visits to Vietnam? Secondly, what are the reasons for the long delays that have occurred to date? Thirdly, when will the composition of the delegation be finalised and announced? What will it be called? As is pointed out in the motion we are debating, it is reported to be called a consultative delegation, with no reference in the title to human rights. Fourthly, will it be concerned solely with the examination of human rights in Vietnam? If not, what proportionate role will the examination of human rights in Vietnam play in the delegation's work and itinerary? Fifthly, and most importantly, when will the delegation visit Vietnam? I hope we will get some responses today to those questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In concluding my remarks, I do not want to suggest in any way that Australia should not be building relations with Vietnam. On the contrary, it should. I hope the parliamentary delegation to Vietnam six months ago, of which I had the pleasure to be a member, did contribute to that process. But the point I want to make very strongly is that we will not help our cause, or that of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, by compromising our views on human rights or by ignoring our moral obligations and the concerns and feelings of the Australian and Vietnamese people. </PARA>

That involvement was wrong in moral terms, political terms and in terms of our relationship with the region. I am proud that I was there. I saw what Sir Robert Askin's police did that day. I saw what Sir Robert Askin's police did to a whole lot of young people in a peaceful demonstration in George Street.

Maybe turning back the clock will succeed. It has been moved for the crudest electoral objectives, the crudest possible electoral aims. The crudest possible electoral consequences are what are in mind with this motion. There is no merit in the proposition whatsoever. The prime ministerial visit to Vietnam was an enormous success by any criteria that anyone cares to devise or employ.

No memorandum or telegram has ever been discovered. A weekend Saigon government supposedly asked Australia to contribute troops to the conflict.

We can just see this proposition being sent around to a number of Australian-Vietnamese community groups, again with the coalition beating its chest over what might have been 25 or 30 years ago. It was the job of the Labor government in 1972 to pick up the pieces of the Vietnamese fiasco in so far as our involvement in that appalling conflict was concerned. It is now the job of the Labor government to take the relationship forward in a realistic way and on the basis of a mutual respect in focusing on common goals. </PARA>

In respect of political expression, freedom of religion, the rights of trade unions to organise, and of the freedom of association, I believe that there has to be a core element in the relationship, particularly in so far as the Buddhist community is concerned, for example. I am on the record publicly on that issue. I expect to be on the record publicly again next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the motion before the chamber, moved by my colleague Senator Short, and to commend him for the sentiments and statements that he made. I was interested in Senator Loosley's reply. I think Senator Loosley does have, or has had until today, a justified reputation for being thoughtful in the area of foreign affairs and for taking a great interest in it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested in Senator Loosley's remarks about Vietnam and the debates of the 1960s. I regularly go to Vietnamese functions. I like to think I have close links with the Vietnamese community. There are always flags flying when I go to those functions. The Vietnamese community love their flags. The flag that regularly flies is the old flag of South Vietnam. Labor speakers who marched in those marches in the 1960s, who did so much to bring down that flag, are now very happy to speak on podiums draped in those flags. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley was becoming emotional about the old debates about Vietnam and I think that reflects the deeply held views. Historians and senators in this chamber will always have great debates on this issue. Recently, a member of the Vietnamese community commented to me that during previous Chinese invasions of Vietnam and during the Japanese occupation of Vietnam the Vietnamese people stayed home. What was unique about the communist takeover of Vietnam was that a million Vietnamese took to the boats. Whether or not that war was prosecuted with good intentions&mdash;I generally believe it was&mdash;it is evident that it was not prosecuted successfully. As a result, large numbers of the Vietnamese community took to the seas. The tragedies that were involved with that continue today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of that war Vietnam came under communist rule. Vietnam is still one of the poorest nations in that region. It has had a pitiful record of growth during the same period as the Asian tigers, as they are called, have been able to deliver massive improvements in living standards to their people.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley confirmed that human rights abuses in Vietnam are absolutely appalling. Freedom House rates countries on the basis of the freedoms and liberties their people enjoy, and Vietnam is amongst the bottom 12 in the world. Senator Loosley was perhaps a little harsh in his description of the motives for the war. The prosecution of the war led to a defeat and the results of that defeat were catastrophic for the Vietnamese people. They were also catastrophic for the families of the diggers who lost their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings me to the first part of Senator Short's motion. Judging by comments and newspaper articles, there was widespread consensus in the Australian community that in Vietnam Mr Keating should have made a recognition of the diggers. I think Mr Keating effectively conceded that point during his last day in Vietnam. It was a blunder. An attempt was made in the final 24 hours of his visit to correct that blunder. Whatever one's position is on the Vietnam War, these men were there on behalf of Australia and their memory deserves to be honoured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the French, with the 50th anniversary of the battle at Dien Bien Phu in the next year or so, have spoken to the Vietnamese. French soldiers are being allowed to parachute into the old area. The French have established very close links with the communist Vietnamese government, and there are no worries about celebrations to mark the history of their people in that country. Equally, the Americans are seeking to establish closer links and are very vigorous at pursuing human rights issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of Senator Short's motion reflects community sentiment that there should have been a gesture to mark the service of the diggers in Vietnam. It was a great pity it did not happen. In the last 24 hours of his visit Mr Keating backtracked, and that was welcomed by the Australian community. </PARA>

Senator Loosley sees this as an attempt to divide the Australian community. I am not sure where the division comes in. It seems to me that there was widespread support within the Australian community for recognition of the diggers in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, the Vietnamese community in Australia was concerned about the invitation to Mr Do Muoi. The editorials in the Vietnamese newspapers, to my mind, reflect that. I certainly support the view. I am completely unclear why an invitation was offered to this man. He is not a head of state. It is grossly offensive to the Vietnamese community. I think Senator Short was quite right to draw our attention to that and to indicate that this invitation, insensitive as it is, shows a degree of contempt for the feelings of the Vietnamese community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure where the division comes in. The division comes in because the Australian community simply does not accept or understand the behaviour of Mr Keating in relation to Vietnam. I thought that Greg Sheridan of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> summed up the position quite well and perhaps helps to explain why the Labor government&mdash;and Mr Keating in particular&mdash;acts in this manner. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is right that we encourage the Vietnam reform process now under way&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>No-one argues with that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but it is extremely odious that this regime should become the third largest recipient of our aid program. Keating, coming so late to the consciousness of Asia, must be the only politician left in the world who is actually still sentimental about Vietnamese communism.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that insight shows us how the Labor Party has tripped over itself in relation to Vietnam. The sentiments that Mr Keating feels are simply not shared by the Vietnamese community in Australia nor by the vast proportion of Australians. There is no argument within the Australian community that there should have been some recognition of the diggers in Vietnam. I ask Senator Loosley, where is the division there? Equally, the Vietnamese community is opposed to the visit of Mr Do Muoi&mdash;there is no division there&mdash;and we support it. Listening to Senator Loosley's emotional speech, I kept thinking, where is the division? The division is between the narrow clique that runs the government and the vast proportion of the Australian people. That has clearly been demonstrated on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not doubt Senator Loosley's commitment to human rights. He said that human rights should be central to our policy on Vietnam. Why, then, are we able to give the Vietnamese government over $300 million? If we add up the dollars already given to Vietnam and the dollars that have been promised by Mr Keating it comes to $300 million being given to this government. Where is the advantage in human rights? Where is the leverage that we have attempted to use on human rights? The reports I get from the Vietnamese community are that, if anything, the human rights position in Vietnam has deteriorated over the last 12 months. Yet Mr Keating promises another $200 million of aid to this odious government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government maintains over 800,000 men in uniform. It is, next to China, the largest armed force in the region. What is one of the poorest countries in South-East Asia doing maintaining an army of that massive size? Why is Australia, with its armed forces of 60,000 or 70,000, providing such vast amounts of aid to this country which spends 11 per cent of its very low gross domestic product on maintaining massive armed forces?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to go down this track to make Vietnam one of the largest recipients of our aid program, maybe Senator Evans could have raised the question: `Should you maintain such vast forces?' I find it offensive, I think the Australian community will find it offensive, and Australians of Vietnamese origin will find it offensive, that a government which is one of the biggest spenders on military hardware, which maintains over 800,000 men and women in uniform, should become the recipient of such vast amounts of Australian dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept what Senator Loosley said&mdash;that human rights should be central. What he did not demonstrate in his speech is how human rights are central to Australia's Vietnamese policy. He did not stand up and say, `This is what Mr Keating said over there. This is what he said in relation to our aid program. This is what he said about the large numbers of Buddhist monks, Christians and others in the re-education camps. This is what he said about that.' That is what was lacking in his speech. He stated the slogan and it sounded good, but it lacked content. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Evans is going to speak on this matter, I would like him in his remarks to address how human rights are central to our programs in Vietnam and how these vast amounts of Australian dollars that we are giving to the Vietnamese government will deliver better human rights. Equally, I would like him to address the issue of whether Mr Keating raised with the Vietnamese the oddity of their seeking massive aid from Australia whilst spending 11 per cent of their gross domestic product on maintaining one of the largest armed forces in the world. I think that is a fair question and I look forward to hearing the response of Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no division in the community on the issues raised by Senator Short. There is no division in the community that it would have been appropriate for a mark of recognition to the diggers to be made during Mr Keating's visit. In the last 24 hours of his visit Mr Keating confirmed that, in my view. From the information I have received, I do not believe there is any division in the Vietnamese community that the visit of Do Muoi is offensive. Senator Loosley says this has been done for electoral gain. I do not think that is the case. The Vietnamese community are entitled to feel offended by this and they are entitled to have their representatives in the parliament speak out on their behalf. </PARA>

I do not say in any of that that any of the responsibility for the shame that I feel should be borne by the Australian soldiers who served in Vietnam.

It has been denied any form of assistance from the United States, Japan and other countries following the United States leadership. It may be that some of that was brought on Vietnam's own head by some of the policy decisions it took during that period&mdash;in particular, the invasion of Cambodia, which led Australia itself, I think quite properly, to sever the aid relationship as a consequence of that.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is in no doubt about the kind of relationship it wants with Vietnam.

The Prime Minister came away from that visit with a very firm belief that he had established a new foundation for the relationship. Certainly the nature, character and pace of Vietnam's economic and political integration into the region will be one of the big issues for us all over the next few years. The Prime Minister offered firm Australian support for this process. His discussions with Prime Minister Kiet, with President Anh and General Secretary Do Muoi ranged very broadly over bilateral relations, regional developments and global issues and certainly included discussions on a number of the specific human rights issues which I have raised and discussed on many occasions with my Vietnamese interlocutors&mdash;issues which we will continue to discuss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We particularly acknowledged and appreciated the expression of appreciation that came from President Anh about the assistance that the Australian government had given to the development of the Vietnamese community in Australia.

This is not some individual who plays a marginal role in the government of the country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get enough letters from former political prisoners and former clerics who have been in detention or who have been denied the capacity to practice their religion to make me confident that at least on the margin the kinds of representations that Australia has been making have been more effective than the kind of bluster that Senator Kemp and those who think like him can muster on these occasions. It is important to be productive, not counterproductive, in the strategy of the approach we adopt towards human rights. It is important to get these issues out on the table, and that is exactly what we believe should be done. That brings me to the question of the delegation about which Senator Short gets so indignant and uptight in his contributions on these particular occasions. I am now able to say to Senator Short and to the Senate that the outstanding issues that have delayed previously the implementation of the agreement in principle during Prime Minister Kiet's visit to Australia last year have been resolved. </PARA>

It will be lead by Senator Stephen Loosley, Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Senator Vicki Bourne of the Australian Democrats and the Hon.

Two academics noted for their expertise in Asian affairs and human rights have been included. They are Professor Nancy Viviani, Dean of the Faculty of Asian and International Studies at Griffith University, and Professor Philip Alston, Director of the Centre for International and Public Law at the Australian National University, who is a recognised international authority on human rights law and is currently chair of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, a very distinguished Australian&mdash;notwithstanding some unfortunate family associations!&mdash;and someone who has made a major contribution to the international dialogue and understanding on those matters. </PARA>

We have thus included, and the Vietnamese government has agreed to accept as part of the delegation, two prominent and highly regarded Vietnamese Australians in the delegation. One of them is Mr Quang Luu, the head of SBS radio, based in New South Wales, and someone whom I know Senator Short has the highest regard for, both as an individual and as an outstanding leader of the Vietnamese community here in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other one, for geographical and other kinds of balances, is Ms Ho Mai, a young woman of considerable distinction in the way in which she has settled into the Australian community.

The delegation is a strong one; it is a well balanced one, and I am confident that it has the necessary status and expertise to carry out its mandate in an exemplary fashion. We look forward to that delegation proceeding in July and engaging in dialogue in the way that is intended. </PARA>

The Prime Minister spoke, and spoke very movingly, before he went to Vietnam and again while he was there, of the way in which those Australians who fought in Vietnam had done so with the same faith in Australia and commitment to their country as those who had fought in other wars, other wars which he and I would regard as more just wars than the one that we fought in Vietnam.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did go through the Vietnam War years in a way that was divisive to Australia. I spent a lot of time and energy opposing the war and seeking to have us pull out of Vietnam. On occasions I even spent time as a guest of the Queensland police in the watch-house as a result of those efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was certainly insulted by the Special Branch, which kept a record on me for quite a long time. I also had many arguments: as a union official, I argued very vigorously with members of our union about the rights and wrongs of the war. Many of those members, of course, were concerned about their sons being caught up in a war that had nothing to do with Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at Vietnam, a motion like this reopens the merits of the case. It is important to note that, during the Second World War, Ho Chi Minh and the people who fought with him fought against the Japanese and were the allies of America, the United Kingdom, ourselves, the French government in exile, and others. At the same time, certain Vietnamese and the French who were allied with the Vichy French in South Vietnam collaborated with the Japanese. At one stage, when the colony reverted back to the French after the war, even Macarthur sent a telegram saying that it was the greatest sell-out of an ally that he had ever heard of; he was deadly opposed to it.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even then, the French could not hold on to their colony. Dien Bien Phu has already been mentioned: there the French were defeated by a superior ally. However, the defeat of the French was more the result of the conviction of the people wanting freedom and independence for their own country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the Paris discussions and the division at the 54th parallel. Everyone thought it was peace at last and that an independent Vietnam could be worked out. But, of course, that did not happen. The Americans sought to pick up where the French had left off by sending in what they called `advisers', which gradually escalated the conflict. Sadly, there was no merit in the argument for the involvement of Australia. As Holt put it at the time, it was clearly, `All the way with LBJ' which encapsulated our whole position. We were with the Americans; we were opposed to the communists in Vietnam. Anybody who opposed the government in South Vietnam, which was totally corrupt, was considered a communist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us, for a moment, look at a couple of the pillars of society in Vietnam. Ngo Dinh Diem tried to steal heaps of money and was totally corrupt. Air Vice Marshal Ky was a corrupt person. None of them went in with any merit, and the people around them made lots of money out of the American troops and everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that our people should not have been there. I agree with Senator Gareth Evans: that is no reflection on those people who went. If I had been of a particular age, I would not have gone and I would have accepted the consequences of law in this country. But very few volunteers went to Vietnam&mdash;mostly it was the ballot and conscription. It was pretty unfair to conscript young men from this country to fight in a foreign country 8,000 miles away in a war that was not ours&mdash;in a war that most fair-thinking people in this country believed should not have taken place because the Vietnamese should have been granted independence. But that is the merit of the argument. I obviously know the history of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, at the end of the war we did pull out as a result of a decision of the Labor government. Obviously, we had lost an election on the misguided beliefs of the electorate some years before on the particular question. While that was not the only question, it was certainly an important one. By 1972 the people had realised the real merit of our arguments and they supported a Labor government. As a result of the election of that government, we pulled out of Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One would have thought that we should all have looked at the process of healing. Some came back from the war; some did not come back. It certainly was not the fault of the anti-Vietnam war forces in this country. There was always some sort of argument about whether they got proper recognition by the government. Finally, they did get quite a bit of recognition in a whole number of ways, which I think they should. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I echo the view that many people went over in the belief that it was the thing to do. I do not knock that. Everybody is entitled to have a view. If they are wrong, they are wrong. If they are right, they are right. But it means that they at least have integrity in that belief. They are not hypocrites who think one thing and do another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people were defending their country. We went 8,000 miles away to get involved in the conflict, and many other people went further. It was a French colony but the French were not prepared to go any further. They did not contribute after they pulled out. The British did not get involved. </PARA>

It needs to be said that, regardless of the arguments for or against the Vietnam War, this lost war&mdash;and in many ways a disgraceful war&mdash;our service personnel should never be forgotten. And they were forgotten. Regardless of how Senator Gareth Evans tried to gloss over this matter, we have forgotten.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was never explained why our fallen diggers were not recognised by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) during his visit to Vietnam. He was the first Prime Minister to visit Vietnam since that war, so it was a significant occasion. The damage has now been done, regardless of a late effort by the Prime Minister to cover the outrage that was going on in Australia while he was over there. Australians are unconvinced by the Prime Minister's late efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Evans's information, he should know that there are Australians lying buried in Vietnam.

He boasted, as did many other members of the government, of the Vietnam War shaping his politics and shaping his very being. That is good; that is fair enough&mdash;but he must also then take the responsibility and the guilt for never welcoming home these troops, for sending them away into the bowels of our society, and in some cases even spitting on them. They were not recognised in any homecoming until 1987.

It should be added that neither the march nor the memorial was organised by this government; it was organised by the Vietnam veterans themselves. For that matter, the government did not even tip the money into it. I believe the memorial ended up a dollar for dollar contribution. The government did not generate any homecoming for our Vietnam veterans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister joins the ranks of the likes of Senator Loosley in having the politics of that day shaping his politics today.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today I advised the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, that I would be raising a number of issues relating to the letting of the contract for the Maralinga clean-up, which was announced by him tonight. I did not ask Senator Collins to come down and endure one of my adjournment speeches, but I did ask him to tune in because I wanted to ask a number of serious questions which could not be fitted into a one-minute question during question time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement by the minister of the successful tenderer, being the Australian Construction Services, a wholly-owned government trading body, last Friday&mdash;30 April&mdash;was the last event in a long line of events which commenced in about 1953 with the explosion of a number of nuclear devices by the British at Maralinga, Emu and associated areas over the ensuing 10 years. In 1967 the British conducted an operation called Operation Brumby to clean up the site. It was an operation which was only semi-successful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 the McClelland Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests was established and in 1986 the technical assessment group, which was a recommendation of that royal commission, was further established, which group tabled a report in the Senate on 15 November 1990. That was an excellent report widely acknowledged by scientific communities and engineering communities around the world as breaking new ground in assessment of these sorts of nuclear risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1993 or thereabouts, DPIE placed an advertisement calling for registrations of interests to conduct the clean-up of the Maralinga site. The closing date for registration of interests was 29 October 1993, and there were about 38 registrations of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1993, the 38 registrations of interest were brought down to a short list of three. In mid-January 1994&mdash;just a few months ago&mdash;those successful people on the short list conducted an inspection of the Maralinga site over a period of three days. On 4 February 1994, the actual tenders closed. In mid-February, clarification talks were held in relation to the tenders because, as senators could imagine, there are a number of complicated issues involved in cleaning up a site like Maralinga. In early March, there were responses to those clarification talks and in mid-March there were interviews with the tenderers. But by the second week of April there was broad scuttlebutt around the engineering industry and the people involved with the tenders that the contract had gone to ACS and everyone else was wasting their time. As I said, the announcement of the successful tenderer, being the Australian Construction Services, was made last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put out a press release saying that I would like an investigation into whether or not the tender was fair and open and whether all the tenderers were playing on a level playing field. As Senator McMullan and I both know, the Australian Construction Services is going through a commercialisation process. It has lost something like $100 million over the last five years and specifically has been the recipient of approximately $60 million in taxpayer subsidies of one form or the other in the last three years. I will come to that a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task involved in the Maralinga clean-up is an enormous one, and cost estimates to do the task successfully vary from $80 million up to over $500 million. However, current estimates based on the TAG report show that the task will cost in the vicinity of $100 million&mdash;a not insignificant amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task for the first phase, which has been awarded to ACS as from Friday, basically involves project design and management. This is a complicated phase involving preliminary design work, detailed cost estimates, specification of the various work packages involved in the clean-up and, very importantly, the health physics or, as we know it in the broader world outside the nuclear industry, occupational health and safety matters which are crucial when dealing with 22 kilograms of plutonium and when the people who will be at work on the site are exposed to enormous risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The physical job involves a number of pieces of work. Effectively, the big task is to shift about 500,000 cubic metres of contaminated earth and to spread a lot of that earth into decontaminated areas in order to bring the radiation risks down to what are known as background levels. In this way traditional owners and inhabitants of that area are able to go about their normal lifestyles without being exposed to a radiation risk. I inform the Senate that that earth is spread over an area of 2.1 square kilometres&mdash;a very large piece of central Australia which is some 270 kilometres north of Ceduna in Senator Lees's constituency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant tasks are to provide support services for this massive clean-up. There are also some highly contaminated materials which will have to be compacted into pits and then disposed of or stabilised using a process called in situ vitrification, which is effectively sticking a couple of great big electrodes into it, zapping an enormous current through it, turning it all into glass, making it safe and getting rid of it. That is a technology that is still being developed. When this takes place at Maralinga over the next few years it will be one of the first times this technology has been used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other parts of the program include the rehabilitation of the Maralinga town site to create a work camp for up to 500 people who will be employed on the task over the next six years. There are enormous risks associated with those working on the site. The design task for the project manager is a massive one. The risks associated with that work must be minimised for the workers at Maralinga. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of questions need to be asked in relation to the granting of this tender to the ACS. I have dealt with the issue of competitive neutrality. I have dealt with the issue of the $60 million losses that it has made. Two other key points need to be identified. Did Australian Construction Services have to make an allowance in its bid for indemnity insurance for those who work on the site? To insure for such a risk is an extremely expensive exercise, costing hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. The two private sector bidders had to find that insurance. The question that needs to be answered is this: did the ACS have to make a provision for that cost or is the Commonwealth assuming what will be an open-ended risk, which will put taxpayers in Australia at risk for generations to come with respect to the unfortunate instance of people making claims for radiation or other mishaps on the site?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The private sector bidders were asked to put up a $3 million performance bond to ensure that the work was done on time and on cost, which is something that the ACS has had trouble achieving on many of its projects. The cost of putting up a $3 million performance bond, as you would know, Mr Acting Deputy President, is also very expensive. People do not just go to a bank and get a $3 million performance bond given to them without some cost to their future borrowing capacity. A facility fee is involved, which I am informed is upwards of two per cent per annum. It is an extremely expensive cost that the private sector bidders have to meet. I would like to know whether Australian Construction Services had to meet such a bid in its tender.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to know who comprised the assessment team. I would like to know whether those on the tender assessment team had any previous experience in assessing tenders. Had they any previous expertise in project management? Had they any previous expertise in remote location project design and management? Had they any previous experience in the cleaning up of radioactive sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to know whether the officers in the assessment team at DPIE had ever run a tender process before and, if so, which tenders. I would like to know whether cost was a crucial element in the awarding of the tender to the ACS. I would like to know who made the decision and why the decision was made to short-list only three people out of 38 registrations. I would like to know whether a long list was established and, if so, whether those who made the long list were given the opportunity to come back and address their submissions or any perceived weaknesses in their submissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to know what experience Australian Construction Services had in running complex nuclear test site clean-ups. I would also like to know what experience Australian Construction Services had in running major remote location projects of this type. I would also like the minister to answer whether or not it is true that the ACS has had some major project management and control problems in projects such as Tindal in the Northern Territory, the Sydney Central project in Sydney, and recently at the SAS barracks in Swanbourne in Western Australia. I would like the minister to be able to answer those questions over the next few days because I think they are crucially important to the future of Australia. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="389" SPEAKER="Lees Sen M.H." NAMEID="8U4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8U4">Senator LEES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia-</ELECTORATE><ROLE>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats)</ROLE><TIME.STAMP> (7.30 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise again tonight to talk about the rural crisis and, in particular, to talk about what is happening in my home state of South Australia. I want to concentrate tonight on a report that was released into the South Australian parliament yesterday on rural poverty in South Australia. It is only an interim report. It has been prepared by the Social Development Committee, and it is now proceeding to put together the final document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must stress here that this inquiry was welcomed by the Australian Democrats. Indeed, one of our members from the South Australian Legislative Council, Sandra Kanck, was on the committee that did this work. When the committee got into all the facts and figures, it found that very little is known about the dimensions of poverty in rural Australia. Most of the work by ACOSS and other organisations, including the setting up of the Henderson poverty line, has been done in the cities. With that focus on the metropolitan area, there really is very little data, particularly recent data, on what is actually happening in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to spend my time tonight looking specifically at the submission from the Murray-Mallee community representatives to this committee. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These witnesses described:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.the effect the rural crisis was having on children and the health of people in the region;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.that there was increasing social isolation, especially among women; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">.that some farmers were being forced to use non-sustainable land management practices because of pressure from banks to repay loans.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to begin by looking at the first section of the submission, that is, the impact on children. I quote the submission again:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to witnesses, some children blamed themselves for their family's financial difficulties. Believing that they were a financial drain on the family, the Committee was told that some children had approached their school counsellor to find out how they could be adopted or fostered out. It was also reported that the rural crisis was placing a severe psychological strain on children and that a number had attempted to commit suicide:</PARA>
<PARA>I quote here from evidence that was presented to the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These issues have created emotional traumas within the children . . . They would hear their parents arguing about the fact that they may lose the farm which means that they will probably lose their home . . . They hear their fathers particularly talking about burning the place, burning the bank, shooting the bank manager or shooting themselves. Whilst in some instances this is said more in jest, the kids take it very seriously.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the children become very anxious and frightened and may find themselves powerless. In some cases I am told that they have blamed themselves: they feel the costs they are imposing on their parents are too much at this time.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also heard detailed submissions on the fact that farmers can now no longer afford to employ labour, and so greater and greater stress is being placed on families and, in particular, greater demands are being placed on children to help around the farm and do farm work. I quote again from the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee heard further that some children were having to work excessively long hours and that they were being given an undue amount of responsibility to generate extra farm income and pay their own way:</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from evidence:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have documented evidence of some children driving tractors for between 200 and 300 hours during the seeding season. We also have evidence of kids who, having been given a sense of responsibility by raising a small litter of piglets, are now looking after the piggery. Whereas they may have been raising three or four bobby calves, they are now raising 10 or 15 to try to increase the earning capacity of the farm and pay their own way.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result children were going to school tired, which was affecting their school work. At the same time parents were telling their children that there was no future in farming and that they needed to do well at school so they could get a job or go on to further study.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was also told that some school children were resorting to stealing from other students to get enough food to eat.</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from the evidence as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there are kids stealing food, and that is not something we have experienced before in the terms of hunger. There are children now . . . who are actually stealing from their classmates simply because they are hungry and that is a phenomenon we have not experienced before.</PARA>
<PARA>I move on to what the committee was told about the use of medications in this particular area of South Australia. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To illustrate the effect that the rural recession was having on the health of Murray-Mallee residents, the committee was given information by a pharmacist about changes in the level of medication use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This showed significant increases in the use of prescription medication, particularly for drugs used to treat stress related conditions. For example, comparing the years 1987 and 1992 it was reported that there had been a 104% increase in the number of prescriptions for migraine medication, a 140% increase for anti-depressants and hypnotics, and a 515% increase in medications for treating ulcers.</PARA>
<PARA>And that does not include antacids. I wish quickly to look at isolation as another issue. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee heard that a further effect of the rural recession was increasing social isolation. The high cost of fuel meant that people made fewer trips to go shopping or visit friends; telephone use was also restricted because of the cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee was told that rural women were particularly vulnerable to social isolation as they encountered `pressure from husbands to stay at home and not use the telephone.' This compounds their difficulties because it reduces their access to the very services and facilities that would help them cope with their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>Finally, with regard to the Murray-Mallee submission, I want to look at the impact of the recession on farm management practices. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A soil conservation officer told the committee that owing to poverty and debt repayment pressures, some farmers were using non-sustainable land management practices in an effort to generate as much immediate income as possible. It was stated that these practices were detrimental to the long term viability of the land.</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . Landcare is marking time while the recession is on. People are applying short term solutions because of poverty. In other words, they are mining the soil rather than taking on long term strategies for management . . . we are concerned about the falling nutrient levels of the soil and the fact that some of these farmers are being forced to adopt non sustainable land management practice . . . weeds, vermin and erosion are increasing in locations and, as a board, we have a concern about that.</PARA>
<PARA>I would now like to move on to some of the evidence presented by rural counsellors. The submission states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was told that many primary producers were experiencing severe financial difficulties owing to the increased costs and declining returns on their commodities. The rural counsellor from the Murraylands told the Committee that the situation had become so serious that in that area she had recently delivered two food parcels. She commented that, `I have never had to do that .</PARA>
<PARA>I have experience of travelling in rural South Australia and I have been in areas with rural counsellors who regularly deliver food parcels. In particular, I note that food parcels are sent down from church groups in Adelaide to farmers on Kangaroo Island who do not have enough to eat. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rural counsellor from the Yorke Peninsula informed the Committee that many of the properties in his area were being run down by farmers who could not afford to maintain farm infrastructure and capital works programs. For example, it was reported that many farmers were operating with old, dangerous and inefficient machinery, that fencing and other capital works were having to be postponed indefinitely and that many farm houses were in urgent need of repair . . . It was reported that many farmers could not even consider the option of selling their properties as a way out of their financial problems because the sale price of the property, when&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and if&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it was eventually sold, would be too low to allow them to clear their debts and leave the industry with any financial security. The Committee was told many farm families felt a sense of helplessness and anger about their financial situation, and that they felt powerless to do anything to change their circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I will conclude my remarks with some comments from the rural counsellors about the regionalisation of services. This is something I think we are going see more of under the Brown government, from the comments in yesterday's Adelaide <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Advertiser</EMPHASIS> about what the government perceives as the problem, with the only solution being to cut services further. The submission continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was argued that because of regionalisation people in need of assistance were not using social security services.</PARA>
<PARA>The evidence states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Geographic isolation from service agencies also adds to the social poverty experienced by individuals and communities. Individuals particularly tend not to seek out assistance as they feel the financial cost associated with obtaining assistance or treatment is not worth the effort.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee was told that the perceived financial benefits of regionalisation often left behind a `service poor' population with massive social problems. According to witnesses, the continued survival of some country towns was being threatened by the decentralisation of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I will simply comment on what the government has done in the white paper&mdash;basically nothing. What do we get? We get $10 million this year for two demonstration projects. I ask the Senate: what is that if it is not an insult?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a claim by Dr Byrne for damages as a result of injuries sustained in an aircraft accident. Dr Byrne alleges that the CAA was negligent, in that it failed to keep a proper lookout for the aircraft he was flying; failed to warn him of his position relative to the runway; failed to monitor the position of the aircraft; failed to communicate with the aircraft; and advised Dr Byrne incorrectly as to his approach. These proceedings were commenced in 1993. The CAA was served with the Statement of Claim on 6 April 1994. The FAC is also a defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Terrence Richard Worrell</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This case is a District Court action commenced by Mr Worrell in Sydney. It relates to a claim by him against several parties, for damages arising out of the purchase of an aircraft. Insofar as the CAA is concerned, it is alleged that the CAA negligently issued a Certificate of Airworthiness when (it is alleged) the aircraft was not airworthy. The plaintiff, relying upon that Certificate of Airworthiness at the time of purchase, has, as a result of the aircraft being unairworthy, suffered loss and damage. This action is well advanced into the interlocutory stages. No date has yet been set down for trial.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Robert Houston</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a claim for damages arising out of injuries allegedly suffered by the plaintiff as a result of three accidents. These accidents occurred during the course of his employment with both the former Department and the CAA. Amongst the allegations are that the CAA failed to provide a safe system of work. The CAA was served with the Writ in July 1993. The action is at the interlocutory stages.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a claim for damages for injuries arising out of an accident which occurred on 14 October 1990, whilst the plaintiff, Ross Kerridge, was employed by Careflight Ltd (also a defendant in these proceedings) as a medical practitioner. The CAA is one of four defendants in the action. So far as the claim relates to the CAA, the allegations are that the CAA was negligent, in that it approved the use of cable-cutting devices in helicopters. The device in this instance failed, and Mr Kerridge was injured. This action is at the interlocutory stage. Defences have been filed by the CAA and Careflight Ltd only.</PARA>

The deceased was a co-pilot of VH-CAG. The plaintiff seeks damages pursuant to the Compensation to Relatives Act (NSW) 1897. The plaintiff alleges that it was Mr Lord's (the pilot's) negligence that caused the crash of VH-CAG, and as Mr Lord was an employee of the CAA, the CAA is vicariously liable for his negligence. The plaintiff also alleges negligence/breach of statutory duty against the CAA. This action has only just been commenced. No significant steps have been taken.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stephen James Doggett</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA is one of 7 defendants in these proceedings. The plaintiff is claiming damages for injuries suffered as a result of an accident which occurred on 22 December 1990. The plaintiff was a passenger on Cessna VH-PLD. That aircraft had been deployed in a search and rescue operation which was being conducted at Camden. There are allegations of negligence against the CAA in relation to the way it conducted the search. The proceedings are on hold at the moment, at the request of the plaintiff, who is awaiting the outcome of other proceedings which were commenced in the United States. The CAA is not a party to those latter proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) and (2) Monarch Airlines Limited (Applicant), Polaris Holding Company (Applicant) and Canadian Airlines International Ltd (Applicant)</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Compass Airlines went into liquidation on 20 December 1991. At that time, it owed the CAA approximately $12.5 million for aviation charges. The charges were incurred in respect of each of the five aircraft that Compass had been operating during 1991. Those aircraft were leased to Compass by the above three parties (all Canadian companies). As the charges remained unpaid, the CAA imposed statutory liens upon the craft. In order for the above parties ("the lessors") to remove the aircraft from Australia, the lessors were obliged to pay the charges.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1992, the lessors commenced actions in the High Court, seeking recovery of the amounts paid on a number of bases. The allegations were essentially that the charges were not related to expenses incurred by the CAA; that the charges amounted to taxation, and therefore, the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act were invalid by reason of Section 55 of the Constitution; that the operation of the Statutory Lien provisions of the Act were contrary to Section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution. The actions were formally remitted to the Federal Court by Justice Deane on 28 April 1993. The proceedings are at the interlocutory stage.</PARA>
