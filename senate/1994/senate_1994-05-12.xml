<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advised that, among other things, the Determination revoked the earlier Determination No. TAFE 23/93. Paragraph (a) of the present Determination, however, does not mention the earlier Determination and, therefore, does not appear to effect its apparent legislative intent.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mal</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 24 February 1994 to Mr Crean in which you requested information relating to Determination No. TAFE 45/93 made under the provisions of the States Grants (TAFE Assistance) Act 1989. Given the responsibilities of my portfolio Mr Crean has referred this matter to me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you pointed out in your letter the purpose of the Determination was to revoke a previous Determination No. TAFE 23/93 but because of a processing error the "23/93" did not print.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice was sought from Attorney-General's Department as to whether the revocation of Determination No. TAFE 23/93 was effective. They advised that "when reading 45/93 as a whole, 45/93 has effectively revoked 23/93. A comparison of 45/93 with 23/93 also supports this view".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They went on to say, "there were a number of determinations in existence under subsections 12(1), 13(1) and 14(1) of the Act at the time 45/93 was made. However, only 45/93 and 23/93 deal with proposals for expenditure on general equipment. Both determinations deal with expenditure in the same States. In some cases, the amount authorised for the expenditure of a State is the same in 45/93 and 23/93. In the other cases, the amount authorised for a State in 45/93 is higher than the amount authorised for the State in 23/93. 45/93 was made after 23/93. It appears that the purpose of 45/93 was to raise some of the amounts authorised for certain States. It is clear from these facts that 45/93 was intended to revoke 23/93. This reading of 45/93 is confirmed by the Explanatory Statement, which states that 45/93 revokes 23/93. Paragraph 15AB(1)(a) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 permits the reference to extrinsic material, such as an Explanatory Statement, to resolve the meaning of a determination which is otherwise obscure".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this answers your concerns.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, that is a matter of which I have not even been given notice. I am concerned that individual senators have the opportunity of raising particular matters before estimates committees. We all have that responsibility on behalf of our constituents. It becomes increasingly difficult to ensure that proper audit and control of government expenditure are undertaken if these committees are meeting at the same time. I understand that A, B and C are meeting at the same time, and that D, E and F are meeting at the same time; they have done that for some years now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we have a proposition to add F to A, B and C. An individual senator would need the gift of not bi-location or tri-location but, I suppose, quattro-location, and that is impossible. If this motion is to be accepted by the Senate, I would hope that the chairs of the various committees&mdash;and this is what I would have said, had I been advised of this&mdash;will postpone particular items so that individual senators may, when they are free from other commitments in the estimates committee, raise matters as to where expenditure is going. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to apologise to Senator Harradine. I had asked the secretary of Estimates Committee F to contact him this morning to explain the circumstances surrounding this matter. Apparently there was either insufficient time or the secretary could not contact Senator Harradine for some reason. There was no discourtesy meant towards Senator Harradine. In fact, I specifically asked that he be advised. I also asked that the Australian Democrats and the Greens be advised. I hope that they were. I asked the secretary to talk to Senator Reid this morning about the matter, as she is the whip for the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances are that Estimates Committee F is meeting on Thursday and Friday. After having a look at the times for which the minister and you, Mr President, are available for the estimates for the parliament, it seemed to me that there was insufficient time to be able to deal with the matters in Estimates Committee F in those two days. I then faced the possibility of working very late into Friday night, which would not be particularly acceptable to most senators, or delaying some of the estimates to the following week when we were all back in parliament anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I explored the possibility of working partly on Wednesday. The intention is to start at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon and then work through into the evening. I checked with senators&mdash;particularly Senator Tambling, and I think there was one other senator as well&mdash;on Estimates Committee F who have particular interests in Wednesday afternoon's program, namely, housing and regional development. I did that because those senators have interests in another committee which is sitting on that day. It was acceptable to them and to the minister to come on the day before, starting at three o'clock. I thought that, as far as possible, we covered all bases so that those senators who were interested would be able to attend and would not miss any of the other departments appearing before other committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also spoke to Senator Reynolds, who is chairing Estimates Committee C. She is exploring the possibility of scheduling departmental appearances, so there is less likelihood of the two committees clashing. Again, I do not like having four estimates committees meeting at once. However, it does give senators a better opportunity to pursue their matters of interest. The committee will not be meeting until three o'clock in the afternoon, by which time senators on other committees who wish to attend F for this particular department will have completed their business on those other committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;Some of the concerns raised by Senator Harradine have been answered and responded to by Senator Colston. Senator Harradine made a reasonable point. Clearly we can approach this by ensuring that items of interest are staggered if Estimates Committee F meets at the same time as committees A, B and C. I will ask estimates committee chairs to be sensitive to that. I think we can also coordinate that with the secretaries of those estimates committees so that any conflicting times of matters before estimates committees are managed to give Senator Harradine and all other senators an opportunity to make a contribution before estimates committees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">FINANCIAL AGREEMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The signing of the new <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Agreement Between the Commonwealth, States and Territories</EMPHASIS> by the Prime Minister, the Premiers, and Chief Ministers at the meeting of the Council of Australian Governments on 25 February 1994 was an important step in the continuing evolution of the Commonwealth's financial relationship with the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill approves the new Financial Agreement which provides for the continued existence of a Loan Council with broadly specified role and powers, sets out certain obligations in respect of past Financial Agreement borrowings, and provides for formal membership of Loan Council for the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The original <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Agreement Between the Commonwealth and the States</EMPHASIS> was made in 1927 and approved under the Commonwealth's Financial Agreement Act 1928 and by the Parliament of each State. The Agreement established the Loan Council and required the Commonwealth and each State to submit an annual borrowing program for Loan Council approval. The Agreement was last amended in 1976 and many of its provisions are now obsolete. In particular, Loan Council scrutiny of public sector borrowings has for many years taken place under voluntarily agreed arrangements rather than the provisions of the Agreement. On this occasion it is proposed that the existing Agreement, as varied since 1927, be rescinded, as provided for under the constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill, which is being introduced along with the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994, establishes a new fund, the Debt Retirement Reserve Trust Account, through which the redemption of Commonwealth Government securities on issue on behalf of the States and the Northern Territory will be administered. This will replace arrangements through the National Debt Sinking Fund for the States and through the Northern Territory Debt Sinking Fund for the Northern Territory. The removal of the States from the ambit of the National Debt Sinking Fund will facilitate the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966 and the establishment of a more efficient debt redemption framework for the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Agreement would remove the requirement for future Commonwealth and State borrowings to be approved under the provisions of the Agreement. This would reflect the reality that for many years only the Commonwealth's annual borrowing program has been formally approved under the Financial Agreement because only the Commonwealth undertakes budget sector borrowings directly rather than through a central borrowing authority outside the Agreement. From 1993-94, Commonwealth, State and territory borrowings have been subject to Loan Council monitoring under the new deficit based arrangements agreed by Loan Council at its  meetings in December 1992 and July 1993. These new arrangements, which superseded the global approach resolution, reflect the common interest of the Commonwealth and States in ensuring that overall public sector borrowing in Australia is consistent with sound macroeconomic policy and that borrowings by each government are consistent with a sustainable fiscal strategy. The emphasis in the new arrangements is on credible budgetary processes, ensuring a high level of public understanding of public sector financing, and facilitating increased financial market scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Agreement would also remove the Commonwealth's explicit power to borrow on behalf of the States. Reflecting the States' own borrowing activities outside the provisions of the Agreement, the Commonwealth has undertaken no new money borrowings on behalf of the States since 1987-88. Loan Council decided in 1990 that the States would progressively take over responsibility for debt previously issued on their behalf under the Financial Agreement. These arrangements place full responsibility on the States for financing and managing their own debt, thus subjecting their fiscal and debt management strategies to greater community and financial market scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the new Agreement would abolish the restriction on States borrowing by the issue of securities in their own names in domestic and overseas markets. This would again recognise that the States conduct extensive borrowing activities through their central borrowing authorities outside the provisions of the Agreement. These borrowings are regarded by the financial markets effectively as sovereign issues and rated accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted, the proposed Agreement was signed by all Heads of Government at the Council of Australian Governments meeting on Friday 25 February 1994. To become effective, the Agreement requires the passage of complementary legislation in the Commonwealth and all State and Territory Parliaments. That will inevitably take a little time but the Treasurer has asked his State and Territory counterparts to press ahead with their legislation so that the new Agreement can be brought into effect&mdash;in particular, so that the Territories can take their rightful place as full members of Loan Council&mdash;with a minimum of delay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Report of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council</EMPHASIS> was recently tabled, calling, inter alia, for further redrafting of the Financial Agreement to reflect the Committee's recommendations for:  increased accountability of Loan Council to Parliaments, including through an expanded role for Auditors-General;  for the adoption of accrual accounting; and for legislative backing to be given to the new Loan Council reporting arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill does not deal with all of the recommendations in the Senate Committee's report. On the other hand, it does not pre-empt the Committee's proposals on the issues that are not included. The Government is considering the Committee's final report, including its proposals in relation to the Financial Agreement, and will provide the Committee with a response to its recommendations. However, consultations with the States and Territories at official level have indicated that there would not be a consensus in favour of the recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Agreement has already been agreed by Premiers and Chief Ministers. Of course, any amendments to the Agreement by the Commonwealth Parliament would also need to be incorporated in complementary State and Territory legislation before they could become effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate and table the associated explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">NATIONAL DEBT SINKING FUND REPEAL BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to effect the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, thereby abolishing the National Debt Sinking Fund and its controlling body, the National Debt Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is being introduced along with a bill to amend the Financial Agreement Act, to formalise changed borrowing and debt redemption arrangements agreed between the Commonwealth, the States and the Territories following decisions at the June 1990 meeting of the Loan Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the past, the Commonwealth has been inhibited from rationalising the debt redemption arrangements through the Fund because of the necessary pre-condition for coordinated action by the Commonwealth and each of the States to amend the Financial Agreement. With the changes now proposed to the Financial Agreement Act, the opportunity is being taken to proceed with the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission was originally constituted by the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1923 which also established the National Debt Sinking Fund for the redemption of Commonwealth debt and placed the Fund under the Commission's control. The Financial Agreement of 1927 provided that sinking funds established in respect of the States' debts were placed under the control of the Commission. The National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, which replaced the 1923 Act, changed the sources of income to the Fund and the assessment of contributions to the Fund payable from the Consolidated Revenue Fund of the Commonwealth. Variations to the Financial Agreement of 1976 provided for the absorption of the States' Sinking Funds into the National Debt Sinking Fund, with separate accounts being maintained for the Commonwealth and each State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the terms of the current Financial Agreement, the States have been required to contribute to their sinking fund accounts at a rate sufficient to redeem only a very small portion of maturing debt each year, the debt being mostly rolled over into new raisings by the Commonwealth on the States' behalf. However, following the June 1990 meeting of the Loan Council, the States have made sufficient contributions into the Fund to redeem in full their maturing debt each year. The amendments to the Financial Agreement encompass amongst other things a formalisation of that basis of contribution and establish a new Trust Fund, the Debt Retirement Reserve Trust Account, to handle the redemption of Commonwealth Government securities on issue to the States and the Northern Territory. The separate Northern Territory Debt Sinking Fund established under the Audit Act 1901, through which debt redemption has proceeded on an identical basis to that for the States, would cease to operate from the date of establishment of the Debt Retirement Reserve Trust Account. The final series of Commonwealth  Government securities on issue for the States and the Territories will mature in 2005-06, bringing to an end the debt redemption arrangements through the Debt Retirement Reserve Trust Account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With the removal of the States from the ambit of the National Debt Sinking Fund, the Fund is rendered a purely Commonwealth Fund, the separate existence of which is no longer necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the Commonwealth, the Fund was designed originally to provide investors with confidence that their investment was secure with the Government paying money into a fund to meet the eventual redemption, or in the case of certain issues floated overseas, to redeem the debt progressively over a specified time span. The Commonwealth's reputation in capital markets has, of course, subsequently become well established, rendering the Fund redundant also in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, in practice, the transactions of the Fund on behalf of the Commonwealth are integrated into the Commonwealth's overall debt management activities and the allocation of particular debt redemption transactions to the Fund is essentially an accounting matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Against this background, the role of the Commission has become vestigial. The sole activity of this body, chaired by the Treasurer and with, as other Commissioners, the Secretary to the Treasury, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department and a representative of the States, is to meet briefly once each year to formally authorise the program of transactions of the Fund for the current financial year and to approve its annual report for the past financial year. Secretariat services are provided to the Commission by the Commonwealth Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued existence of the Fund would perpetuate an unduly complicated accounting and administrative structure for only a portion of the Commonwealth's debt redemption activities. In years of significant budget surplus, such as in the late 1980s, the annual redemption of the Commonwealth's debt is greater through other accounts within the Commonwealth Public Account, such as the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve, than through the Fund. In years of budget deficit, redemptions of the Commonwealth's debt through the Fund are met under an appropriation from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, but in effect they are financed by borrowing and the debt is therefore rolled over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, while debt redemption processes through the National Debt Sinking Fund have been by way of reimbursement by the Fund of payments made on its behalf to holders of debt, the Fund has also been required to maintain balances as if it was paying debt holders directly. This has been of significance given the standing of the Fund as separate from other elements of the Trust Fund within the Commonwealth Public Account. As a consequence, there has been the potential for higher debt issuance and Public Debt Interest costs than those which would have been necessary with non-separation of the National Debt Sinking Fund. An offset to this increase has been provided by resultant higher interest earnings on the Commonwealth's cash balances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the repeal of the National Debt Sinking Fund Act 1966, a more streamlined debt redemption framework would be established. Redemptions on behalf of the Commonwealth would be met through the Consolidated Revenue Fund, the Loan Fund and the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve under existing standing appropriation provisions and legislative authorities. These funds are already used for redemptions which are unable to be funded through the resources of the Sinking Fund. Under these arrangements, a comprehensive reporting of the financial year's debt redemption activity would continue in order to maintain public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to the Senate and table the associated explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SOCIAL SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill gives legislative effect to several measures announced in the context of the 1993 Budget and to a number of other changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some people with disabilities are unable to find jobs in the open labour market because their disability prevents them from being able to do the job to the level expected of people without disabilities. Under the existing award wage system they have to be paid full award rates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As announced in the 1993 Budget, a new payment type, disability wage supplement, will be introduced from 1 July 1994. The supplement will be based on the qualification and payability conditions for disability support pension and will be available each year for up to 1,000 people who enter the `supported wage system' administered by the Department of Human Services and Health. The supported wage system aims at assisting persons with a disability to enter the workforce and will provide that the person may be paid less than the award wage based on his or her productivity compared to a person in the same occupation who does not have such a disability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Disability wage supplement will be available at the same rates applicable to disability support pensioners and will be subject to similar rules, including the income and assets tests. As a result, income earned under the supported wage system by a disability wage supplement client will count as income for the purposes of determining a rate of disability wage supplement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the 1993 Budget process, the Government agreed that from 1 January 1995, the maximum rate of additional family payment payable in respect of children who have not turned 16 should be increased by $1 a week per child. This bill gives effect to that agreement. Approximately 800,000 low income families will benefit from this measure at an estimated cost of $45.0m in 1994-95 and $46.0m in 1995-96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To qualify for age pension, a woman currently must be 60 and a man 65. This bill provides for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991 to increase the pension age for women from 60 to 65. As announced in the 1993 Budget, the increase is to be phased in over a 20 year period, starting on 1 July 1995, in recognition of any remaining labour force disadvantages incurred over the years by the older women affected by the proposal. By 1 July 2013, the women's age pension age will be 65 following pension age increases of six months every 2 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As mentioned previously, this bill gives effect to a number of non-Budgetary measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the Social Security Act 1991 will be amended so as to impose a cap of 50% on the rate of return for shares and managed investments for ordinary income assessment purposes. It will also be amended so as to provide that the rate of return of a managed investment or listed security, that has not been available for the whole of a 12 months assessment period, is to be calculated on the basis of the performance of the product to date without extrapolating that performance over the 12 month period. These are beneficial measures for social security clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, as a result of amendments made by the Migration Reform Act 1992 to the Migration Act 1958, major consequential changes will be made to the Migration Regulations by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, to take effect on 1 September 1994. In turn, there is a need for amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991 to allow the Minister for Social Security to take account of these changes by way of disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a general sense, these amendments will ensure that relevant provisions in the Social Security Act will either refer to visas specified in the Migration Act or, if this is not possible, allow the Minister to amend references to the Migration Regulations by way of disallowable instrument.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third set of minor amendments are to overcome an unexpected loophole in the Social Security Act 1991 that has arisen as a result of a recent decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The Social Security Act has always required that, for most social security payments to be payable, the recipient must provide his or her tax file number to the Department if requested to do so by the Secretary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993 the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in Re Malloch and Secretary, Department of Social Security held that the Principal Act does not prevent payment to a person who refuses to provide a tax file number to the Department on the basis that they do not have a tax file number and have no intention of getting one.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments in respect of all relevant payment types are included in this bill with a view to preventing payment in the situation that arose on Malloch's case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill provides for several minor amendments to be made to the Social Security Act 1991, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and the Farm Household Support Act 1992 that are consequential upon the introduction of the new home child care and partner allowances by the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill re-introduces the amendments proposed in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No.3) 1993 with the exception of Part 7. Part 7 of that bill dealt with amendments to the managed investments legislation. The 1993 bill was laid aside by the House of Representatives on 24 February 1994 following disagreement between the Houses about the inclusion of Part 7. Aside from renumbering to take account of this omission, the remainder of the 1993 bill has been duplicated in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposed the amendments to the managed investment legislation as they are beneficial to service pensioners with this form of investment. There are not `winners and losers' as the Opposition tried to argue during the debate on the 1993 bill. There are only winners. In fact, this is reflected in the commencement date of the proposed changes which was to ensure that the amendments retrospectively commence from 1 April 1993. However, in weighing up the totality of the bill, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs feels that there would be a greater injustice in not passing the bill at all; in particular, the 10,000 veterans and their dependants who would not be able to get the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card from the Department of Veterans' Affairs from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now turn to the measures in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Building On Strength, the Government announced as part of its advancement towards a fairer Australia that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test and by introducing a Commonwealth seniors health card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government fulfilled the first part of this commitment by introducing legislation to ease the pensions assets test from 20 September 1993. This bill meets the second part of that commitment by introducing a Commonwealth seniors health card from 1 July 1994. This card will give certain low income non-service pensioners access to concessional pharmaceutical benefits, hearing aid concessions and optometry services. It is estimated that this proposal will assist a total of 10,000 veterans and dependants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also befitting in the Year of the Family that the Government proposes a bill containing amendments to the child related payments legislation. These amendments introduce greater flexibility in the delivery of child related payments recognising the important role of the primary care giver and the financial burden placed on them. This initiative is part of the Government's on-going commitment to families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main features of this initiative are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the ability to redirect child related payments to the partner;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">adjusting the pension payment in shared care cases so that the child related payments are also shared;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">backdating child related payments to the first payday after the date of birth in those cases where notification is received within thirteen weeks of the birth; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring, where pensioners have children and are receiving maintenance income, the maintenance income only affects the child related payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes result in a more equitable method for assessing child related payments and flow from the family payments structure under the Social Security Act 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides consistency in the arrangements for offsetting compensation payments against disability pension for the same incapacity or death for which compensation is paid. At present, this provision applies only to disability pensions paid under Part IV of the Veterans' Entitlements Act in respect of defence or certain peacekeeping service. The amendment ensures that the offsetting arrangements will also apply to disability pension paid under Part II in respect of war or operational service. This provision will apply only to payments of compensation made after the date of Royal Assent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also clarifies the operation of the tax file number provisions where a person fails to comply with a request for a tax file number. In such instances, the Veterans' Entitlements Act currently directs that the person's pension or allowance is not to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments set out the effect of failing to comply with a request for a tax file number and introduce a generous reconsideration period. It is proposed to give the person three months from the date the pension was last paid to comply with the request for a tax file number and still receive full restitution of the cancelled payment. This would allow the person time to consider the consequences of failing to provide the tax file number. If, however, a person complies with the request after the expiration of the three month period, the pension or allowance will then be restored from the payday after compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This three month period is in addition to the 28 days that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs already allows the person to comply with the request before action is taken to stop the pension payment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment puts beyond doubt the intention of the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, this initiative will apply only to pensioners required by the Secretary to provide a tax file number. If the individual or a pensioner category has been exempted from providing a tax file number, these amendments will not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another initiative simplifies the current arrangements for withdrawing an application to determine qualifying service or a claim for service pension. It allows for a person to orally withdraw an application or a claim and to reactivate that application or claim, within 28 days of its withdrawal, without penalty to the original one. This initiative is consistent with the aim of assisting pensioners in their dealings with the Department by encouraging oral communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further amendment will be made to the definition of `income' to exempt from that definition payments received from the New South Wales Medically-Acquired HIV Trust. This follows a similar amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act in 1992 which exempted payments received from the Mark Fitzpatrick Trust.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, this bill will make a number of minor changes in the area of service pension assessment including a series of technical and consequential amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">EMPLOYMENT, EDUCATION AND TRAINING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make minor amendments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Maritime College Act 1978, and to repeal other Acts relating to employment, education and training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 provides minor adjustments to financial amounts. These adjustments flow from the transfer of responsibilities for funding the Institute of the Arts of the Australian National University from the ACT Government to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ACT Government receives special revenue assistance as part of general revenue payments from the Commonwealth. The level of special revenue assistance has in the past made allowance (as assessed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission) for the cost of funding the Institute of the Arts so as to maintain the same level of courses as existed at the time of self-government. In accordance with the Commonwealth Grants Commission's 1992 Update of relativities, the Commonwealth will provide the funding directly to the Australian National University through the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 with a consequential reduction in special revenue assistance to the ACT Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Additional funding adjustments are required as a result of Senate amendments to the Higher Education Funding Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 which removed the provisions for a double rate of the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS) on undergraduate students undertaking a second degree at the same or lower level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of the financial adjustments to the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 relating to the transfer of funding for the Institute of the Arts and the removal of double HECS, this bill will provide an additional $26.1 million in 1994, $31 million in 1995 and $30.2 million in 1996. The increase in outlays will be partly offset by a reduction in payments from the Higher Education Contribution Scheme Trust Account of $20.9 million in 1994, $20.5 million in 1995 and $18.9 million in 1996. In the longer term, Commonwealth outlays will increase by approximately $27 million each year due to the removal of the double HECS provisions. In addition, a reduction in general revenue payments to the ACT Government of $3.3 million in 1995 and 1996 will be made to fully offset the payments for the Institute of the Arts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is usually convenient to include all the amendments affecting payments under the Higher Education Funding Act in a Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill implementing Budget or additional estimates decisions about higher education funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the current amendment affects amounts to be paid in calendar year 1994 and it is therefore desirable that the revised amounts be legislated as soon as practicable. This bill is the first available vehicle on the legislation program for this portfolio which can contain the amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Attorney-General's Department has advised that there is no Constitutional or other legal impediment to including the  amendment to the Higher Education Funding Act in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's provisions also include amendments to the Maritime College Act 1978. These amendments include appointing the Chairperson of the Academic Board as an ex officio member of the Australian Maritime College Council. This will give appropriate representation on the Council to senior teaching staff and leave one member of the Council to be elected by the whole of the College's teaching staff.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the Maritime College Act include changes to gender specific references in order to reflect current drafting practices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will also repeal three Acts relating to employment, education and training. These Acts have been superseded and are no longer required.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is part of the package of legislation to implement the 1993-94 budget decision to impose a charge on industry to support the continental margins program conducted by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation (AGSO).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review's report contained a wide range of recommendations which have been carefully considered by the government. The continental margins program was identified by the review as essential.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objectives of the continental margins program are to provide geoscientific information and advice in order to improve offshore petroleum and mineral exploration efficiency and effectiveness. The program also supports government decision making on offshore petroleum and mineral exploration and development. Other objectives of the program are to sustain Australia's legal continental shelf claim and to support inter-governmental negotiations on the delineation of sea-bed boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Richards Review argued that geoscientific work undertaken by AGSO through the continental margins program should be fully funded by government. The government's view is that where there are community benefits, the community should pay. Where the industry benefits, the industry should pay. Where benefits are shared, costs should be shared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision to raise approximately $10 million from the offshore exploration industry to fund about half the cost of the continental margin program, commencing in 1994-95, is based on the principle that the program benefits both the industry and the community. Therefore, both should contribute to its funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The data and ideas flowing from the program have been of benefit to companies in their exploration programs. The charge will be applied to exploration permits and retention leases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To date the continental margins program has focused on activities related to petroleum. Hence the charge will initially be levied only on the petroleum industry. Based on the current number of permits and leases, a charge of around $100,000 per title will be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the program, after consultation with industry, be extended to research of interest to the minerals industry, a charge will be applied to minerals exploration and retention licences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is committed to ensuring that the work of AGSO, including this program, remains relevant to both industry and community needs. AGSO has thus been directed to consult fully with the industry in the development of, and reporting on, its programs. This will enable industry priorities to be taken into account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The program will be subject of evaluation in 1996-97. This bill will also make a number of miscellaneous amendments to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 to improve efficiency in administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also repeal four acts which provide for the charging of fees to cover costs of administering offshore petroleum titles. A separate bill will create a consolidated fees act to replace these four acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr speaker, I will now briefly refer to these miscellaneous amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that the outer territorial sea boundary adjacent to Western Australia and the Northern Territory will remain at three nautical miles for the purposes of this act. This amendment rectifies an inconsistency created when the Australia-Indonesia zone of cooperation in the Timor gap was excised from the act in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is being made to ensure that joint delegations of routine joint authority powers to officials can be made to nominated positions rather than named persons. This amendment will avoid the need to issue a revised delegation instrument each time a different person holds a nominated position. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will remove the need for the designated authority to consult titleholders affected by an access authority application where the applicant has obtained prior written agreement from relevant titleholders to the access authority. This amendment will streamline procedures for access authorities without affecting the rights of other parties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also clarifies that the companies rather than the regulatory authorities should accept ultimate liability for their operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This decision will encourage companies to use their management skills to ensure that safety and environmental objectives are effectively met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will repeal the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Pipeline Licence Fees) Act 1967, and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Retention Lease Fees) Act 1985. This will allow the consolidation of these acts into a single fees act. This proposed act forms the basis of a separate bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments allowing the appropriation of charges to partly fund the continental margins program, have a financial impact. They will allow the $10 million expected to be raised each financial year, commencing in 1994-95, to be allocated to this program. None of the other amendments have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the honourable senators, and present the  explanatory memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PETROLEUM (SUBMERGED LANDS) FEES BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is part of the package of offshore petroleum and minerals bills. This bill will establish the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Fees Act 1994 (The Fees Act).  This act will replace and consolidate the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Exploration Permit Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Act 1967, the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Pipeline Licence Fees) Act 1967, and the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Retention Lease Fees) Act 1985.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consolidation of these four acts into a single fees act will reduce the quantity of legislation administering the offshore petroleum industry. The provisions of the fees act are equivalent to those of the four acts it replaces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to a single fees act will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of this motion is to set in train parliament's formal consideration of the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill. I do not intend to go through in detail the provisions of this bill. The bill has been tabled and I have provided it to members who have indicated to me an interest in the issue. In essence, it provides an avenue for the courts to decide between a parliament's demand for information and a government's refusal to provide that information on public interest grounds. The motion is long and it is self-explanatory. As it says, recent history shows that there is no satisfactory way of having a respected and impartial body&mdash;namely, a superior court&mdash;rule on a public interest immunity claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Australian Democrats' view, this bill fills that vacuum. I do not claim it is perfect, and I am very happy for others to have input to the sorts of improvements that might be made to it. It was in fact the government which suggested that the most appropriate starting point for dealing with the bill was to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges. The Democrats believe that is an appropriate procedure and, as I understand it, the opposition has indicated its agreement. Accordingly, the motion establishes an inquiry by the privileges committee and sets a reporting date of 23 August. Although the bill is not long or extremely complicated, I think it raises important questions requiring a reasonable period of deliberation. The terms of reference require the committee to give particular attention to the bill's effectiveness in providing a solution to the fairly frequent impasses reached by the Senate and the government over the supply of information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has also suggested that the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges should consider holding an inquiry into this bill. That of course is a matter for the House of Representatives, but such a move could assist in the evaluation of the legislation. The motion also proposes that, because the Democrats introduced the bill and need to monitor its evaluation, we should have a place on the privileges committee. But it is a non-voting place and it is simply for the purposes of this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I do not know the exact terms of the amendment that I understand is to be moved by Senator Loosley, I expect government members see that the sting of this motion is in its tail. The last part of the motion proposes that the Senate Select Committee into Print Media and Foreign Ownership Decisions make a substantial interim report on the scheduled date of 9 June but that its final report be delayed until 22 September. I can imagine the obvious objections&mdash;such as cost, and what will happen to the committee in the meantime. I have made arrangements for that to be taken on board, and the committee would operate with a skeleton staff, if that is an appropriate description of the likes of Richard Gilbert. This skeleton staff arrangement would avoid any suggestion that an entire committee secretariat has been left to twiddle its thumbs between 9 June and 22 September. This arrangement is very inexpensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of this extension is to make it absolutely clear that the Senate is determined to test the government's claim that to expose the machinations of the Foreign Investment Review Board is somehow contrary to the public interest. Based on evidence we have heard before the committee, the government is well aware that its public interest immunity claim is built on a shaky legal foundation. Yet we have seen the continual thumbing of nose at accountability by withholding vital FIRB documents, including one which had been leaked and which the Treasurer has since released, with the addition of the one sentence that was missing from the document that members of the committee had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More crucial to our deliberations is the consideration that senior public servants have deliberately added an extra layer to this lack of accountability by claiming to have forgotten crucial events in the lead-up to the Fairfax sale. Having watched their body language carefully, having gone back and looked at their language very carefully, having assessed their evidence, I find their amnesia particularly selective. Quite a few prominent figures seem to be suffering from that sort of amnesia under oath these days. I think this chamber should do all within its power to reverse that trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government amendment is a continuation of an unsuccessful campaign to prevent the inquiry from getting to the truth of this matter. Labor senators who give some thought to this matter&mdash;and only Senator Murphy stayed at the committee meeting yesterday to listen to the arguments; some people who are going to speak on this matter were not even there to hear me canvass why I thought this was necessary&mdash;will realise why it is absolutely logical to link the bill and the committee's final report, because the catalyst for my introducing this bill was the government's public interest immunity claim over FIRB documents. I was not sitting at home one Sunday afternoon, musing to myself on the deficiencies of a particular clause in the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It was the behaviour of witnesses before our committee and the instructions of the Treasurer to those witnesses that prompted me to take some action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government's amendment tells me is that the government does not believe its own rhetoric, because if it is really convinced that to release the documents would not be in the public interest, it stands to gain a great deal from this motion and this bill. A Federal Court decision not to disclose the FIRB documents would be a big victory for executive privilege, but it is not willing to test that. This amendment suggests that the government's public interest arguments are just an excuse for a cover-up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of this motion lies in the fact that it begins formal consideration of one of the most important accountability measures to be put before this chamber. More particularly, I commend the motion to the Senate not just because of its immediate significance but because it is constructive, sensible and even cost effective to sort out for the long term the relative powers of the executive, the Senate and public servants with respect to public interest immunity. Despite the ritualised huffing and puffing of Labor senators on the committee, it is my understanding that the government does wish to pursue a more appropriate resolution of the issue. The objections we are about to hear are for the usual political reasons and they cannot be sustained on the principle of the need to resolve the tension when parliaments demand and have a right to information and a government refuses to provide that information on public interest grounds. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

When I twice asked him in the chair whether I had the opportunity to put a point of view, whether I had the call without being abused, his response was, I believe, `I am under no obligation to answer that question.'

It does not seem to me to be an unreasonable proposal, although I note that the opposition proposes to take control of the privileges committee under its revamped committee system; and there is a certain danger in that.

I said that clearly at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is no agreement to extending this body for a third or fourth time, a body which should have reported, according to the original proposition, by 28 February.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important amendment, particularly because it recognises what the government fails to recognise, namely, that very important policy issues are at stake. It is probably some embarrassment that Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, for several years sat on a committee that gave very careful consideration to how the forms of the Senate ought to operate, what rules ought to apply, the conduct of committees, and what ultimate sanctions ought to be in place to ensure that the Senate was able to properly go about its business. It was only after a long and detailed inquiry and report that we ultimately had the rules that govern the operation of this committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, those rules allow for witnesses who do not cooperate to be dealt with. If those rules did not allow for that, then witnesses could ignore a committee with impunity; whereas we know that the intention of the founding fathers was that not just both houses of parliament should be supreme but that the Senate, quite deliberately, was given powers that are given to virtually no other upper house in the Western world. Therefore, it was important to ensure that those powers were properly exercised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is against that background, therefore, that this committee was given absolute powers to require witnesses to give evidence, to compel the production of documents and, by extension, to deal with persons who failed to cooperate or who did not produce documents when requested. Against that express term of reference, there is of course the concept of public interest immunity, which has grown up over the years in an endeavour by the courts to control the otherwise untrammelled exercise of power by the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The courts took the view that it was not sufficient for the executive to say, `We will not cooperate. We will not produce documents. We will not give evidence.' The courts said, `There may be circumstances in which that can be the case, but where we are concerned with statutory powers, we will make judgments on those matters and we will decide whether public interest immunity applies.' As for the advice available to this committee, particularly from Mr David Jackson QC, it is absolutely clear that this Senate has unqualified powers to require witnesses to give evidence and to produce documents. The government has had abundant opportunities to provide contrary legal advice to this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have heard Senator Murphy say on several occasions that he disagrees with Mr Jackson&mdash;he does not pretend to be on the same plane as Mr Jackson but, in his humble view, he disagrees. I do not have a problem with Senator Murphy disagreeing with Mr Jackson but I do have a problem with a Treasurer, with the vast resources of the government at his disposal, not bothering to put before the committee any contrary legal view, despite the fact that at one stage I read in the press that the government was in possession of advice that cast doubt on those powers. We have never seen it; we have never heard of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of the members of the committee on the other side of this chamber have ever attempted to address our attention to any legal authority or legal advice that might indicate that somehow the powers of the Senate are limited. The witnesses, Messrs Hinton and Pooley, who effectively claimed that they were precluded by a direction from the Treasurer from cooperating with the committee, even though they were given every opportunity to take legal advice, at no stage sought to produce any advice, or direct our attention to any authorities in any shape or form to argue their case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have is simply the government thumbing its nose at a Senate committee which has very clear powers to require cooperation. It is against that background that Senator Kernot's motion has been moved. This will have the effect of allowing, not just in relation to this committee but also in relation to future committees and future situations where impasses can arise, a third party, untrammelled by the political pressures that might sometimes apply in committees, to make an independent judgment. It certainly should not be assumed that that independent tribunal would come down on one side or another. It would make judgments on the merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that Senator Loosley, without notice, should move such a decoupling amendment because it is perfectly clear to all concerned that he does not have the courage of his convictions&mdash;and I will come to his convictions a little later, because he has quite a number in politics. The fact is that those opposite are simply anxious or determined by all means to try to cut this concept&mdash;this perfectly proper alternative proposal&mdash;adrift from this committee's deliberations so that the government can simply have its way, ignore any findings, simply not hand over the documents and then say that the committee was unsuccessful in getting to the heart of the matter. There is only one person who qualifies for the title of national disgrace around this place, I would have thought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this committee has been remarkably successful to date because not only have we had evidence from a number of important witnesses, but when it comes to the question of balanced coverage, for example, we have not yet had the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) contradict what he said on the record in Seattle about a commitment with Conrad Black and having delivered on that commitment after the election. So we have the evidence starkly on the record to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When it comes to the effectiveness of the Foreign Investment Review Board, we had the very person who is now pretending that this committee has achieved absolutely nothing and who preferred to swan off to PNG, saying on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS> a couple of weeks back that he and his Senate colleagues had taken the view that something had to be done about ensuring there was more transparency in the process. No doubt that is what led poor old Ralph Willis to have to finally stop defending the indefensible and tell Mike Steketee of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> that indeed he had always thought that there was a problem with the Foreign Investment Review Board process&mdash;he had known that from the moment he became Treasurer&mdash;and that after our committee has reported, he will certainly be looking at amendments that would require the Treasurer to provide reasons for foreign investment decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that that is a dramatic breakthrough and an achievement that directly derives from the work of this committee. But, no. With a straight face, the person who spoke before me had the gall to say in the committee yesterday that the fact was that this committee had been totally discredited. When challenged to concede that that was simply his view of the world and not shared by others, he would not for a moment resile from that proposition. Then, when challenged with the fact that indeed he and Mr Willis had both conceded the FIRB point and were proposing amendments, he said with a straight face that that had nothing to do with this committee. </PARA>

Honourable senators will recall that Senator Loosley was taken to task some weeks ago because the article he manages to churn out each week&mdash;we do not know how much he gets paid for it or where the proceeds go&mdash;had `Senator Loosley, ALP Senator'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Senator Loosley and his colleagues&mdash;certainly Senator Carr&mdash;are absolutely desperate to try to discredit this committee, to derail it by all possible means, to have ritual interruptions and disruptions, to have the most extraordinary leaking of all that has ever gone on. For that person then to say that one of the problems is that we did not strive for consensus really beggars belief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At no stage has Senator Loosley sought to achieve any form of consensus. We have had these childish tactics and responses. One thing that really concerns me about the whole way in which this committee has conducted its deliberations&mdash;as senators will recall&mdash;is an occasion when Senator Loosley alleged a conflict of interest because I had made a phone call to Allan Kohler. It subsequently emerged that he himself had discussions with two of the witnesses before they gave evidence to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That matter was written up in a number of national newspapers. When asked to comment further as a result of those articles, Senator Loosley responded by refusing to take phone calls&mdash;in other words, the same silly, childish immaturity, the same sulking approach that he took yesterday and that no doubt he always takes as a deliberate tactic. I should have thought that it was a matter of great concern to this chamber that those allegations were first raised as a result of phone calls received by me and, I believe, several others from deep inside the Fairfax organisation indicating that Senator Loosley had briefed witnesses beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know the fact of that matter, but it was certainly put forward that Senator Loosley had done at least the very thing he was accusing others of doing and that that required an explanation. Several of the persons, Mr Cockburn and Mr Hickie, made statements to the newspapers endeavouring to play down the significance of the matter. Then we had Senator Loosley reported in the media as saying:</PARA>

Do senators really believe these vague statements about `just happening to bump into Mr Hickie', `they were really talking about the Ros Kelly affair', and Senator Loosley saying he did not believe anything specific was discussed about the inquiry, although it could have come up? Can we really believe that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background I should have thought the first thing that Senator Loosley would have wanted to do when this issue was raised by way of a question from Senator Ellison several months back to Senator Gareth Evans, was to get to his feet and explain the full circumstances in which he came to talk to Messrs Hickie and Cockburn; but he did no such thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley did not even have the courage to canvass that issue in the chamber. He has remained silent, other than for what, I would have thought, on their face, were those incredible explanations. I hope that he will come back into the chamber and fully explain these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee has taken evidence from a number of important witnesses. It has been able to proceed to a considerable extent to ascertain matters. We have had a very significant concession from the Treasurer when he finally confirmed the identity of the leaked FIRB minute. That minute would never have seen the light of day if it had not been for this committee and if it had not been initially contained in a submission. Despite all the efforts of the witnesses from Treasury who refused to comment on it as a result of directions from the Treasurer, the fact is that public opinion went so much against the Treasurer on that matter that he ultimately wrote the committee a letter conceding that that was indeed a true copy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, of course, opens up a whole lot of other issues&mdash;particularly, how it came to be that the minute contained what others have said are very inaccurate and false statements about the quality of the AIN bid. It is very important, therefore, for the committee to be able to further question public servants about those matters and, particularly, to get to the bottom of why it was that Dr Roberts, the day after FIRB had made its recommendation to the Treasurer on 5 December, should ring Baring Brothers Burrows out of the blue and ask for basic background information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, one would have thought that that is demanding of an explanation. It is verging on the incredible to think that Dr Roberts cannot recall the circumstances when Mr Breeze, who was the other party to the conversation and who has put a submission to the committee in considerable detail, has no trouble recalling the circumstances&mdash;and spelt them out. In those circumstances, it is absolutely necessary for the committee to have the power, to have an ability, to pursue this defence of public interest immunity to enable people such as Dr Roberts to give evidence unfettered to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If they are allowed to do that, we are much better placed to cast ultimate judgments on how it came to be that such a request was made after the event.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To have the likes of Senator Loosley outside the country telling people, no doubt, that this is simply a committee that is going nowhere and is a national disgrace is just typical of the approach that his whole culture has told him is the way to respond to issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the proposition before the Senate today needs to be reiterated because its seriousness may not be clear to those who are listening to this debate, particularly after the contribution of the last speaker. Essentially, the motion moved by Senator Kernot seeks to refer a bill on public interest immunity to the privileges committee, and requests that an extension of time be granted to the circus known as the print media inquiry. In essence, what we have heard from both the Liberal Party and from the Australian Democrats is that the proposition by Senator Kernot in the bill is not perfect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that Senator Kernot has said that, and it is a proposition that I am only too happy to agree with. It does not prohibit the prospect of public servants and citizens of this country being gaoled by this Senate. That is a very important point to make. When people are polishing up their haloes on these issues, it is very important to understand that there are sections of this Senate that believe that this Senate should have more power than the United States Senate but that its citizens should have much fewer rights than American citizens. That is a proposition I find very difficult to come to terms with, particularly from those who claim to be representing the democratic traditions of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also said that, on the question of public interest immunity, the legal precedent the government is operating on is shaky, that somehow or another the body language of witnesses before the committee indicates that the government is in a weak position. Body language is a unique legal concept that I have yet to understand, and I am sure that there are many very learned senators on the other side who will explain to me the legal precedents for the concept of body language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the legal opinion the committee sought and then tried to suppress. First of all, clause 52 of that legal opinion indicates that a court would probably uphold any claim to public interest immunity on the class of documents referred to as category one. Secondly&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;clause 55, on page 28 of that legal opinion, states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be also no reason why such views might not be expressed strongly by the executive government, and no reason why that government should not tell its employees, former employees, advisers and former advisers, and its own former members, that it intends to claim that the questions should not be answered or the documents not produced.</PARA>
<PARA>To suggest that the legal opinion on which the government is operating is somehow shaky seems to me to ignore the very opinion the committee itself sought to suppress because it thought it was going to contradict its position. It strikes me that we have further examples today of just what a three-ring circus this whole committee has turned into. As many committee members I am sure would be aware, the media comment on this to date has highlighted just how ridiculous the whole thing has become. The committee is described essentially as a third-rate soap opera. I think that pretty much sums it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was founded on a spurious  presumption that there was some sort of deal involving control of Fairfax for balanced coverage. We have seen no evidence to support that conclusion, none whatsoever. What is relied upon is a tongue-in-cheek remark made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in Seattle. What is ignored are the repeated denials of that proposition, not just by Mr Keating but by Mr Black. What is ignored is that the overwhelming body of evidence in Fairfax is that a cultural change within Fairfax led to its newspapers becoming more conservative. In fact, three out of the four titles supported the discredited opposition in the last election; they were so far out of touch in the last election that they backed the conservatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this, to me, does not suggest evidence of a deal. All of this points to the fact that the cultural change within Fairfax is more in support of the opposition's position in politics than of ours. But those opposite choose to ignore that. What we see here is an attempt to use the Senate as a device to pursue the political agendas of a group of people who are increasingly becoming locked into the perpetuity of opposition. Essentially, what we are seeing here is the fourth attempt to extend the terms of this whole circus. Four attempts have been made to extend the circus to keep it in town for yet another couple of months. Why do those opposite do that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look around the committee and I see the horsehair wigs being metaphorically placed upon the heads of members of the coalition. They see themselves in some sort of glorious light as judges able to cast aspersions upon the motives and morality of other Australian citizens. That is very good of them. What emerges is that the committee chairman in particular has more power through this committee than he is otherwise ever likely to have. It provides him with an opportunity to lord it over other people and to pontificate upon the activities of other people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been said that nothing has come out of this committee. I agree in essence that that is probably right, with one exception: the Liberal Party has decided that it will consider a change in its foreign investment policy. I suppose that is an achievement, in a strange sort of way. We need to understand the hypocrisy that surrounds the operation of this committee. I make no pretence in relation to my position. I am here, and the nature of these sorts of committees is such that we are obliged to act in certain ways to defend the position of the government. It is very much a partisan committee. That is the nature of the establishment of these types of committees. The appropriate committee to consider the substantive issues is the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, but that was not used because it does not have the same high profile. It does not get the same media attention as a special committee such as this gets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the hypocrisy, what must be understood is that, at the time of the sale of Fairfax, the Liberal Party operated a policy of abolishing the FIRB. Statements put out at the time of the sale of Fairfax by Senator Alston, when there was an extension of foreign ownership of that company, welcomed and supported the increase in foreign ownership. Conrad Black was left under no illusion that the Liberal Party position was open slather on foreign ownership. So we must challenge whether people are entering this matter with proper balance and a proper sense of propriety as to the way in which they are operating. Of course, they are not. </PARA>

He has to use these sorts of committees to bore it up a few people. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 14 April reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston told Mr Willis that unless Mr Pooley answered questions, adverse findings could put his "reputation as a competent and able public servant responsible for the prudential control of superannuation assets amounting to many millions in question".</PARA>
<PARA>That is a shocking abuse of power, a shocking abuse of civil liberties, and an absolutely outrageous threat to intimidate witnesses. What do we see before the committee itself? It could be claimed that Senator Alston has been misrepresented. It could be the old story&mdash;he has been misrepresented by the shocking <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. So let us look at what happened before the committee itself. I want the Senate to understand what occurred. In Sydney, on 21 April 1994, Senator Alston, speaking as the chairman, using his full metaphorical force and breathing down the microphone, said to Mr Pooley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And I would presume that you would also agree that you are uniquely placed to assist us if you were able to do so, and if you choose not to do so, then you would understand that the committee may well have to proceed on a basis which may well result in drawing adverse inferences which may reflect on your competence or integrity.</PARA>
<PARA>What an outrageous abuse of the power of this Senate to attempt to intimidate witnesses. He said to Mr Pooley:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I presume you have reflected on all those matters.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is important that we hear Mr Pooley's response. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In circumstances where there is an allegation about something and the person concerned is not in a position to respond, for one proper reason or another, I would have thought it was proper for the committee to conclude that that person was not in a position to say anything about that matter.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the whole point, is it not? Instead of attacking the government on the question of public interest immunity, which is something the honourable senator has not understood&mdash;it is a bit easier to say, `We do not really understand what the government's position is'&mdash;he tries to attack defenceless public servants. He attempts to threaten them with gaol. He intimidates them by suggesting that he is going to cast adverse aspersions upon their character. That is totally inappropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it very interesting that Senator Alston feels it necessary to attack Senator Loosley's character. That is all well and good. He suggests that somehow or other witnesses have been briefed&mdash;because it adds to the whole flavour that somehow or other this is a judicial inquiry. This is not a judicial inquiry. This is not an inquiry that has the trappings, the support or the imprimatur of law. This is an inquisition. This is a political tribunal aimed at attacking individuals. It is not a court of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that somehow or other witnesses appeared before this committee as if they were before a court of law and that senators on this committee were judges is totally outrageous. It suggests powers and responsibilities that senators do not have, powers that they may well like to have but which they do not have. This is a political inquiry, and it was a political inquiry from beginning to end. What is being proposed is to extend the circus for another few months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the committee will fall flat on its face. The whole committee has been demonstrated again and again to be ludicrous. It was based on a false presumption that there was an alleged deal done. No evidence was produced; no evidence adduced. The substantive questions of foreign investment should have been referred to the appropriate standing committee of this Senate, which, of course, does function, as Senator Kemp knows, without the sort of nonsense that goes on in this committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one big exception is that this committee does not have the glare of publicity about it. When senators have as little to offer as those opposite, they desperately need the publicity. That is what this is all about. It is an attempt to get publicity at a time when those opposite have very little to present to the people of this country. They have no real policy on these issues. We have not seen their policy yet. They have had plenty of time to come up with it, but we have not seen it. What we have seen is that they are considering a change in their policy. Their position to date has been the abolition of the FIRB and they are now saying that they are prepared to consider that. I suppose that is something in itself. I look forward to reading carefully what those opposite have to say on the question of foreign investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of the arrangements with Fairfax, I draw to the attention of those opposite once again to the fact that Fairfax has become a much more conservative body under the present media ownership.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike Senator Carr's hysterical and irrelevant outburst, I would like to speak to the motion before the Senate. The opposition supports the motion that has been moved by Senator Kernot, and I enjoy the opportunity to speak in favour of it. The sticking point in relation to this debate is part (4) of the motion, which refers to the timetable for reporting of the print media inquiry. This is the so-called linkage provision which seems to be the difference of opinion between us and the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point to make is that it is quite proper and reasonable for the print media inquiry to be given the opportunity to comment on the outcome of a privileges committee report on Senator Kernot's bill. The print media inquiry, as item (4) notes, is going to report on everything else by 9 June, and I think the government seems to have missed the point. The print media inquiry will report on just about every substantive issue that is considered in this very worthwhile inquiry by 9 June, so I cannot understand this amazing and hysterical outburst from the government today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that this motion seeks to do is allow the print media inquiry the opportunity, which it is quite reasonable for it to have, to comment on the outcome of the report of the privileges committee. The privileges committee is due to report by 23 August, and this motion gives the print media inquiry the time and opportunity to comment on that report. Nothing more is sought than that, and the outburst from the government today is quite irrelevant and ridiculous.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry simply seeks to reserve the right to comment on the privileges committee report. The point we need to make and understand is that this issue has arisen directly out of the print media inquiry. That is why we think it quite proper and reasonable for the inquiry to reserve that right. This is a function of this inquiry. This is the issue that has been highlighted by the print media inquiry endeavours and hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have had through this print media inquiry is a complete refusal of the government to cooperate with this inquiry, a legitimate inquiry brought into being by a majority of this Senate which reflects a majority of the people of Australia. The government has placed public servants in a quite invidious position in its determination to refuse their right to appear before us and give evidence and present documents. The government has frustrated completely a legitimate inquiry by this Senate into a very major public policy issue, and that is the ownership and operation of newspapers in this country and the wider point of the  operation and effectiveness of the FIRB. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from Senator Loosley today a most outrageous attack on the very effective chairmanship by Senator Alston of this committee. The reason those opposite have become so hysterical is best summed up in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Adelaide Review</EMPHASIS> of this month by David Bowman who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cause of it all, the one who deserves to be pilloried by the Senate inquiry into the Conrad Black affair, remains in the shadows, amused, perhaps, by the recent fireworks display before the Senate committee and by the media, which have lost the plot. The Prime Minister, of course. It is his conduct that is at the heart of the thing, not Conrad Black's, not John Hewson's, nor anyone else's. It won't stand up to the least examination, which is one good reason for his refusal to appear before the Senate committee.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the reason the government has performed in the way it has today and throughout the hearings of this committee. The government is terrified of and hates this committee. It does not have the numbers on the committee and does not like that. Hence its behaviour. It has attempted to do everything it can to prevent this committee inquiring into what, on the face of it, is one of the most outrageous deals that has ever been done in the history of government-media relations in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not like being in a minority. The minority it has is a direct reflection of the pathetic result of the government in the last Senate elections when it came back into this place with its tail between its legs and only 30 members. It is the government's fault that it does not have the numbers and cannot control these things&mdash;because of the results obtained in the last Senate election, which are a reflection of what the Australian people think of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This print media inquiry has put the spotlight on deals those opposite do all the time. They are a deal-making party. It is most extraordinary. I do not doubt that Conrad Black is terribly sorry for what he said in his book, but he exposed and put the spotlight on the way this government and its Prime Minister operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perfectly legitimate for the Senate to have set up a committee of inquiry to find out what really went on in relation to the ownership of one of this country's most significant newspaper outfits. What really happened? Before this committee was set up, Mr Black was one key player and Mr Keating was the other. Both say publicly that they had discussions and negotiations about the basis on which Mr Black would get an increase in Mr Black's ownership. Mr Keating said quite blatantly, `We want to see how you report politics over the next few months before the next election; and we want to make sure you have "balanced coverage".' Do those opposite really expect us to believe that Mr Keating was endeavouring to ensure that the coalition got fair coverage from Fairfax newspapers? That is a complete joke, and they know it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a major public policy issue which this inquiry has endeavoured to look into and put the spotlight on. The government hates having the spotlight put on it; and it is desperate to subvert and prevent this committee's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the government's frustrations with the committee's operations, given the government's determination to rely on public interest immunity, it leaves the Senate with no recourse other than to consider the punishment of public servants who refuse to cooperate. That is what is so insidious about the government's behaviour, putting public servants in that position. It is not a satisfactory position and, therefore, the Kernot bill has come forward as a potential resolution of this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston says, that may not be the best solution; it may need amendment, but it is quite appropriate that the Senate, through its privileges committee, consider the Kernot bill as a potential resolution of the problem the government has brought about by its refusal to cooperate with this legitimate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up, all I want to say is that the coalition totally supports this motion. It supports paragraph 4 which the government seeks to delete from this motion. I remind honourable senators that this issue is a direct result of the print media inquiry. It has come to national attention because of the print media inquiry&mdash;because of the government's utter intransigence and refusal to cooperate with this committee, and its determination to place public servants in a quite invidious position. Therefore, it is eminently reasonable for the print media inquiry committee to be given the opportunity to comment on the privileges committee report on this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope that I can seek to address the actual motion in the sense that I thought this debate was supposed to be conducted. As I understand it, the Democrats have had some discussions with the government in respect of the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill, which Senator Kernot introduced on 23 March 1994, insofar as there was agreement between the government and the Democrats with regard to the processes by which the bill would be dealt with. However, the government is opposed to the linkage to the print media inquiry, for the simple reasons that the terms of reference for this committee were set out and moved by Senator Alston and that this committee has now had an extension of time moved at least three times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to the committee's terms of reference, particularly point 6 and point 8. Point 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, without limiting its power to pass procedural or other resolutions that are not inconsistent with . . . these terms of reference, the Committee observe the following procedures, namely, that:</PARA>
<PARA>And it goes on to talk about submissions and the calling of witnesses, et cetera. We have now had three delays in this committee's reporting to the Senate. It is required under the standing orders, as I understand it, to conduct its business and then report to the Senate on its findings. Paragraph (4), which Senator Kernot is proposing as part of her resolution, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media present its first report by 9 June 1994, and the committee present a final report by 22 September 1994; and during the period from 9 June to the day on which the committee presents its final report the committee be provided with, and use, the minimum resources required for giving effect to this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>Essentially, as I understand it, that is aimed at trying to achieve a resolution of this dispute about the government's claim to public interest immunity over certain documents in that there are claims with regard to the government's position and the non-government members of the committee have a view that this committee should have access to certain documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to relate to a letter from the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to the chairman of the committee. The letter shows&mdash;and it is certainly our view&mdash;that the government has indeed cooperated with this committee in providing information and documents to the extent that it ought, given its responsibility to the public of Australia. That also includes the business community of Australia, which this government often has dealings with. In many of those dealings, I would suggest, the business community would require some of those discussions, documents and information that are exchanged between government and business to remain confidential. I think all members of the committee accept that as a fact. I do not think anyone has disputed that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to this public interest immunity claim, it was my understanding, as a member of the committee, that we sought legal advice as to the grounds on which we could require witnesses or the government to provide information. We received advice from Mr Jackson QC. Certainly, in his first set of legal advice, in clause 52, he said that, on the basis of the information provided to him with regard to the government's position, it had classified the documents which the committee sought. He believed, on the basis of other legal proceedings and other cases, that the government's position would be upheld and that those documents classified as category 1 would indeed attract a public interest immunity claim. Certainly, he indicated that the Treasurer and, indeed, the FIRB had provided all the other documents. We do not even know what documents might remain. Certainly, if we take the evidence of people who have appeared before us&mdash;in particular, former Treasurers Dawkins and Kerin&mdash;there would be no other documents of relevance to this committee's proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we spent nearly $10,000 on getting legal advice to provide us with guides about how we would proceed. My understanding was that if the advice was supportive of, or indicated support for, the government's position in certain matters then that would be the end of that. But that does not seem to be the case. We seem to want to go on and on. One question I want to ask Senator Kernot is: if, at the end of the day, when we get to 27 September when this proposal says we will have a final report&mdash;and, of course, the privileges committee will have reported back on Senator Kernot's proposal&mdash;that legislation is not enacted, what do the Democrats intend to do with respect to the final reporting of this committee?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is something that either Senator Kernot or the Democrats will have to respond to. We have to know, and I think the taxpayers have a right to know, what we intend to do thereafter if there is no legislation in place&mdash;as is being sought by this course of action&mdash;that will allow this matter to be referred to the courts in an attempt to get some decision at, I think, a substantial cost to the taxpayer. Nevertheless, if that is not the case&mdash;if there is no legislation&mdash;when is this committee going to finally report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to pick up one point with regard to Senator Alston's claim about Senator Loosley not attempting to reach consensus. In the very early stages of this committee's life it was suggested by Senator Loosley that its members meet with Treasurer Willis with a view to working out a possible process for looking at the documents in question, and/or, indeed, trying to ascertain whether there were any documents in question. That was ultimately refused by the opposition members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the role of FIRB in this whole process, I think it is important that people understand that FIRB, in relation to the terms of reference of this inquiry and a lot of the issues that were raised about FIRB's involvement, had no role to play in the sale of Fairfax. There seem to have been a lot of claims about the FIRB minute that supposedly contained inaccurate information about the AIN bid. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot knows that neither the government nor FIRB had anything to do with the final decision about who bought Fairfax. That was a decision for the receivers who, ultimately, chose the bidder who would end up owning Fairfax. It was nothing to do with the government and nothing to do with FIRB. FIRB's role in this process was to make a recommendation on the foreign bids that had been placed in an attempt to buy Fairfax. FIRB had nothing to do with the sale other than to make sure that those foreign bidders met the guidelines of the criteria in respect of foreign bids for ownership of print media in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it quite ridiculous when we have had legal advice, and subsequent legal advice which did not really much change from the initial legal advice, except that Mr Jackson referred to the minute of FIRB that had been made public and said that that would no longer attract public interest immunity. That argument ultimately led to Treasurer Willis's letter to acknowledge that yes, indeed, it was a copy of the minute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, considering all of those things in looking at what is proposed here, the government, as I understand it, has agreed essentially to the proposal from Senator Kernot to have her bill referred to the privileges committee. But we cannot accept&mdash;on the basis that we do not know, we will never know, and this motion certainly does not put in place&mdash;a time for this committee to finally report. It is no good saying that it says 22 September, because we have had three other goes at this&mdash;5 May, and some other date and yet another date&mdash;and we have never got there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Kernot this because I want her to clarify what her position will be when we get to 27 September and there is no legislation enacted that allows this matter to be referred to the court. As I understand it, that is the proposition in her legislation. We would like to know because we do not believe that it is correct to continue to waste taxpayers' money for no worthwhile purpose. Senator Kernot says in her proposal:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate has no remedy against these refusals to provide information and documents, except its power to impose penalties for contempt;</PARA>
<PARA>That is true. She also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate probably cannot impose such penalties on a minister who is a member of another House;</PARA>
<PARA>That is true. She goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be unjust for the Senate to impose a penalty on a public servant who, in declining to provide information or documents, acts on the directions of a minister;</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is very true, and that is where the dilemma is. The Senate does have, as Senator Kernot has pointed out, the power to get those documents by saying, `Okay, we find public servants'&mdash;in this case Messrs Hinton and Pooley&mdash;`in contempt of the Senate, and therefore we place one of them in gaol', which then ultimately leads to an appeal in the court to find out whether or not there are documents and whether or not they are relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot really has an obligation to the Senate, as this committee does, to inform the Senate of when it will report. The whole process of this debate has ebbed and flowed with regard to personal abuse, et cetera. I am not going to go into that, but I would like the Democrats to state their position clearly when we get to 27 September. Is that the end of the game or are we going to see another extension of time sought for some other period of six months, or whatever the case may be? Senator Kernot has a responsibility to the Senate to indicate that. </PARA>

The issue of public interest immunity is not simple; clearly, there are matters which this or any other government cannot have carried out in the full light of day. From the print media committee's perspective, on the one side are the arguments of the Senate's right to information and the public interest in knowing the basis of a crucial decision affecting a key section of our media. On the other side, there is the matter of how the Foreign Investment Review Board operates and works, and a wider fundamental question of the confidentiality of official advice to this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice received by the Senate committee from Mr Jackson QC, as we heard, is simply that public interest immunity cannot be claimed per se.

I am speaking particularly as a member of the privileges committee, which is now asked by this resolution to cast aside all the other work that it has before it and participate in this publicity stunt for Senator Kernot and Senator Alston. In fact, we are not going to be casting aside all the other work; this matter can be taken on top of the other work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has any consideration been given by the movers and supporters of this motion as to what the other work of the privileges committee might be? Have they given consideration to reporting dates connected with the committee's other work? I doubt it very much because in this particular motion we are not interested in getting to the issues; we are interested in a bit of cheap publicity. That is the end game of what we are talking about here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me deal with some of the other items contained within this motion. The Senate is going to give the privileges committee a reporting date, under item (2):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate refers to the Committee of Privileges, for inquiry and report by 23 August 1994&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>three months hence&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994, and requires the committee to give particular attention to the effectiveness of the bill in providing a solution to the problems set out in this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>Can the privileges committee accomplish the task in that time? Has any thought been given to whether or not it is possible or feasible for the committee to do that? When will the privileges committee address this matter after it has been referred to it? Today is the last sitting day in this block of fortnightly sittings. Does the committee convene on 23 May? Unfortunately, I am not going to be in attendance at that meeting because of other parliamentary commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose on 23 May the committee will sit down and address the issue of advertising this particular reference to encourage submissions and put a closing date on those submissions. Depending upon the number of submissions, the committee will probably then decide to have public hearings so that the evidence can be heard in public and we can have more stunts for the television cameras. Then we will sit down and deliberate on our response. That is fine if the seven members of the privileges committee have nothing else to do in that period of time, but many of us have many other commitments. One of the those commitments is the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Very recently a reference was given to that committee by the chamber with yet another unrealistic reporting date to which a notice of motion for extension of time has had to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many times have senators who are chairs or deputy chairs of committees had to come back to this chamber to ask for extensions of time due to unrealistic reporting dates being originally set down&mdash;unrealistic dates such as the one in the issue before us, a private member's bill? Not enough thought has been given in this chamber to the work of parliamentary committees. That lack of thought is bringing some committees into disrepute because we cannot meet our dates. As an afterthought, I indicate that from time to time some extensions have had to be granted for reasons of the work of the committee and not because of the unrealistic reporting dates. I move on to item (3) of the motion, which says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)For the purposes of the committee's inquiry into the bill, a senator nominated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats be added to the membership of the Committee of Privileges in a non-voting capacity.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an extremely interesting clause. It is an interesting clause to those senators who were here a few years ago and who recognised that the Australian Democrats had a nominated position on the privileges committee of the Senate. But there is no Democrat senator on that committee now. The Democrats gave the position away; they could not fill it. The Democrats were so inundated with other work that they were not able to have a Democrat senator as a member of the Senate privileges committee. I accept that; I understand why that is. As returning officer for the Australian Labor Party, the government party, I know that from time to time we too have difficulty in filling nominations for committee positions; and that has become even more of a difficulty in recent years. The Democrats accepted the reality of that at the time and allowed their nominated position to be taken up by the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But now, because there is a bit of publicity around, they want to be attached to it. That is the reason&mdash;a bit of cheap publicity&mdash;that they want to be attached to it, not because they have senators with time on their hands who could serve on the committee. That is not the case at all. If that were the case, they would fill the vacant position on the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, migration being an issue which the Democrats are supposed to be interested in. But when push comes to shove, they do not have a senator to serve on that committee. There is a vacancy on that committee at the moment.

However, I have a great fear that the committee system is being abused at the moment. I again refer the Senate to page 50 of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS>, which indicates 42 committees, including joint committees, that are in existence.

That was, of course, the contest between the monarchy and the parliament of the day. Here we find ourselves, 300 years later, still dealing with this most important topic. He stated further on in the same article:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The really difficult question now is the power of the Senate to call to account a government that depends for its majority on the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>That is, indeed, a most important question. Senator Kernot's motion is a well-thought-out motion which refers this matter to the privileges committee, of which I happen to be a member. I note that the reporting date is 23 August. I would partly agree with Senator McKiernan's comments that that committee does have a great deal on its agenda and that an extension of time could well be required. Nonetheless, this is a most important issue and one which should not be glossed over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it was during the course of this inquiry that the Treasurer, Mr Willis, went public on the matter. I cite the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 9 May this year:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government should publish reasons for its decisions to accept or reject big foreign investment proposals in future, to avoid controversies like the one surrounding the Fairfax takeover, the Treasurer, Mr Willis, has said.</PARA>

<PARA>You see, Madam Acting Deputy President, this is a most important issue before the Australian public. It is a most important reference that has been made to a Senate committee. During the workings of that committee it has found that there has been a problem in collecting and taking evidence because key public servants have claimed public interest immunity. What we have open to us, of course, is a devil and the deep blue sea option; namely, we cite them for contempt and they face the risk of imprisonment&mdash;which is entirely unsatisfactory, and Senator Kernot's motion makes that very point&mdash;or we do nothing about it. Senator Carr said that there are some who think public servants should be gaoled on this matter. I can state quite unequivocally that there is no-one, to my knowledge, in this chamber who believes that to be the case. </PARA>

It cannot get access to information, on behalf of the Australian people, I might add, into how the workings of this Foreign Investment Review Board take place, because the public servants, who are really the meat in the sandwich, have been directed by the Treasurer not to answer these questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an entirely unsatisfactory state of affairs and one which, I believe, the people of Australia will not tolerate. We are the elected representatives and the people of Australia expect us to do our job&mdash;that is, to carry out our parliamentary duties in a forthright manner. And that includes the committee system, which, indeed, includes obtaining evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing should stand in the way of the interests of the Australian people, or the democracy of this country. We have found with this inquiry that there is a brick wall which the Senate committee has come up against; and, in the interests of truth and democracy, it cannot go any further. That is really the issue we are facing today, the one which P.P McGuinness cited as being one of the most important issues to be decided in Australia this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the government does not even have issue with this motion, apart from paragraph (4); and I might address some remarks to that. The government would want this matter to be referred to the privileges committee, but not so that the print media inquiry might avail itself of the report of that committee. I believe it to be essential to the workings of this inquiry that it, firstly, have the report by the privileges committee in order for it to give a full account to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, it was this committee and its inquiry which has led to this very issue being here today. Inquiries often reveal defects and flaws which are not really the subject of reference. The Costigan inquiry was a case in point. It virtually brought down a government in the process of its investigation. This inquiry has happened to bring to the attention of the Senate and the public of Australia a most important point, and I believe that is why it is essential that paragraph (4) be linked to the print media inquiry. I believe the government is shirking its responsibility in trying to excise that paragraph from the motion. As Senator Kernot said, she was not simply sitting at home one Sunday and thought that it would be a good idea; it was the process of this inquiry which brought this to the fore. Indeed, that is what the press has acknowledged and that is what is being acknowledged publicly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst on paragraph (4), I point out to the Senate and the people of Australia that it recommends that the committee present its final report with `the minimum resources required for giving effect to this resolution'. By extending the matter to take into account the privileges reference, the question of added cost is indeed being addressed. I understand that this committee will operate henceforth at an average of $100 a day, and the cost will be minimal compared with that of other inquiries which we have had to date. I recall that the inquiry into the building industry in New South Wales ran into millions of dollars&mdash;I think some $30 million. As we are looking at one of the most important political issues this century, the extra $10,000 required really pales into insignificance when we look at the way money has been spent on other inquiries. I believe that should be borne in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would correct Senator Carr on one matter that he raised. He said that the coalition was hell-bent on the abolition of the Foreign Investment Review Board. He is about six years out of date, I believe. That might have been the policy about six years ago, but certainly it is not the policy of the coalition today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not underestimated the importance of this reference, nor of this motion. I believe that this will provide a solution to the workings of this committee and subsequent committees. Whatever motives might be attributed to it by the government, I can tell honourable senators, on behalf of the coalition, that there is an earnest desire to see this aspect cleared up. We do not want to leave in limbo the question mark over the powers of Senate committees and the powers they have in relation to witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Jackson, QC, provided a thorough opinion on this matter and one we have drawn our own understandings from. That highlights the uncertainty of the issue; not even counsel as eminent as Mr Jackson could give us a definitive ruling on the matter. Members of the committee have their own understanding of the opinion because of the uncertainty that prevailed. Once this reference is made and has been gone into thoroughly by the privileges committee, we can help clear up that uncertainty; and there will not have to be recourse again by a committee to legal counsel on the matter because the matter will be resolved. </PARA>

The senators are the ones who make the decision. It is wrong in my view for senators simply to adopt the opinion given by legal counsel, or the clerk for that matter, simply because it is given.

Subparagraph (1)(h)(i) of the motion on the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994, introduced in the Senate by Senator Kernot on 23 March 1994, provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the enforcement by the Federal Court of the lawful orders of the Senate and its committees, particularly orders for the production of information and documents.</PARA>
<PARA>I cannot imagine a Federal Court being happy about entering into the political give and take of this place to enforce its orders above and beyond what parliament does. I would have thought that, if that were carried, it could be successfully challenged on the basis that that subclause tries to raise a Federal Court above the parliament. The Federal Court is a creature of this parliament, and it seems to me to be a most absurd proposition that a creature of this parliament should be placed in a position to enforce the orders of the body that created it. I do not see how it can get any greater power than this parliament has. I would have thought there was some real concern about that. Subparagraph (h)(ii) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">avoidance of any imposition of a penalty on a public servant for acting under the directions of a minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There may be some occasions where we would want to impose a penalty on a public servant, even though he or she is acting under the direction of a minister. It might not be a severe penalty, but there are certainly occasions when we might want to do that. Subparagraph (h)(iii) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the adjudication and determination by the Court of any claim of executive privilege or public interest immunity, through the examination of the disputed evidence or documents by the Court.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, it seems to me to be creating a most absurd situation where a court&mdash;the creature of this parliament&mdash;determines the processes by which this parliament will operate. The way out of this, if we want something done and the courts to do it, is to refer that issue to a royal commission or a judicial committee, or some sort of body like that, to inquire into and decide on the proposition that is put. But I do not think that, once the Senate undertakes a task, we can have the courts coming in and, as it were, exerting more power than the Senate can. Paragraph (2) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Senate refers to the Committee of Privileges, for inquiry and report by 23 August 1994, the Parliamentary Privileges Amendment (Enforcement of Lawful Orders) Bill 1994, and requires the committee to give particular attention to the effectiveness of the bill in providing a solution to the problems set out in this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, I have great admiration for the Committee of Privileges, but it cannot raise itself above the Senate either. It is a creature of the Senate. No matter what is decided by the privileges committee, we are going to get argument back and forth in this chamber. It seems to me that the proposition set out in paragraph (2) does not necessarily&mdash;and I think in reality would not&mdash;advance the settlement of this problem. Paragraph (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of the committee's inquiry into the bill, a senator nominated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats be added to the membership of the Committee of Privileges . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That seems to me to be eminently sensible and eminently fair. Senator Kernot is suggesting a series of propositions. In spite of the good intent and the, on the face of it, sensible attempt to get around the problems, we are faced with the difficulty that, in the end, it comes back to the political give and take between the parties in this chamber. Even though we go through this exercise, unless the talking convinces people of the political reasonableness of Senator Kernot's propositions, in the end she is not going to get terribly far with this motion. Paragraph (4) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Select Committee on Foreign Ownership Decisions in Relation to the Print Media present its first report by 9 June 1994, and the committee present a final report by 22 September 1994; and during the period from 9 June to the day on which the committee presents its final report the committee be provided with, and use, the minimum resources required for giving effect to this resolution.</PARA>
<PARA>From what I have heard in the debate so far, I take it that Senator Kernot hopes that the propositions that arise out of the inquiry and the reference to the Standing Committee of Privileges will enable us to use the proposals in the fourth proposition. The difficulty with that in my view is that we will not get agreement in the light of the political problems that surround the print media inquiry. I am not sure how Senator Kernot sees that propositions 1, 2 and 3 help her deal with proposition 4. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exercise we go through will be a useful exercise, no doubt, in clarifying issues, but in the end it will not come to any binding decision on the political parties in this chamber.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I want to briefly sum up. I think we have taken an awfully long time over this matter. It is important, but the views of Senator Cooney, for example, would be very welcome before the privileges committee rather than canvassing the success or not of these proposals in this particular debate. We have advice, in the same way as others have advice, that it is an appropriate mechanism. I guess my view is, given the choice between the brutality of numbers and the politics of this place, if there is a way in which that politicisation can be taken out of the process, we ought to explore the option.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to begin with the comments of Senator Carr, because there is one thing he said which absolutely cannot go uncorrected. He said that the bill does not deal with the issue. He said that under my bill public servants can still be gaoled. Everybody is forgetting the other sanction which is the fining sanction. The fact of the matter is that under my bill once the Senate commences an action it forfeits the right to follow the previous sanctions. Senator Carr obviously does not seem to appreciate this. That needs to be put on the record when we keep raising this little red herring of sanctions imposed on public servants following the ministerial direction claiming public interest immunity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr talked about it being a partisan committee because it is a select committee and not a standing committee. What a silly argument. Let him apply that to all of the committees that have existed in this place and see the important work that they have done. The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration was not an appropriate place to examine the detail of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He talked about witness intimidation; he talked about senators acting as judges. I have the clear impression that Senator Alston in the chair was very careful to ask all of the witnesses if they had access to independent legal advice, and to explain to them the processes that were available to us and the possible end result of those processes. I did not see anything intimidatory. It was all a matter of explaining their rights and options, and the consequences. I do not think it was ever done with a raised voice or with a menacing tone. It was very clear cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk about the cost of this extension and about the way in which this committee has already been extended. I think we need to go back to the reasons for the extensions. In the first instance, they were to accommodate the needs of key witnesses who were very busy people. I think it has been worth while extending the committee's reporting date to hear from Mr Conrad Black&mdash;for a whole range of reasons connected and unconnected with this inquiry&mdash;and to hear from Mr Colson, Mr Bob Hawke, Mr John Dawkins and Mr John Kerin, all of whom sought our indulgence in arriving at agreeable dates that they could fit into their own busy timetables. Mr Hinton from FIRB had the misfortune to break his ribs&mdash;independently&mdash;during the course of this inquiry. We extended to him the opportunity for time to fully recuperate before he would be recalled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After that, key witnesses exercised their right to reply to adverse comments that had been made about them by previous witnesses.

While we may have all thought, and I certainly did, that we might have been able to deal with this issue fairly promptly, it has not turned out to be as easy as that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Carr and others raised the idea of the cost of the inquiry. One of the terms of reference and, I think&mdash;modestly, because I put it there&mdash;an absolutely critical issue in the committee's inquiry, has been the operation and effectiveness of the guidelines of the Foreign Investment Review Board. The evidence of the witnesses who have been called to speak to this term of reference has been incredibly illuminating in terms of public policy, and a reading of the report will bear that out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we are talking about cost, let us get it into perspective. We are talking about a $1 billion decision, one which has been described by some witnesses as the most significant foreign investment decision made since the Second World War&mdash;and we are not entitled to spend maybe $10,000 between now and 22 September on making sure that we have canvassed all the options in coming to some sort of resolution of this issue. The issues are symbolic as well as factual, and we know that. The long-term cost is the cost of accountability, the cost of the processes of government and the contribution to the democratic processes of this country. How are we going to quantify that? The national accounts do not do that, but we know very well what it means. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan had some problem with my face being on television and this motion having attracted a couple of columns of press.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand his concern about the workload of all Senate committees&mdash;and he was reflecting his membership of the privileges committee&mdash;and I do not want to be unfair to Senator Gareth Evans, but the suggestion to deal with this bill in this way certainly came from him.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contributions by Senator Cooney and Senator McKiernan with respect to the long-term outcome of this motion came down to the fact that this was a political issue and would have a political solution. I need to say again: this does seek to depoliticise it; it does seek to put it into the hands of an independent tribunal. I do not know whether reference to a royal commission is appropriate; I suspect it is not. If senators want to worry about costs, they should worry about the costs of a royal commission.

<TITLE>Report</TITLE>
<PROCTEXT><PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Zakharov)</EMPHASIS>&mdash;On behalf of the President, I present the interim report of the Joint Statutory Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inquiry into the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report that I have just tabled on behalf of the President is the first report of the Joint Committee on the Broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings of its inquiry into arrangements for the radio and television broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings. It also reports on a further reference from both houses on certain of the general principles and standing determinations dealing with radio broadcasting of parliamentary proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report is in two parts: first, it proposes changes to the existing rules for the radio broadcasting of proceedings. These rules are described in the committee's general principles and determinations. They were established in the early days of radio broadcasting of the parliament and a number are no longer relevant. Some require revision because of new arrangements for the coverage of proceedings on a dedicated parliamentary broadcast network. Others no longer reflect community expectation about the coverage of proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended the adoption by both houses of new general principles. If agreed to, the committee proposes to alter its standing determinations in the manner described in the report. Such changes would permit, among other things, the broadcasting of proceedings of either house after 11.30 p.m. and at weekends.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, the report also expresses the committee's views on a proposal by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to broadcast a 24-hour news service on the parliamentary broadcast network at times when the network is not required for parliamentary broadcasts. The committee does not oppose the ABC's proposal, but recognises that in order for the proposal to proceed it would require the approval of the Minister for Communications. The committee insists that prior to any implementation of the proposal the ABC resolve with the committee some practical questions in relation to the operation of a news service on the parliamentary broadcast network.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to briefly refer to the matters that have been raised in the report because I think it is important that the broadcasting arrangements be well and truly brought up to date considering that most of the general principles and determinations date back to the 1940s and 1950s. I would particularly like to emphasise the change that is proposed to allow more flexibility in the allocation of broadcasts between the two houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years, people have complained about the inflexibility of broadcasts. The House of Representatives was broadcast on Tuesday and Thursday and the Senate on Wednesday. That allocation was observed regardless of the importance of or public interest in a debate in the other house. I was a member of the committee some years ago when there was a change of day. It was early in the period of the Whitlam government when the then Attorney-General, Senator Lionel Murphy, was making a very important statement in the Senate on a day that would otherwise have been a House of Representatives broadcast day. The committee altered the allocation of broadcasts on that occasion to allow the change. I think 1973 was the last time when that happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has taken the view that there should be more flexibility in the allocation of days, and even within a day, to allow for a change of broadcast to the other house when an important matter is being dealt with. In that way we would not have the ridiculous situation of, for instance, the Senate being broadcast while the Prime Minister is on his feet in the other place announcing an election. Of course, it does not have to be as significant an event as that. If there was an assessment that for a particular period of a day the allocation should be swapped to the other chamber, the proposal that is recommended would permit that to happen. The overall concern is that, over time, there should be a more or less equal allocation between the two houses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the standard allocation is concerned, it is proposed that the Senate be broadcast live on radio on Tuesday and Wednesday and the House of Representatives on Monday and Thursday. In the event of both houses sitting on Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the proposal is that the House of Representatives would be broadcast on Friday and Sunday and the Senate on Saturday. Such a determination would obviate the annoyance that occurred when we did sit on a Saturday a few months ago and people were not able to access the broadcast from either house because of a previous determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant thing I would like to draw attention to is the proposal by the ABC to use the parliamentary broadcast network for news broadcasts at times when the service is not required for parliament. The committee has indicated that it does not oppose this proposal, with certain provisos. I support the ABC proposal and, depending on how the news is presented, I think it is a good use of the resource that is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee draws attention to a suggestion, which I hope can be developed eventually to a proposal that can be adopted, to use the parliamentary broadcast network to rebroadcast at greater length&mdash;rather than just replaying question time, as happens at present&mdash;the proceedings of the chamber which was not broadcast live on a particular day . As we know, the rebroadcast of question time at present involves some editing. When there is an unanswered question or a point of order or when an answer to a question leads to a later personal explanation, those matters are edited out of the rebroadcast. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were to be a substantial rebroadcast beginning with question time, and the suggestion is perhaps four hours or something like that, that would allow for a rebroadcast not only of question time but also of any personal explanations that arose from it. It would allow coverage of MPIs, urgency motions or significant ministerial statements that are made later in the afternoon. It would also obviate the need for the editing of the rebroadcast because balance would occur over such a substantial period. That proposal for further use of the network I think deserves to be worked into a more definite proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly support the ABC using the rest of the time for its proposed round-the-clock news service. Even when rebroadcasts of a significant period of debate in the other house are happening, the ABC could interrupt that rebroadcast for five or 10 minutes every hour for a news broadcast, in recognition of the fact that, once the promotion of this network happens to a greater degree, people will look to it to catch up on the news. With those brief comments, I endorse the report of the committee and look forward to the Senate debating and, I hope, adopting the recommendations and the new, simplified and more up-to-date principles that are proposed by the committee. </PARA>

I moved the motion, after some considerable debate, both internally and in this place, to have the televising, as opposed to the broadcasting, of proceedings started on a trial run in the Senate. The motion was accepted, and the House of Representatives saw good sense and followed our lead in that respect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important not to forget that, while we and the community pay an enormous amount of attention to those elements of parliament that are televised, nonetheless a very significant proportion of the community has as its primary source of information about parliament and politics the broadcasting of parliamentary services. It is very important that we do not simply lose our priorities and believe that television is everything and forget the importance of keeping the parliamentary broadcasting arrangements up to date. I think this report makes a contribution to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be further reports from that committee on how we can extend the access of the community to parliament because, after all, we need to remind ourselves every day that so very few people live in the Australian Capital Territory. Many people might live in New South Wales and have not very expensive access to parliament; they can come along to see it on a fairly regular basis as a part of a tour. But for an enormous number of Australians their only access is through the electronic media.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In informing the Senate of the reactions of the business and finance sectors to the budget, I will quote from a transcript of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program this morning:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">International credit rating agencies have dismissed claims that the first Budget from the federal Treasurer, Ralph Willis, isn't doing enough to reduce debt. Both Standard and Poors and Moody's, consider this Budget to be a reasonable document which doesn't alter their view of Australia's credit worthiness.</PARA>
<PARA>It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the government's deficit reduction plans are in keeping with its longer-term aim to cut debt to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the international credit rating agencies. In the case of Standard and Poors they have also said that the budget is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in keeping with the Government's longer-term debt reduction strategy. . .</PARA>
<PARA>What was being said was that one could always complain but they saw no reason to do so in this budget. Moody's has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The budget is well within expectations and the numbers in the budget are quite comparable to their own.</PARA>
<PARA>That refers to the numbers calculated by Moody's, the credit rating agency. It is worth noting, although I do not put a great deal of store in market fluctuations, that the market has reacted well over the last day. In general, it can be said that financial and business sectors have endorsed our medium term deficit reduction strategy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, labour force figures came out which show that, seasonally adjusted, the unemployment rate has fallen from 10.3 per cent to 10.1 per cent. That is a positive sign, continuing on the back of other reductions in the level of unemployment in this country, that not only is employment growing but also, importantly, unemployment is being reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although it is true that it made qualifications, the ACCI&mdash;the biggest business organisation, I guess&mdash;in its bottom line comment, in providing a caption on its response to the budget, said that the budget will do much to build on business confidence. The Housing Industry Association&mdash;which is not an organisation that I have regarded as much different from a Liberal Party front, I might say, certainly in its behaviour up to the last election&mdash;in relation to the budget said, `It is good news for the housing industry.' The Mining Industry Council said that the budget will do nothing to jeopardise the growth and expansion of the economy. So from a number of quite conservative organisations in the business area that are quick to criticise, there are lukewarm and warm endorsements of the budget.</PARA>

That is the important part in looking at their analyses. In addition to that, a number of leading private sector forecasters have also forecast what the growth in business investment might be. BT Australia is forecasting an increase in business investment for the coming budgetary year by 15.6 per cent. The National  Australia Bank is predicting investment growth by 15 per cent; and CS First Boston by 14 per cent. The budget figure is 14.5 per cent.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="751" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The important thing to do in these situations is to look at the total context. Part of that total context is that the government actually brought forward the first round of tax cuts in the last budget against the projected timing of those cuts, representing in the process a significant gain to the great majority of the work force. Those tax cuts which were brought forward last year were targeted to the majority of the full-time work force on low to middle incomes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, of course, we saw the last budget bring in a new tax rebate for low-income earners which ensured that all taxpayers received at least $150 from the personal income tax cuts in a full year. Taken together, those measures delivered substantially more to taxpayers from the first round of tax cuts than was promised before the election. That is the first part of the context.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the context is that, of course, there is going to be some element of bracket creep in any situation where there is any inflation rate at all above zero and no adjustment to the actual tax scales. But the level of bracket creep that can be anticipated over the years ahead is going to be very much less than the levels of bracket creep that we have become accustomed to in this country over many years with many successive governments, simply because for so many of those years we have been living with inflation rates that are very much higher than those that we are looking at now and can expect to sustain in the period ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the degree of the bracket creep that is involved, as compared with the total size of the income tax take, is really very much smaller than has been a familiar part of the fiscal landscape for very many years under an opposition government as well as ours. The third point to make in reply to all this is that the government has not in any way reneged on its promised tax cuts for the future. They will be delivered in full. The timing, of course, was deferred last year&mdash;</PARA>

Those tax cuts will be delivered, as has been said by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer, around about 1998. That is our expectation. That particular deferral has been on the record for the best part of a year&mdash;since the last budget. It is a reasonable deal for Australian taxpayers to have some deferral of the next round of tax cuts in an environment where the bracket creep factor is going to be much less, as I have said, than it has been in the past, and in an environment where the last round of tax cuts are only just coming through to them, but they were in fact brought forward from that which was originally anticipated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What makes it a very good deal in total for Australian taxpayers is that the condition of the economy&mdash;opposition members can eat their hearts out&mdash;is much better than it has been for a very long time, and every single aspect of that economy, every single economic fundamental, is looking good at the moment.

The figures today show that unemployment is at its lowest level for two and a half years. Unemployment fell from 10.3 per cent in March to 10.1 per cent for April. Unemployment fell below 900,000 for the first time since April 1992. Unemployment in April was 875,100, which was down 89,300 for the past six months. Over the past year, employment increased by 236,400 and growth continued in April, with 6,000 new jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>

When employment is improving substantially, glumness overtakes the opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these figures there were increases in full time and male employment, which is very encouraging. Although the participation rate fell slightly by 0.2 per cent to 62.6 per cent, it remains well above the level at the same time last year, which was 61.9. Unemployment dropped in all states in Australia, with South Australia and Victoria showing significant improvement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's news, as I said before, follows the successful announcement of the employment package of last week and the budget of this week, all aimed to continue the improvement in employment and to get down to an unemployment level of five per cent by the end of this decade&mdash;a figure that has been derided by those opposite because they know that their political fortunes can rise only if unemployment rises.</PARA>

I have seen a copy of a press release by Dr Brendan Nelson.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Nelson argues that the Australian government's money is not new money and that this is a sleight of hand allocation of funding for Aboriginal health. I also have here&mdash;I hope opposition senators have seen this but, if not, I am delighted to tell the Senate about it&mdash;the press release from Dr Lawrence in reply to that argument, pointing out that the AMA's assessment of the federal government's expenditure on Aboriginal health is inaccurate and misleading, that the AMA has been using economic tricks to juggle the numbers, and that it is absolutely blatantly refusing to acknowledge the facts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Nelson is putting up very inaccurate figures, and Dr Lawrence is at pains to explain this. The national Aboriginal health strategy was due to expire at the end of 1995. As I pointed out in answer to a question yesterday, a review will be completed this year. That review will point out ways for the government to look at further funding and at the further direction of funding in the Aboriginal health area. But the government has added the new money to both continue that strategy and to increase the funding to it; and that is only part of our commitment to Aboriginal health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out yesterday, there are two sections to that money. The continuation of the national Aboriginal health strategy is a new commitment, fought for and won in cabinet. Not only is the government continuing money at that level but it is also dramatically increasing the amount. So it is very important to appreciate that Dr Lawrence has achieved not only a commitment in principle to Aboriginal health but a commitment in very significant dollars, an additional half a billion dollars over five years, thus trebling the amount spent on the strategy in the last three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is beyond dispute that the government is committed not only in words but also in deeds&mdash;in what it has delivered in dollars. I certainly urge senators to appreciate that Dr Nelson is muddying the waters with his facts&mdash;not the government. Very importantly, if people want to take issue with Dr Nelson, they might ask him why he is arguing with the government about its new money for Aboriginal health and why he is not arguing with his own doctor constituency about why specialists refuse to operate on public patients in private hospitals. The government has committed its dollars to that. The AMA constituency of Dr Nelson is not delivering. So Dr Nelson had better put his own house in order before he starts taking up tedious and inaccurate points of issue about the dollar and policy commitment of this government to Aboriginal health.</PARA>

Senator Evans will have a hard task to convince the Australian people that he and human rights committees should become involved and meddle in Australian disputes, particularly as he has been running the republican line now for a year and a half. My question to the minister is in relation to this particular committee, which he seems to think has the talents and expertise to become involved in Australian disputes. Can he explain why 10 of the 18 members of the committee are nominated by governments which have appalling human rights records?

The situation described by Senator Patterson has always been the case because each member of a couple has access to a free area.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question asked by Senator Lees this day, relating to health funding in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to note that the minister has agreed that the government did continue to fund Aboriginal health service. Therefore, if that was continuing funding, we have very little left of what the government is claiming is new money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go through two different possibilities to try to find out exactly what we are talking about when we are looking at new money going to solve the major problems faced by the Aboriginal community. If we take the existing level of funding, which is $70 million per year, and we extrapolate that over the five years, which is where the budget money is supposed to go to, we see that we have $350 million just to maintain the existing, inadequate level of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has split up this money with basically 30 per cent going to primary health care and the rest going to infrastructure. I would like to look at the primary health care money. If we take the $350 million from $499 million, we have left an amount of only $149 million over the five years; that is $29.7 million a year. If we then take 30 per cent of it, we are down to $9.1 million of new money to be spread right across the Aboriginal community for primary health care. It is nothing like what former Senator Richardson was suggesting, which was $160 million a year&mdash;$800 million over five years&mdash;for primary health care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Access Economics has taken the government's own budget and looked at what the government has said is going to be the rate of growth. It has let the budget for the national Aboriginal health service grow over each of the next five years by the government's stated amounts, and ends up with a figure of $414 million required to maintain the existing inadequate services. Taking this from the $499 million that the government has put in for the five years, we end up with only $85 million of new money&mdash;in other words, $17 million per year. Thirty per cent of that, which is directed to primary health care, leaves only $5.24 million of extra money to solve the enormous problems facing Aboriginal Australians. There is only $5.24 million to make any sort of inroad into the appalling problems faced by young children and adults, problems caused by the lack of immunisation programs and the lack of primary health care for everything from cut feet to a range of skin conditions, to inner ear infections, and for any programs for drug and alcohol treatment&mdash;$5.24 million spread across some 98 Aboriginal health services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see how this government can honestly believe that that is anything like adequate. Looking at community perceptions, I believe it is even worse than a con for the Aboriginal people because the community out there has taken the government at its word. In the last couple of days I have done several radio interviews, and the community says, `Wonderful! They've put another $500 million into Aboriginal health care.' The government has not&mdash;it is nothing like that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in 12 months time, when we see no improvement in Aboriginal health, when we do not see any change in the appalling infant mortality rates, when we do not see any change in the number of people suffering from drug and alcohol problems and when we do not see any change in life expectancy, the community will turn around and say, `Well, $500 million went in there. What happened? Was it all rorted somehow in the system? Did it all disappear down a drain somewhere?' We have to somehow get across to the community the message that this is a giant con, a three-card trick extraordinaire&mdash;one of the most disgraceful sleight of hand tricks that I have seen in my time in this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put the onus on the government to explain this $5.2 million. Perhaps I will let it get away with the $9 million if it is only going to fund Aboriginal health services to the same level. If we take that $70 million as the base funding for the Aboriginal health system, there is somewhere between $9 million and $5 million per year extra. I would like the government to now explain how the Aboriginal health services will get this money, how much each service will receive and what exactly the government hopes to achieve. </PARA>

I have with me the media release by the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) headed, `Major budget initiatives in breast cancer.' Looking at those figures, there is $236 million over five years for a continuation of the already established breast cancer screening program. The increase is to cover the women already recruited to the program who need to be re-screened two years later.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done nothing of the sort. Tillinghast has been conned in this giant hoax like the rest of the media. There has been no real increase at all. There has been $3.5 million allocated in the next year, but the $236 million is a continuation of the previous breast cancer screening program where $64 million was spent over three years. The government did not spend the total amount. If we look at the figures, the $3.5 million comes from the unspent money of the previously allocated funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the minister to tell me where are these major budget initiatives in relation to breast cancer. They do not exist.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the points raised by Senator Lees, I have been provided with the following figures and I think they actually extend the answer I was giving today. Pre-budget funding for the national Aboriginal health strategy only included $71 million for 1994-95 and zero for the years 1995-96 on. Any additional funding allocated to the national Aboriginal health strategy by definition has to be new spending. The total additional funding approved during the budget process is as follows&mdash;and I think there is a confusion here: the national Aboriginal health strategy is actually now under two streams of funding; the Aboriginal medical service and the housing infrastructure commitment. The figures for 1994-95 under the AMS are $25.1 million, for 1995-96 $37 million; 1996-97 $38 million; 1997-98 $39 million; 1998-99 $22 million. The H and I figures include $15 million in 1994-95, $77 million in 1995-96, $79 million in 1996-97, $81 million in 1997-98 and $84 million in 1998-99. So the total is $40.1 million in 1994-95, and then $114 million, $117 million, $121 million and $106 million, making a total of $499.4 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Aboriginal medical service there is $161.9 million and under H and I there is $337.5 million. We could debate forever whether an allocation that ceases in 1994-95 is therefore new money in the years beyond that. By any budgeting accounting, yes, it is.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now answer Senator Herron's question regarding breast cancer. I will tell Senator Herron why some of the money is not spent on breast cancer screening. Our state and territory colleagues who are to match the dollars&mdash;although the Commonwealth government put in an initial amount to help get it set up&mdash;have been dragging the chain. The worst chain dragger by far is the state of Victoria, and New South Wales is rapidly following that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An election is coming up in New South Wales, so suddenly Minister Phillips wants to claim all those unspent Commonwealth dollars and to say, `I am going to do great things.'

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons the Northern Territory is behind is that it is coming up with a very innovative program. It is not putting out into the field a mobile breast cancer screening unit but is adding to it general health services, and also cervical cancer screening. These services will be of benefit not only to the white rural community, but also to the Aboriginal rural community. The Northern Territory has negotiated with the Commonwealth to go through that process, so I think it is very important that we do not confuse the intentions of state and territory governments in joining the Commonwealth initiative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is important not to accuse the Commonwealth of falling behind in a screening program when it is no fault of its own.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I wish to speak on the same matter. I rose to speak about another aspect of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley). However, before I do so, I will briefly mention the Aboriginal health issue quite properly raised by Senator Lees today. In my view it does not much matter in total picture terms whether we accept the government's figure of $40.1 million or whether we accept the AMA's figure of $17 million. We know that it is nothing like the amount of money which has been portrayed by this government to the Aboriginal people and to the wider community as the amount of new money to be spent on Aboriginal health.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I totally endorse the comments made by Senator Lees about the enormity of the need for primary health care delivery and the lack of focus on Aboriginal health to a great degree in the past. Therefore, there should not be a fight about this; there should be concern and effort to put more resources into an important area of Australia's health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to move briefly to this question of breast cancer. I was appalled at the snide comment made by the minister regarding the opposition's attempt to encourage people to support breast cancer funding both by way of private donation and from the federal government. I think it is absolutely disgraceful for the minister to denigrate our attempts to take a bipartisan approach to this matter, which has been our intent all along, especially when we see the government's media machine working overtime trying to portray the wife of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as having led the debate in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister should not be talking about politics. Her government has played politics with the breast cancer issue. The government was late coming into the mammography issue about five years ago. We led the way on that; the government followed. We have been pursuing the government all along for its dilatory approach to getting mammography screening going. Carolyn Hewson, and Dr Hewson himself when he was shadow finance minister, supported strongly our policy of getting mammography screening going. I and many of my colleagues have been working on this issue for many years. We welcome Mrs Keating's involvement. However, we do not accept the snide comments that come from the minister or the propaganda that comes from the Prime Minister on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time left to me I want to talk about health research. There is a misunderstanding outside, just as there is with Aboriginal health funding, that somehow this government has done something wonderful about health research and also about breast cancer research. The breast cancer research funding in this budget&mdash;the actual amount of money that will go to breast cancer research in terms of new funding&mdash;is $1 million, and it will be by way of a dollar for dollar matching of private donations, capped to a limit of $1 million. So the government will put in $1 million if the public puts in $1 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a pity it is that the government will then spend  another $1 million on overhead costs for a new foundation to receive these private donations, headed by the Prime Minister's wife, and portray that as somehow putting money into breast cancer research. That is $1 million which could have been spent on attracting more public donations. Just think: if $2 million had been given by the government to encourage tax deductible private donations, something like $5 million might have been going into breast cancer research from the public with the support of the government. That, to me, is making best use of government funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going to the wider issue of health funding generally, we have a situation where the equipment is running down in our laboratories, our brightest people are not pursuing research options in the future&mdash;they are going out of that area&mdash;and programs that are under way already are only partially funded. We have a desperate need to do better. This government, despite its protestations, has not moved beyond one per cent of the health budget for funding on health research in this budget or in the expenditure for the coming calendar year. So the promise at the last election of moving to two per cent by the end of this decade will not be met unless we have a massive increase. </PARA>

The six states all have an increase in funding, so it must be recognised as something that needs to be increased.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question asked by the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Senator Boswell), relating to the funding of the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>The government has well and truly pulled the rug from under the wool industry in this budget. Not only has it taken away the exceptional circumstances provisions which existed, with the wool industry coming out of the worst period in its history, but it has removed any further assistance in terms of research funding and promotion for the industry&mdash;something that is traditional and is a contribution that has been made by successive governments for many years, certainly for as long as I have been involved in the wool industry. I find the comments made by Senator Collins rather ironic, in contrast to the comments made by Senator Gareth Evans at the National Farmers Federation conference dinner last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Collins to say here today that the price of wool had risen from somewhere around 380c a bale cleaned at about this time last year to 580c a bale cleaned now, and that the exceptional circumstances assistance was not required and should go, shows his total lack of knowledge of the industry, of how it operates, of the income flows and what the break-even points are in terms of running costs for that industry. It is particularly sad that, even in the depths of despair of the worst year in the wool industry's history, the industry still put over $3 billion into the Australian economy. Yet, at the same time, those people producing the wool were losing something like $5 for every sheep they had on their properties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see that the industry is getting close to a break-even point in terms of costs. At a time when individual producers were getting back to a situation where they would have qualified under the viability criteria to receive assistance, now those exceptional circumstances provisions have been removed. I think that shows the total lack of understanding by this government of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From last year, when the price was 380c, to now, when it has gone to 580c, at least 80 per cent of wool growers in this country would not have received $1 of wool income during that period of time. That will come in over the next two or three months, when most sheep are sheared and the income comes in. One must also recognise, which Senator Collins obviously does not, that it is the wool industry that underpins the infrastructure in rural and regional Australia. We hear a lot from this government with regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that Senator Collins mentioned is that the market signals were there to move to produce 19-micron wool. Senator Collins does not understand that it takes a 15- to 20-year breeding program to take a micron down an average of two microns. It is not something that wool growers can go out and do just like that: click their fingers, and suddenly have 19-micron wool. It requires a very sophisticated approach. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within that, there is also the impact of seasonal conditions, and the fact that there is a large percentage of Australia that is not suitable for growing 19-micron wool. It can be grown in certain areas of Victoria and New South Wales, a lot can be grown in Tasmania and in southern parts of Western Australia, but the great hinterland is just not suitable country. The feed is not suitable; the structure that is required of the sheep is not suitable. It is not as simple as what was portrayed to us here today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would do Senator Collins a lot of good if he were to get an understanding of how the wool industry operates, how breeding programs operate and how to change the quality in terms of micron. Of course, having 19-micron wool does not necessarily mean that it is good quality wool because there is good quality wool in the broader ranges. I think it is very sad. The answer that was given to us today is a bad reflection on the government, in terms of removal of the exceptional circumstances provisions and, particularly, Senator Collins's lack of knowledge about how to produce 19-micron wool and any other micron wool. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) needs a little explanation about sheep husbandry because in his answer today he said that the wool market was presently giving a simple market signal to producers to move to `higher quality wools' to take advantage of the improved price for 19-micron wool or finer. By this he means that to fine up the clip will provide a better return, and at the moment he is right because the 20-micron and finer wool is certainly looking very encouraging. Unfortunately, wool production is not that simple because, under normal circumstances, which are only theoretical because of the variation in seasons, it takes 15 years or more to move two microns by mere selective breeding within a flock. Therefore, to move from the 21.5- to 23-micron range, which is the great majority of the Australian clip, will take a long time, even if it were possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crane has said, it is not possible in the vast majority of the wool growing areas of Australia. It is not possible, or it is difficult, at Charleville in Queensland; it is not possible, or very difficult, at Clare in South Australia; and it is not possible, or difficult, at Cobar in the west of New South Wales. The nature of the country itself and the climate do not permit many breeders moving, by breeding, to meet the market that the minister talks about. The minister has talked, as I have said, of `higher quality wools' by selective breeding; in other words, to 19-micron wool or finer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, therefore, many breeders who require a general improvement in wool prices for them to survive.

These sports men and women, by their deeds, have not only written their names into the history books but also left a profound and lasting impression on the sporting psyche which is such a large part of the Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1976, a 21-year-old Allan Border began a first-class cricket career which today sees his name sit comfortably alongside those of Australia's sporting icons. Two years later Border was making his test debut against England, scoring, as I am sure Senator Ray knows, 29 and a duck, a modest debut when compared with the records he has since claimed; but one must remember that even Sir Donald Bradman managed scores of only 18 and 1 in his test debut, which coincidently was also against England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since that debut Border has stamped himself as one of the world's premier cricketers, playing a record 156 test matches, captaining Australia in a record 93 tests, compiling a record 11,174 test runs and taking a record 156 test catches. But Border, like Australia's true sporting champions, will not be remembered just for statistics and records. Rather, it is the qualities he displayed during his long and remarkable career that have struck a chord with Australians from all walks of life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Border appealed to average Australians because he was always the dependable, gritty and determined fighter whom everyone looked to when the Australian side was in trouble. Those fighting characteristics were never more evident than in the second test against the West Indies in Trinidad in March 1984, when he scored 98 not out and 100 not out against the most lethal pace attack in the world. It was those same qualities which stamped him as a leader and a natural choice for Australian captain when Kim Hughes stood down from the job in December of that year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Border's captaincy reads like one of his great innings. He came into the job at a time when Australian cricket was in real trouble and desperately searching for a hero. He simply set about his task with a minimum of fuss, earning the respect of his team mates, his opponents and the cricketing world at large. The strength, dedication and leadership shown by Border in those early years pulled Australian cricket back from the brink of disaster and set the Australian team on course for a victory in the 1987 World Cup and then an historic four-nil drubbing of England in 1989 to regain the Ashes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restoration of Australian cricket to a place of pride in the international arena is a true testament to the tireless efforts and leadership skills of Allan Border. His work and achievements as captain and his personal characteristics have been a source of great pride and inspiration to Australians and, on the international scene, have marked him as an outstanding ambassador for Australia and Australian sport. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Such has been his contribution that it is hard to imagine Australian cricket without Allan Border&mdash;AB&mdash;out in the middle calling the shots.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly gives me a great deal of pleasure, as Australia's minister for sport, to pay tribute to one of Australia's greatest ever  cricketers, Allan Border, who, of course, announced his retirement from test cricket yesterday. His achievements in test cricket have been absolutely remarkable: a record 156 test matches, 154 of which were consecutive, and a record 93 as the Australian test captain; and a record 11,174 runs at an average of 50.56. He made 27 centuries and 63 half centuries. He took a record total of 156 catches, and he took 39 test wickets at an average of 39.1. In addition, he holds the world record for one-day international appearances, of 273, in which he made 6,524 runs with a highest score of 127 not out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He became captain of the Australian test team during the 1984-85 series against the West Indies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also remarkable to consider that only one current test player&mdash;David Boon&mdash;has ever played under a different Australian captain. That is an excellent illustration of the ongoing importance to Australian cricket of Allan Border's career. Tributes have been flowing in from across the cricket world and throughout Australia to Allan Border. However, I think that the tribute paid by Australia's greatest ever player, Sir Donald Bradman, was particularly significant. Bradman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allan Border has given very long and distinguished service to Australian cricket and every one will wish him well in his retirement. Few people, if any, have graced the stage for as long as Allan and he can look back with pride.

<PARA>I feel privileged that I was able to witness Allan Border play every one of his test matches in Sydney, except for the 1992-93 series match against the West Indies. Regrettably, Allan Border has never made a test century at the Sydney Cricket Ground. However, I personally saw him score in excess of 1,000 test runs and take, I think, 14 of his 39 test wickets at the Sydney Cricket Ground. These performances included his memorable effort against the West Indies in that great Australian victory in 1989 when he took 11 wickets in that test match. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Border will be remembered in many countries around the world, particularly on the subcontinent where he led many tours to India and Pakistan and, of course, to Sri Lanka. He may well be the best-known Australian on the subcontinent. Unlike many of his English test captain counterparts, he never shirked his duty on the subcontinent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Border will be remembered by many thousands of Australians for his outstanding efforts on the cricket field. During his career he has embodied all the fighting spirit and admirable qualities of Australian character. Perhaps even more significant than his unparalleled sporting record is the fact that Allan Border leaves Australian test cricket with a long list of very good players queuing to get into our national team and at a time when there is genuinely a resurgence of interest in cricket amongst Australia's young men and women. </PARA>

I also like the way that in the face of his distinguished international career he has kept his sense of perspective as an Australian, and his humility.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It worries Senator Panizza, too! He might be surprised that I do not; but it is something we have to do. Allan Border has been a wonderful ambassador, as the motion says, for both Australia and Australian cricket. I know that he has always shown incredible patience with all the young kids on the cricket field as they pester him for his autograph. His family ought to be thanked, particularly his wife, Jane, for the contribution she has made, in the same way our partners make contributions to our lives which involve so much absence from home. I am not conscious of her ever complaining or showing a sense of frustration, but I am conscious of her always being a supportive partner so that he was able to use his talents to their fullest.</PARA></TALK.START>

We thank him for all the little armchair debates he has provoked around Australia, and for the style and grace with which he has played cricket. I really endorse part (c) of the motion, that we convey to Mr Border the sentiments of the Senate. I hope he gets to read the whole debate we have taken part in today. He is affectionately called `AB'. He would probably not even be aware of the fact that I used to be a cricket umpire. I would have loved to umpire a match with Allan Border so I could get to look closely at his style. As someone with a connection with cricket, I put on the record that Australian cricket will certainly miss Allan Border. </PARA>

It is certainly a great privilege for me to support the motion of tribute moved by my leader in the Senate, Senator Hill, and indeed to join in this tribute to Allan Border on his retirement, both as Australian test cricket captain and as an Australian player.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Robert Border was born on 27 July 1955 at Cremorne in New South Wales. As a child, he watched cricket and baseball being played on the Mosman Oval from the verandah of his home. Although his first-class cricket debut was made at the Sydney Cricket Ground, undoubtedly his early cricket nurturing was undertaken at the Mosman Oval, which was later renamed in his honour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan made his test debut against England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground 16 years ago, in December 1978, when the Australian test team was somewhat in disarray as a result of the defection of a number of its senior players to the Packer circus known as World Series Cricket&mdash;the private cricket competition arranged by Packer. In 1980 he was lured north to Brisbane to subsequently captain the Queensland state side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 he took over from Kim Hughes as captain of the Australian team, again when the Australian team's performance was at a low ebb. He subsequently captained Australia for 93 tests. Under his captaincy the Australian team began a steady reversal of its fortunes, which perhaps reflects his own persistence. It won the World Cup in 1987, took the Ashes from England in 1989, and, of course, as we recall more recently, earlier this year played the first test for 20 years in South Africa, which ended in a draw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1993 Border became the leading run scorer in test history on the second day of the first test against New Zealand at Lancaster Park during his 139th test match. Allan Border currently holds the world record for the most number of test runs&mdash;11,174 test runs at the outstanding average of 50.56. It is worth recognising that this amount of runs and this outstanding average were achieved against bowlers such as Ian Botham and Bob Willis representing England, Imran Khan from Pakistan, Kapil Dev from India, and the West Indian pace battery including Andy Roberts, Joel Garner and Curtly Ambrose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to his spectacular batsmanship, Allan has taken 39 test wickets, with his left-arm orthodox spinners, and held 156 test catches, also a record. He also holds the world record for having played 273 one-day international cricket games. In 1990 Allan Border received the Order of Australia. In December 1993 Allan Border was the first  non-retired player to have his portrait painted by artist Paul Fitzgerald, who has also painted the Pope and Her Majesty the Queen. The portrait was commissioned by the Melbourne Cricket Club after completion of Border's 150th test match. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Awe-inspiring as these facts and figures are, they paint an inadequate picture of Allan Border. Sir Donald Bradman, the greatest cricketer the world has known, said of him, `No batsman could match Border in his stubbornness to remain at the crease.' Honesty, talent, dedication, fortitude and persistence&mdash;these are just a few of the adjectives that spring to mind when thinking of Allan Border, who has displayed extraordinary sportsmanship in spectacular service to his country. Dubbed `Captain Courageous', after rescuing Australia from numerous potential batting collapses, Allan Border has set an admirable example for young and aspiring cricketers not only Australia-wide but indeed worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Numerous times I have been present at Adelaide Oval, which, after all, is the best cricket ground in the world, to watch with admiration and pleasure magnificent innings by Allan Border&mdash;as well as watching him on television broadcasts play on other grounds in Australia and, into the wee small hours of the morning, on overseas grounds. On many of those occasions I have perhaps wished I could have been out there with him, except that, in the words of Greg Champion, `I kept getting out.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Along with millions of other cricket lovers, I will miss Allan's presence both at the batting crease and in directing Australia's operations when in the field. I trust his tremendous knowledge and experience on the field will be put to the benefit of the game in some continuing activity now that he is off the field&mdash;as, indeed, was that of his predecessors such as Sir Donald Bradman, Greg Chappell and others. Or perhaps, given that in his younger days he was for a time a member of the Mosman Young Liberals, he might turn his talents to this place and provide some leadership to Australia in another way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take great pleasure in supporting the motion today. I do not know where Allan Border will rank in the great batsmen I have seen&mdash;probably not in the best five or six, as a batsman&mdash;but his record as a captain in 93 successive test matches is not only impressive, but leads us to reflect on the circumstances in which he assumed the captaincy. Cricket holds a unique place in Australia. Ever since 1958-59, whenever I have been to test matches at the MCG&mdash;that is, the ones I can remember; I went before then, but cannot remember any of them&mdash;cricket has always been about to finish off. It is always about to disappear as a sport in this country; yet more people play cricket in this country than play football.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sure, people do not go to Sheffield Shield matches and they do not always turn up at test matches. But we only have to look at the statistics of how many people during a day&mdash;even during a Shield match, let alone a test match&mdash;ring up Telecom or the answering service to get a score to find out just how many people are interested in the game. In what national institution other than the great Senate would we be able to listen to the cricket through the sound system and pretend to be listening to question time in the House of Representatives? Where else in the world could that occur but here?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Border started his cricket at a time of a great schism, at a time when World Series Cricket basically divided the Australian cricket world. That was bad enough. But what followed afterwards, I thought, was very sad. Basically, the commentary teams of cricket around this nation were very much aligned with the group that went to World Series Cricket. So people like Allan Border, Kim Hughes, Graham Yallop and others, who actually did not, or were not able to, or were not required to go with that group, were always judged more harshly than anyone else. Australian cricket, from the period of 1980-81 through to 1984, went through some fairly terrible times, which caused Kim Hughes to volunteer the captaincy and to give it away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Border was a reluctant captain at the time. That is a testament to him, because he was loyal to his captain. I think that we in politics understand the meaning of loyalty better than most other citizens. Allan took over the captaincy reluctantly. He then went through some fairly horrible times. I remember when we were defeated in New Zealand, by not the greatest test side in history, and the despair that Allan Border must have felt. It would have been very easy for him just to give it away. But he persisted. It all turned around in 1987, I think, when, as 20 to 1 outsiders, Australia won the World Cup. The interesting thing is that Australia was always hopeless at one-day cricket. It was not that we lacked the ability, but we lacked the thought processes of how to apply ourselves to the one-day game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1987 we have won a lot more one-day games than we have lost. It was all through mental attitude, not through the cricketers who were available. It is very rare that Australia cannot strangle a side if it is batting second. Allan Border was the one who devised those tactics; Allan Border was the one who was able to persist over that period. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague John Faulkner has mentioned a matter that I want to mention, and that is, the regard for Allan Border on the subcontinent. If one reads Mike Coward's book on the tour in about 1987-88, one sees that he stressed it then, and Border has been back since then. The fact is that the best known Australian in India, Pakistan and Sri Lanka is not one R.J. Hawke, it is Allan Border. He is the best known Australian on the subcontinent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many times over the years when England has sent sides to the subcontinent, and how often have we seen the captain of the day be unavailable to tour? Not Allan Border. They are not always easy tours. They are arduous because of transport, et cetera, and different living conditions. Allan Border led side after side to the subcontinent with mixed success, and he has an enormous regard there as the person who was willing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know how many people in the Senate chamber have read the most recent history of Australian cricket. It is quite extensive. It points time and time again to the Australian Board of Control during the 1940s, 1950s, 1960s and 1970s failing in its duty to promote cricket in these countries. If it was not for the intervention of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies in the mid-1950s we may never have gone to the subcontinent. It was his influence that forced the Australian Cricket Board to tour there and to promote cricket. Allan Border has certainly greatly honoured that memory of Sir Robert Gordon Menzies in continuing that process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have met Allan Border only once and that was at the Prime Minister's cricket match when I had to host the lunch. I told a story then about how someone had scored seven runs at Adelaide oval and I asked anyone at the table, including Richie Richardson, how that event could occur. Most people said, `Run two and hit the helmet, penalty, five runs.' But the circumstances were that someone turned the ball to the  leg side, the wicket keeper took off, threw his glove over his head, they ran two, the fieldsman picked up the ball, pinged it back and the dope picked up the glove, grabbed the ball, and penalty, five runs&mdash;seven. Allan Border immediately told me who the cricketer was. He just snapped it straight out who the cricketer was that did it. So he had an enormous knowledge of Australian cricket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman referred to the fact that in his misguided youth Allan Border was a member of the Young Liberals; Senator Chapman then rather whimsically hoped that maybe now that he has retired from cricket he could enter politics. He indeed then at least would have an adversary, I would have to say, but I will not politicise it any further on that particular point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So it is quite appropriate today that we recognise 17 years of test cricket, 10 years as captain and 93-odd successive tests in a row as captain&mdash;as everyone has said, not just for the fact that he scored 11,000 runs, but for the fact that he went through the most arduous possible circumstances of captain, came through that period and then triumphed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It gives me great pleasure to support this motion today which really does salute Allan Border. Allan Border, in anyone's mind, would have to clearly rank as a great Australian and world sportsman and, of course, cricketer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was quite amazed last night when I got home to hear the news that Mr Border had been effectively forced to resign the captaincy by the ACB. As a keen cricket follower, I have been a bit disgusted by&mdash;as Senator Kernot mentioned before&mdash;not only many people within the ACB who have been ambivalent in the last 12 months, but also those members of the media who have really tried to give Mr Border the heave-ho in many of their comments. I think that is a great tragedy because, as has been said before, he someone respected right across this country and across the world for the work that he has done as an Australian, as a cricketer and as a sportsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many comments have been made during this current debate about the statistical evidence of his greatness within his chosen sport. Of those centuries that he made, I think one needs to recall that 15 were hit in test matches that might otherwise have been lost. That is where, as has been said before, the Captain Courageous tag fitted so well to the Allan Border that we know. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> this morning written by Peter McFarline sums up Allan Border's career so well. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He has played more Test matches, 156, than anyone else. He has made more runs, 11,174, than anyone else. He has taken more catches, 156, than anyone else. He has captained Australia 93 times in Test matches, more than anyone else.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He took over as captain at a time when the Australian team could fall no further. He dragged it, almost single-handedly, to . . . the heights, to where only the West Indies could be rated this country's superior. His contribution to the game cannot be measured in normal superlatives. It is reprehensible that his retirement announcement is made in such circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that really does sum it up. He has done so much more than anyone else in cricket that Australia really does owe him a great debt for what he has done for the sport and the way in which he has represented our country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the statistics do not show is the fact that he became captain in 1984 after the sudden resignation of Kim Hughes at a time when such cricketing heroes as Chappell, Marsh and Lillee had departed from the scene. He restored morale and gave leadership during a difficult period when established players quit to make an unauthorised tour of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a cliche, but an essential truth, that cricket is a team game and individual achievement may not make a good captain, but Allan Border's leadership over a decade shows that he will rank as one of Australia's great captains, one who inspired his team mates to give of their best. When one looks at the number of new and young cricketers that Allan Border has been able to nurture and bring forward to the success that they have now reached, it is a further credit to the man. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a cliche that playing the game is more important than winning it. What this can mean is that good leadership can sustain the morale of a team through defeat to ultimate success, and make Australians feel proud of a good fight, whatever the outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fitting that Allan Border's career spans more than one state, having first played for New South Wales and then Queensland. One of the things that I think is amazing is watching his interaction with young children. Let us face it, if Allan Border had been given a dollar for every time he had signed his name in an autograph book he would never have to work another day in his life. He would be a multi-multimillionaire. I think that once again reflects the way in which children have seen him as a real national sporting icon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Above all, I think Allan Border as a man and a sportsman sets a good example to Australians. He was awarded the Order of Australia in 1989, and was Australian of the Year in 1990. That is something that very few cricketers or sportsmen can claim fame for. He has been described as intensely loyal to his team-mates, respectful of his opponents, steady, unflappable and stubborn. He was never a self-conscious celebrity but a down-to-earth and practical Australian. Allan Border has been a professional cricketer in the best sense, who describes his dedication in terms of `you are doing what you enjoy doing'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has enjoyed his job and strained to his upmost to do it well. This is the kind of attitude that we need not only on the sporting field but in the workplace and throughout our daily lives. There is no better tribute than from someone like Dennis Lillee, who said that `When the chips were down, he was always there to be counted'. I will not forget for a long time Mr Border's last appearance at the SCG when the crowd was willing him to go out and get that elusive SCG century. I was watching it from Perth at the time, and to hear that chant of `Border, Border, Border', could only make one will him to do well. That crowd certainly willed him to do well one more time. It was a very moving exercise not only for those present at the ground but for those who watched it on television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to mention the contribution made by Allan's wife, Jane, and his family. He has indeed been a most fortunate man to have a wife and family who have stood beside him throughout the triumphs and the trials of his career, and through all the long separations. Too often in professional sporting careers the families, and in particular the wives or husbands, are overlooked. When debating this motion one must mention Jane and the work that she has put in to make sure that Allan's career has been as successful as it clearly has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleague the shadow minister for youth, sport and recreation, Michael Ronaldson, I too hope that Allan Border is not lost to Australian sport and continues his involvement. We all wish him well in his future life and career and we thank him most sincerely for the essential achievement of leaving Australian cricket in a better state than when he assumed the captaincy. I hope that in many respects he will have the opportunity, maybe one day behind the microphone or the pen, to get back at some of those people who have given him such a hard time. He has done wonders for this country and for the sport of cricket, and indeed for sport in general. </PARA>

It just so happened that AB got in that year, and we all know what he has done since. I will tell honourable senators a little about that particular cricket match. It was against a first XI from my son's school. They were all 17- and 18-year-old boys who felt they knew a fair bit about cricket. David Hourn was the other player whom we selected that year. David Hourn did not quite make it, but he is still one of the characters of cricket and he also has made a great contribution to the game. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Border showed that he was a real professional at that particular stage because he showed how an innings could be built. He got 100-odd runs and did not hit any fours or sixes until he got into the sixties. It was quite interesting because one of my friends who was batting with AB&mdash;just an ordinary cricketer like myself&mdash;ran himself out after a while because he could not handle all the sharp singles that Allan Border was running. Allan Border taught those kids what had to be done to become a world-class cricketer, and this showed up in all the things that he did after that. Being a left-hander also endears him to my heart because it is the best side of the bat to stand, as he proved over and over again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian national report on population for the United Nations International Conference on Population and Development refers to issues which are fundamental to multiculturalism in Australia including the importance of access to English language services by people from non-English speaking backgrounds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the heading of `Integration and Multiculturalism', the report talks about the provision of English language tuition under settlement programs and services. It also says English language courses are part of the services which are critical to the needs of immigrants in realising the same rights as longstanding residents and participating fully in the economic and social life of the country. Those observations are particularly critical. In all my consultations around Australia I find that that is one of the factors which people from ethnic communities believe is not being addressed adequately by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the report raises the important issue that some people in the community consider that 510 hours granted to migrants under the adult migrant English program are insufficient to get a proper grasp of the English language. In addition, the criticism has always been, and continues to be, that there is inadequate opportunity to learn conversational English. While people might be taught to recognise one word from another, and some have a better grounding and background to learn more easily than others, there are major problems in conversational English. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Job-related English tuition is now delivered through the labour market programs. But it is the adult migrant English program which takes care of incoming migrants who have been assessed as not having functional English. In those consultations around Australia, to which I referred earlier, the message is very much the same. The message is that 510 hours of English tuition is not enough. I cannot emphasise that enough because that is having a huge impact on the ability of those communities to be able to get in there and feel part of Australia so that individuals can access jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently at a meeting with senior members of Western Australia's Vietnamese community the issue of the unacceptably high rate of unemployment among Vietnamese people in Australia was raised. The Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show that 16.9 per cent of the Vietnamese community in Australia are long-term unemployed. Once again, that community cites the lack of English as directly linked to that problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report says a major goal of Australia's multicultural policies is to improve the competitiveness and productivity of the economy through the proper management and utilisation of diverse work force skills. The fact is, often through no fault of their own, many migrants are joining the ranks of the unemployed and long-term unemployed. Their diverse skills are often not being utilised because they do not have adequate command of the English language. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of those people have been brought to Australia because of their abilities, background and expertise in any given field. It is important for Australia to ensure that they be allowed to contribute the expertise that they have brought with them to Australia. An ABS profile on Australia's long-term unemployed showed that nearly half of those ethnic people who were unemployed were long-term unemployed. The long-term unemployment rate for people from non-English speaking backgrounds is double that of people born in Australia and those from English speaking background countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is commonly accepted that the lack of familiarity with English as a spoken and written language is one of the main influences on whether migrants find jobs. It is nothing short of shameful that, under the past 10 years of federal Labor government, migrants from non-English speaking countries have consistently had the highest long-term unemployment rates. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 10 years of government, last year the then Minister for Employment, Education and Training, Mr Beazley, announced that his government was going to remove some of the additional barriers faced by migrant job seekers by setting up a network of migrant liaison offices to act as a link between the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Commonwealth Employment Service and ethnic communities. While this is commendable, even if it is 10 years late, I make the point that the ethnic communities are still saying there is a need to look at increasing the number of hours of English tuition given to migrants in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has to make the solution of the problem of ethnic unemployment one of its most important priorities. If it is to do this, it must fully review the hours of English training available to migrants in and outside the workplace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In continuation of my speech, I should note that in the time that has elapsed since we last addressed this motion by Senator Short the federal budget has come down and we see that there has been an increase of funding to the Vietnam veterans for their health and care. Without doubt, the government has made this move after realising the very callous and uncaring actions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in his visit to Vietnam. The government's action was obviously influenced by the great political damage caused by his actions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure it is appreciated by the veterans, but whatever their appreciation might be it simply cannot eliminate the perception of absolute disregard of the veterans by the Prime Minister when he was in Vietnam. I want to make it quite clear that the Prime Minister's decision not to recognise the veterans distinctly lacked an understanding of Australian history because Gallipoli has never been celebrated as a victory. Indeed, Gallipoli was a political and wartime disaster, not dissimilar to the Vietnam experience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Australians recognise the valour of our service men. We uplift our service men and we celebrate their return home. We recognise their duty to their country of those who did not return home. Australians have had this long tradition since Gallipoli and it is not going to end with Vietnam. Regardless of the political turmoil that surrounded the Vietnam War, Australians take a separate view towards their service men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a distinct failure of perception of the Australian character by the Prime Minister, in spite of the pretty weak defence offered by this government. This seems to be very much a singular attitude by the Prime Minister. He failed to understand that Australian characteristic and was so engrossed in the politics of the day that he was willing to sacrifice the respect and dignity of our service men and women and, in particular, the families of those service men and women who did not come home from Vietnam. The Prime Minister sacrificed them for political expediency and favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to return to a point I made last week regarding Senator Gareth Evans's comments in defence of the Prime Minister's actions. Senator Evans asked what would be the point of recognising the actions of Australians in Vietnam when there were no service men or women buried in that country. We do not have the graves in Vietnam that we have on the Western Front, in the New Guinea highlands or on the Thailand-Burma railway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out to Senator Evans, that is a pretty weak defence because there are known to be six Australian service men missing from that war. In the week that has elapsed I was able to collect their names. I recall a very distinct incident. The opening of the Vietnam memorial in Canberra some 18 months ago was a most significant event in this country. Anyone who turned up that day and in the weeks after could see that on the outside of that memorial there are some granite stones recognising the very men who did not return home. Those men get a significant recognition at that Vietnam War memorial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were more crowds gathered around those particular plaques than at the main memorial. Beside Richard Harold John Parker's plaque was a wreath of flowers from those who served with him. That wreath carried a most touching comment saying: `At last, Richard, we have brought you home.' That is the individual significance that Australians give to their service men and women. That is simply the Anzac tradition, a tradition which was forgotten by the Prime Minister when he went to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to read out the names of those six missing servicemen who undoubtedly lie in the soil of Vietnam. Their names are Richard Harold John Parker, Peter Raymond Gillson, Michael Patrick Herbert, Robert Charles Carver, John Francis Gillespie and David John Elkington Fisher. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not intending to participate in this debate, but I was provoked by the contribution made by the Foreign Minister, Senator Gareth Evans, last week. I must say that my colleague Senator Short moved a sensible and necessary motion after the embarrassing performance of our Prime Minister, Mr Keating, during his recent visit to Vietnam. The Prime Minister found it politically convenient to overlook the sacrifice of Australian service men and women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was listening to Senator Evans's speech in my room last week and his attempted defence of the Prime Minister was appalling. In fact, I had to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to check that in fact Senator Evans had said what I understood him to have said. I found it unbelievable to hear the foreign minister of this country indicate that we are giving aid to redress what he or his government regards as shame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hear Senator Evans go on and say that we as Australians should accept at least some of the responsibility for the current state of poverty in Vietnam&mdash;and I acknowledge it is one of the poorest countries in the world&mdash;I also found unbelievable. He should recognise more than most that the real problem which has faced Vietnam&mdash;the lack of development and the suffering that has resulted from the lack of development&mdash;does not flow from the war; it flows from the system of government which was installed after the war. As we have seen all over the world, governments based on the communist model do not produce the wealth that is necessary to achieve reasonable standards of living for their people, let alone give them through the political system the freedoms that every man and woman internationally is entitled to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have been much happier if Senator Evans last week had recognised that to be a fact rather than attributed blame to his country, Australia&mdash;a country that he has a particular responsibility to represent in a leadership role in international fora. I have never heard before an Australian foreign minister say that we are giving aid to a country to help overcome its poverty because we feel a shame. I was embarrassed to hear that. I want to put it on the record that we on this side of the chamber were appalled that that might be the attitude of the Australian foreign minister and presumably also the attitude of his Prime Minister, because the minister seems always to respond to Mr Keating's sentiment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What it demonstrates is that Vietnam badly needs economic and political reform, and that is what Mr Keating could have been constructively urging during his recent visit. I acknowledge that there has been some economic reform, and there has been some small improvement in the standard of living of the Vietnamese people as a result of that. Now that the period of isolation has come to an end&mdash;and I must say to Senator Evans that Mr Keating even attributes that in part to us&mdash;hopefully there will be the opportunity for even greater economic development as international capital flows into Vietnam and it becomes more integrally involved in the international trading world. That, and the potential material wealth that flows from it, will benefit Vietnam and the Vietnamese people, and I am pleased that that is going to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber, however, hold the strong view that maximising economic benefit will not take just economic reform but political reform as well. Until people have the sorts of freedoms that are taken for granted in most places of the world these days, they will not maximise the economic opportunities, let alone their political opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it clear that we on this side of the chamber support the building of new foundations with Vietnam, but we will still press Vietnam to comply with the minimum standards of human rights as set out in the international covenant. That is something that we do as citizens of the international community. There are minimum standards that the world community as a whole has accepted and it is our responsibility to press those who abuse those standards to comply. I regret that Mr Keating and Senator Evans seem to be somewhat shy these days in pursuing these matters when they are within our own region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to table a copy of the most recent Amnesty International report on Vietnam that I have been able to get, and also the United States' state department's annual report on human rights as it relates to Vietnam. Also, I would like to table the latest material I have been able to get on the assessment by Asia Watch on human rights in Vietnam.

Nor was it the view of the thousands of Vietnamese who were forced to flee their country as a result of the conflict. Those Vietnamese, many thousands of whom now live in Australia and have become very good Australian citizens, certainly did not feel liberated by the victory of the North Vietnamese. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend Senator Short for reminding Mr Keating and the foreign minister, Senator Evans, that Labor treated our returned service-men from that war appallingly.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, as I say, I think this motion really seeks to do nothing but further politicise something that we ought not to be politicising, particularly when it was a conservative government that saw people go to Vietnam and it was a Labor government that finally acknowledged both the people who lost their lives and those who returned. I think it is sad day when we continue with these sorts of motions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to oppose the motion. I think this is a very unnecessary motion. It is more of a political stunt. Of course, we are always used to political stunts in politics, but I think this is unnecessary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other government senators, including Senator Murphy, have pointed out the background and the historical experience of Australia in the Vietnam War. In speaking to oppose the motion, I want to point out a couple of facts about the issue of human rights in Vietnam, which issue is being thrown around with gay abandon by those on the other side of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have visited Vietnam on four or five occasions since 1988, sometimes as a private visitor and sometimes as a member of an official parliamentary delegation. Every time I have visited Vietnam, I have taken the opportunity to raise with the appropriate officials, at whatever level, issues about human rights, political freedom and political democracy in their country&mdash;or the lack of them, as I have seen it. I did that when I was a member of a delegation. I was on a parliamentary delegation from this parliament that visited Vietnam in the beginning of 1989. Senator McGauran is in the chamber. One of the members of that delegation was his brother, a member of another place. We raised human rights issues with the Vietnamese&mdash;issues of political conscience, political discussion, democracy and the need for change in the way the Vietnamese government ran its country, as we saw it. On my private visits I have also raised those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the responses from the Vietnamese government was a very simple and well-put line: between 1965 and 1975, when the Americans were dropping more bombs on Vietnam than were dropped in total during the Second World War by the allies, where was our concern about the human rights of the literally millions of Vietnamese civilians&mdash;including women and children&mdash;who were being killed by that massive bombing attack? I think that has to be acknowledged. A lot of people in Vietnam, even if they may have been supportive of the Vietnamese effort in the civil war, were certainly innocent bystanders and were killed by the bombing of that country. I think that is an argument that cannot be ignored. Even though I acknowledge that point, I would always raise&mdash;and I think others have&mdash;the need to look to the future of Vietnam, which, for the country's own wellbeing, deserves to have a system of government in which the individual is protected from arbitrary arrest and arbitrary invasion by the government. </PARA>

That report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A review of Australia's efforts to promote and protect human rights</EMPHASIS>, came down in December 1992. I was chair of that subcommittee, just as I was chair of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. A section in that report, going for three or four pages, deals with human rights abuses in Vietnam, based on information that was given to the subcommittee by ex-Vietnamese citizens now living in Australia. The subcommittee members, irrespective of whether they were Labor, Liberal, Democrat or Green, accepted those submissions and, as a result, made a recommendation to the Australian government that we encourage it to raise particular cases of human rights abuses with the Vietnamese government. That is in recommendation 7.37 of this report.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.34<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arbitrary and openended nature of the law is at the heart of the human rights abuses in Vietnam. Dr Nguyen Trieu Dan, a Vietnamese lawyer trained in France, told the Committee of vague and general crimes such as `crimes against the people', `offences against national security' and `being counter-revolutionary'. He quoted, among others, the cases of the journalist Tran Nhon Co arrested in 1977, accused of travelling to another province without authorisation and held without trial since, or Dr Ton That Sang, sentenced to thirteen years imprisonment for passing information heard on BBC and VOA broadcasts.(25) The government of Vietnam has used detention without trial, trials of short duration (one or two days), no legal counsel of choice and harsh sentences to persecute political opposition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.35<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reforms of the Criminal Code in 1986 and the Criminal Procedure Code in 1989 were aimed at guaranteeing the rights of citizens and, no doubt, at improving Vietnam's human rights reputation. The government claimed that by 1988 all political prisoners detained in re-education camps without trial had been either sentenced or released. Dr Nguyen Trieu Dan believed the re-education camps still operated and still contained large numbers of people.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">According to the February 1990 Amnesty International report, `in each of Vietnam's 40 provinces there is at least one main re-education camp divided into several sub camps'. Even if we were to understand the term several as meaning only 3 sub camps, then there are 120 sub camps in the 40 provinces. As one sub camp (here again I quote the Amnesty International report) `has the capacity to hold 1,000 prisoners', if all 120 sub camps were full, there would be 120,000 detainees. If they were only half full, that would still mean 60,000 prisoners, even at a quarter full, the figure still reaches 30,000.(26)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.36<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, Dr Dan drew to the Committee's attention a system of black listing of families.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The reason I wanted to incorporate those pages is to show the Senate that the Labor Party, the Labor government, has been consistent in raising human rights abuses in Vietnam and that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has reported to this parliament previously on many occasions that we have raised, through diplomatic channels, in private and in public, our concern about human rights abuses in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Gareth Evans points out, we do this without fear or favour as a government. We have raised the issue of human rights abuses by governments that some people may term as being on the left&mdash;one-party communist governments&mdash;and by one-party governments or semi-fascist governments on the right. We raise these issues without fear or favour. Because we do it without fear or favour, this government has credibility around the world in being able to raise human rights abuses in any country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In discussions with the Vietnamese, when they made the point about the human rights abuses of their people when they were being bombed and what we did vis-a-vis the Americans who were dropping the bombs, I had to admit that we were not the government of Australia until the very end of the Vietnam War, when the Labor government immediately withdrew our troops after it was elected in 1972. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also pointed out to the Vietnamese that we have already taken up human rights issues with the American government over the use of capital punishment in the United States because we, as a government, do not support the use of capital punishment in any circumstance. We do make representations around the world, irrespective of government&mdash;even to a close ally like the United States, where we believe humans rights are being transgressed in the use of capital punishment. I think the Americans are a little surprised that we took that human rights view. I think the Vietnamese were a little surprised as well that we would raise with the Americans those issues as human rights issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That proves we do it without fear or favour. We have raised it with Vietnam, as we have raised it with many other countries. Therefore, the content of this motion is a political stunt, as I have said, and is self-serving. The Prime Minister, in visiting Vietnam, did raise on the public record our concern about human rights, as he has done in raising human rights issues and our concern about the situation in East Timor when he visited Indonesia, and as he has raised our concern about the situation in many other countries. Also, our foreign minister has always put that on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extraordinary economic transformation taking place in Vietnam which I have observed in my visits going back to 1989 will lead, in my view, to an improvement in the political situation in the country. It will lead to a more pluralistic, open society. Even though the Vietnamese government&mdash;the party&mdash;is still committed to the supremacy of the Communist Party of Vietnam, to the view that it has the sole right to form the government, the economic transformation will change that view, because there cannot be an open, free-market and developing economy, based on a dynamic outcome, while there is still a one-party state trying to run everything from the central level. The Communist Party of Vietnam is having to tackle that problem, just as the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China is trying to deal with that difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Prime Minister acted in absolutely appropriate terms and in a very appropriate way when he visited Vietnam. To say that he offended the 50,000 Australian soldiers who were in Vietnam during our participation in that war in the 1960s and early 1970s is really offensive both to the Prime Minister and to his position. As he pointed out, there are actually no war graves, no war cemetery, in Vietnam. All the Australian soldiers who were, unfortunately, killed were brought home and buried in Australia, unlike what occurred in Thailand, where there is a war cemetery containing the graves of those soldiers who died on the Burma Railway. There is a war cemetery there where an appropriate ceremony can always take place. The Prime Minister did do that. That is not the case in Vietnam. In that war, we brought home those who lost their lives and buried them in Australia in an appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the visit I made to Vietnam in 1989, one of the issues that our delegation raised on behalf of the Australian  servicemen who served there was the issue of the return of the cross of Long Tan to Australia&mdash;the cross commemorating the famous battle of Long Tan where 15 or 16 Australians lost their lives. The Australian service people, before they left Vietnam, erected a cross on that site as a memorial to those who died. It has been discovered since then that the cross has been removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we were there, we asked whether we could see the cross and whether it could be returned to Australia. We discovered the original cross lying in a village war museum. But the Vietnamese said they wanted that cross to stay in their country. In discussions I had with Vietnamese officials, including the Chairman of the Vietnamese National Assembly when he visited this country a year later, it was pointed out that the cross is a memento of the war for the local people in the province. They do not want it returned to Australia. They want to keep it as a memorial also to the lives lost on the Vietnamese side. The chairman himself may have been quite sympathetic to the cross being returned to Australia, but he said that the local people had very strong feelings about it and that they had to be taken into consideration. I would imagine all of us could understand that, now that we look back more dispassionately at that situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those remarks to point out that there is no appropriate place where the Prime Minister of Australia could have participated in a ceremony, as he did in Thailand at a Commonwealth war grave. That is a point he made at the time. The contribution that was made in that war by the Vietnam veterans, who went to Vietnam through no fault of their own&mdash;they were sent by the government of the day to carry out that government's polices&mdash;has always been acknowledged. Our party has never criticised the soldiers who participated in the Vietnam War, because they were sent to carry out the policies of the government of the day. We accept that. Our government participated in establishing the Vietnam War memorial in Canberra. The former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, established the famous commemorative march that took place a few years ago in Sydney to pay tribute to the contribution of the Australian veterans from Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Short's motion is quite self-serving and ought to be recognised as a political stunt that does Australia's standing no good. It politicises, in an unfortunate way, the contribution of Australian soldiers who were carrying out the orders of the elected government of the day by being involved in Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Senate to oppose this motion and to recognise that the relationship between our country and Vietnam is a sound one, but one in which we are not obsequious to the Vietnamese government about the issue of human rights. This government has raised the issue consistently with the Vietnamese government. This parliament has raised it in a bipartisan way. I think the motion is unfortunate and intemperate and would do human rights in Vietnam no good. It would do the relationship between both our countries no good. In that relationship, we have always acknowledged the important role that we play in raising human rights in Vietnam and in other countries. </PARA>

<PARA>That was perfectly clear from the reactions that one read and heard after this matter blew up. I am concerned about the delay in giving due recognition to the service to Australia of those 50,000 soldiers who fought in Vietnam. An official gesture of due recognition was not given until the fifth day of the Prime Minister's visit to Vietnam. I do not know whether that was because of poor advice given by the Prime Minister's advisers, departmental or otherwise. It is not for me to make a judgment on that. I simply regret that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Prime Minister did make an official gesture of due recognition prior to his leaving Vietnam. Therefore, I do not think it is appropriate for the Senate to condemn the Prime Minister. I do not think it is appropriate for a couple of reasons. One of the reasons is that it might send a negative message to Vietnam. After all, the Prime Minister did make an official gesture of due recognition. How that came about is another question, but he did do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe we need to note what occurred, and to that extent agree with Senator Short. I foreshadow an amendment to delete paragraphs (a) and (b) of the motion and insert in lieu thereof the following:</PARA>

<PARA>The government cannot deny the fact that a wide number of Australians were offended. It is important to recognise that and to ensure that sort of thing does not occur again. I cannot envisage where it could occur, but such a failure by a leader of this country to give priority to a very important obligation must not occur again. I think the statesmanlike approach is to simply express deep regret at the delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who is responsible for the delay? Well, I suppose ultimately the Prime Minister is responsible. But it would be interesting to see and hear what sort of advice he was given. The Senate can express regret. The message goes to whoever gave him the advice.

In the end, the Prime Minister on behalf of Australia gave an official gesture of due recognition to</PARA>

We are yet to hear that officially in this chamber, but if some of those recommendations have been rejected, the government deserves support in that regard.

I am rather concerned that we might go along with China in the way that the United States of America did. I am reading a very interesting book by Dr Steven Mosher entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">China misperceived: American illusions and Chinese reality</EMPHASIS>. It gives a very humorous account of the visit of Nixon to China and the earlier visit of Henry Kissinger, who paved the way for President Nixon's visit to China. There was a buttering up of the American public before the visit and the White House had virtually decreed that there was to be no mention of the word `communist'. The former chairman of the communist party, Mao Tse Tung, the premier of communist China, Chou En-lai, and so on, were to be referred to as merely as Chairman Mao and Premier Chou. That was the first thing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second was to ensure that Chou En-lai was to be regarded as an urbane, witty, very intelligent character when America believed, with a great deal of justification, that Mao Tse Tung's cultural revolution and before that the Great Leap Forward, were nothing more or less than the acts of barbarians.

Had the world stood up strongly at that time, instead of playing the China card as Nixon did, there may well have been a bigger difference in China today than we have seen thus far. I am concerned also, as is Senator Short, that there has been an official invitation to Do Muoi, who is not the Prime Minister of Vietnam but the head of the Vietnamese Communist Party. It has been stated that he is the mover and shaker of things in Vietnam. That may be so.

I am not saying that he necessarily was involved in that decision. It is under his name&mdash;but I suppose that is to be expected as he is the secretary-general of the party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;In closing this debate I do not want to take the Senate's time unduly, but some statements have been made by members of the government during the debate, notably by Senator Gareth Evans and Senator Loosley, that cannot be let go unanswered. Senator Hill has already responded to several of them. I congratulate him and thank him for his excellent contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will first deal with the quite appalling contribution of Senator Evans who, I remind the Senate, is a no lesser figure than Australia's Minister for Foreign Affairs, which makes him this nation's senior representative of our international interests and through whom our reputation as a nation is judged by other nations. As well, Senator Evans aspires to the position of Secretary-General of the United Nations. I have to say that if any of those people around the world who choose the UN Secretary-General read Senator Evans's contribution last week to this debate, they would surely scratch him off their list of possible candidates once and for all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I never thought that I would ever hear the foreign minister of my country demean himself and his country as Senator Gareth Evans did last week. Senator Evans said, amongst other things, that Australia contributed very much in the 1960s and 1970s to what he described as `the destruction of Vietnam and its social environment'. He went on to say that we contributed very much `to the economic environment of grinding poverty which has continued for so long'. He also said that his generation, his government, `should be taking the kind of steps if we are to redress some of that shame'&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>some of that `shame'&mdash;`and not to contribute any further to the destruction of the country'; that is, Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley's contribution to the debate ran along similar lines. He spoke of Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War as `wrong in moral terms, political terms and in terms of our relationship with the region'. He spoke of `the shameful record of Australian involvement in the Vietnamese War', and on and on he went. To me it was a shameful, un-Australian, anti-American monologue from what used to be called the New Left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senator Loosley is the same Senator Loosley who Senator Evans has chosen to lead an official so-called consultative delegation to Vietnam in two months time. That delegation was originally to be called a human rights delegation. That title&mdash;which has been pointed out today, including by Senator Harradine most recently&mdash;has now been dropped, apparently as a result of pressure from the Vietnamese government on Senator Evans and on Prime Minister Keating. It is now to have the innocuous, meaningless, wimpish title of consultative delegation. To what extent human rights issues will be discussed at all, or the human rights situation in Vietnam examined in any detail at all, remains clouded in doubt. But judging by the apologist remarks from Senator Evans and Senator Loosley in this debate, one can only have the gravest doubts about the delegation's activities in this respect. I hope I am wrong; but only time will tell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did not want to reopen the debate on Australia's participation in the Vietnam War when I gave notice of the motion that is the subject of this debate. I said that quite specifically in my opening remarks last week. But Senator Evans and Senator Loosley did reopen the debate in the most appalling, abject, apologist way that I have already discussed in part. As an Australian, I must say that I was ashamed and I was disgusted by their words. Having heard their craven apologias to the communist regime in Hanoi, I now have no doubts that the media reports during Mr Keating's recent visit that he had apologised to the Vietnamese communist government for Australia's involvement in the Vietnam War were well based. If that is so, I say to the Senate that that is a disgrace and a sell-out of our nation. What action could be more un-Australian than that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The foreign minister and Senator Loosley have once again attempted the age old tactic of the Left: ignore the facts, ignore the context of the times, and rewrite the history no matter what the cost to truth, to integrity and to morality. The fundamental opening fact that they deliberately choose to ignore, or are too ideologically blind to see, is that Australia's intervention in Vietnam was part of a concerted effort by many nations assisting the South Vietnamese people. The allied effort was designed to prevent communist North Vietnam imposing a Stalinist dictatorship on the south, and using that springboard to capture the whole of Indochina. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of record that immediately after North Vietnamese Army units occupied Saigon in 1975, communist regimes were installed in both Laos and Cambodia. It is also a matter of record, as former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser pointed out so clearly on last night's ABC <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> program, that the member nations of the then still new and fragile ASEAN were strong supporters of the allied action in Vietnam and greatly feared the fall of South Vietnam to the communists because of the consequences that it could have for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Vietnam War it was frequently said that Australia was involved in a civil war. That was the line propagated by Hanoi and its allies in Australia, and it was believed by many people who did not know better. Years after the war ended, some of the communists told the truth. In an interview with French television in 1983, which was reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 28 February of that year, General Vo Bam of the North Vietnamese Army declared that the decision to unleash the war in the south was taken in 1959 by a communist party plenum. That, I point out to the Senate, was a year before the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam was established. The aim, said General Bam, was `to reunite the country'. So much for the myth that the NLF was a genuine nationalist movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans and Senator Loosley spoke proudly of their involvement in the anti-Vietnam War demonstrations in the 1960s and the 1970s. Their ideological blinkers have remained firmly in place ever since. Indeed, to my knowledge, no significant member of the Australian Left has ever felt any need to reassess in any way their interpretation of Hanoi's aims or the nature of North Vietnamese totalitarianism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not everyone from the Left who marched in those moratoriums has remained so blind. Some of the important leaders of the New Left movement have come to similar conclusions to those that were stated bluntly and frankly by General Bam. David Horowitz is one in particular. He was no little figure in the New Left movement. Indeed, he was co-founder and co-editor of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ramparts</EMPHASIS>, the flagship publication of the New Left in the 1960s. As a graduate student at the University of California, Berkeley, he organised the first protests against American intervention in Vietnam. In an interview in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Human Events</EMPHASIS> in 1985, 10 years after the fall of Saigon to the communists, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Vietnam itself, the war's aftermath showed beyond any doubt the struggle there was not ultimately to achieve or prevent self-determination but&mdash;as various Presidents said, and we denied&mdash;a communist conquest of the south.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to add:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, whose cause we supported&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the cause the New Left supported&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">no longer exists. Its leaders are dead, in detention camps under house arrest, in exile, powerless.</PARA>
<PARA>Horowitz went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">America left Vietnam 10 years ago, but today Hanoi's army is the fourth largest in the world and Vietnam has emerged as a Soviet satellite and imperialist aggressor in its own right, subverting the independence of Laos, invading and colonising Laos.</PARA>
<PARA>That was 10 years after the end of the Vietnam War. Denis Warner, one of Australia's most perceptive commentators on foreign affairs, wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Melbourne Herald</EMPHASIS> in 1985&mdash;again, 10 years after the war&mdash;of academic research that indicated that `at least 65,000 Vietnamese were executed in South Vietnam for political reasons between 1975 and 1983'. In the years after the fall of Saigon, it has been estimated that over one million Vietnamese were imprisoned in communist re-education camps, which were similar to the POW camps in which Australians were imprisoned after the fall of Singapore in 1942. An unknown number of Vietnamese prisoners perished of starvation, torture or overwork. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After 1975, another million or more fled their country in leaking boats in an effort to escape the Marxist paradise which Ho Chi Minh and others had prepared for them. An indeterminate number perished in the South China Sea, and most of those who survived have been resettled in democratic nations such as Australia, Canada and the United States. Let me quote again from David Horowitz&mdash;writing in 1987 with another key 1960s figure of the New Left, Peter Collier. They wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After America's defeat in Vietnam the New Left was presented with a balance sheet showing the consequences of its politics. New Left orthodoxy had scorned the idea that the war was at least partly about Soviet expansion, but soon after the American pullout, the Soviets were in Da Nang and Camh Ranh Bay and had secured the rights to exploit the resources of Indochina in unmistakably imperial style. Other things we had claimed were impossible were also now happening with dizzying velocity. Far from being liberated, South Vietnam was occupied by its former "ally" in the North. Large numbers of "indigenous" revolutionaries we had supported were in "political" re-education camps set up by Hanoi, or taking their chances on the open seas with hundreds of thousands of other Vietnamese fleeing the revolution in flimsy boats. In Cambodia two million peasants were dead, slaughtered by the Communist Khmer Rouge proteges of Hanoi and the beneficiaries of the New Lefts "solidarity". It was a daunting lesson: more people had been killed in three years of a Communist peace than in thirteen years of American war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Evans dismissed all this in his typical imperial, arrogant, ideological way. If one listened to him last week one would think that this never happened. One would think that it was the allies in Vietnam that were to blame for all the suffering of the Vietnamese people at that time. As I said earlier, he claimed specifically that Australia had contributed, to use his words, `very much to the economic environment of grinding poverty which has continued for so long.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as Australia, the grinding poverty, according to Senator Evans, is due to the Vietnamese government being denied access to finance through the international financial institutions, or `any form of assistance from the United States, Japan and other countries following the United States leadership.' That is another glimpse of the real Gareth Evans, the unreconstructed anti-American Evans of old, who tries desperately to cloak his ideological hang-ups behind a superficial mask of statesmanship. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be some of that (-ie the lack of access to finance, and presumably, the grinding poverty&mdash;) was brought on Vietnam's own head by some of the policy decisions it took during that period&mdash;in particular the invasion of Cambodia . . .</PARA>
<PARA>`It may be,' he said; it certainly was. What an apologia from this minister! I wonder whether we will ever hear a recognition from Senator Evans, Senator Loosley and their ilk that the grinding poverty of the Vietnamese people, the hardships they have endured and that millions continue to endure, might be due to the facts that in the 19 years since South Vietnam was destroyed, not one free and fair election has been held in Vietnam, freedom of the press is unknown, churches are government-controlled or suppressed, and human rights are trampled underfoot, often brutally. I will not be holding my breath in expectation of hearing any of that from Senators Evans and Loosley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do Senator Evans or Senator Loosley seriously believe that the Vietnamese people, 19 years after the communist victory, are better off than they would have been if the allies had been successful in assisting South Vietnam to resist communist domination? One could easily get the impression, listening to their contributions to this debate, that they do. I doubt whether many Vietnamese would agree with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not for one moment suggesting that we should live in the past, that we should let the events of the past dictate our actions in the future. I believe strongly that it is in the interests of both the Australian and the Vietnamese peoples that there be growing economic and commercial relations between our two countries. But I believe also that Australia should do all in its power to press for the end of the continuing abuse of human rights in Vietnam. This abuse will act to limit the achievement of the potential of our relationship with Vietnam so long as it continues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as we should not live in the past, nor should we ignore or forget the past, or fail to recognise the reality of the present non-democratic and poverty stricken situation that still exists in Vietnam, where the government continues to violate fundamental human rights, after 19 years of communist rule in the South and for much longer in the North. If we seek to ignore the past, then we cannot learn from it, and we put at risk the future. The dangers are even greater if, in addition to attempting to ignore the past, we consciously distort it and attempt to re-write history, as Senator Evans and Senator Loosley have in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, Prime Minister Keating's decision during his recent visit to announce such a major increase in Australian aid to Vietnam raised many questions to which answers have not yet been supplied. There is much understandable concern within the Vietnamese-Australian community, and beyond, that this very large program has been announced without any valid justification, and without any apparent attempt to use it as a lever to achieve any improvement in the human rights situation in Vietnam. Indeed, if anything, there appears to have been an intensifying of human rights abuses of political prisoners, prisoners of conscience and religious leaders since then.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This makes Senator Evans's advice to the Senate last week about the delegation to visit Vietnam in July even more significant. It is an important development, even if belated. I am surprised that Senator Evans chose this low key way to announce it. It is not like him to hide his light under a bushel. I wonder if it confirms the fears I have expressed earlier, as have others, about what the delegation might achieve, particularly on human rights issues. These fears are fully shared by the Vietnamese-Australian community. I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a press release on this matter and on Australia's huge new aid package to Vietnam that was issued by the Vietnamese community in Australia on 6 May. </PARA>

As so many have said, it is more of a gamble than a plan: a gamble that business will invest at a record rate, up to 14 1/2 per cent from what is now a record low rate of just one per cent; a gamble that interest rates will not rise when they are already starting to rise&mdash;and we remind the government again of that which it always seems to forget, that real interest rates in this country are already high; a gamble that inflation will be contained, even though the budget papers forecast an upward trend; a gamble that the current account will not blow out again, although we already have a deficit this year of some $17 billion and the forecast for the budget year takes it up to $18 billion; a gamble that the economy will grow at a record rate and that the growth will be sustained through the balance of this decade; a gamble that we will not return to the boom-bust cycle of the past; and perhaps the greatest gamble of all, that new, real jobs will be created out of an expanding economy to address the greatest tragedy of the Keating government, of Mr Keating's personal hand on the tiller, that is, nearly a million Australians unemployed and many more thousands underemployed or having given up looking for work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no surprise that, when pressed yesterday, Mr Willis hesitated on the business growth projections because his own department, as we found in question time yesterday, has refused to put its reputation on the line on Mr Willis's business growth figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also no surprise that he hesitated on the job growth projections. Already we have had figures from this government ranging from an expectation of 1.4 million jobs through to 2 million jobs&mdash;a 40 per cent difference between ministers over a few days. It is possible for the government to estimate the temporary jobs that can be created, in effect, purchased by its white paper, its new training scheme; but in relation to real jobs, sustainable jobs, ongoing jobs, all the government can really do, and all it really does, is just hope. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important at the outset to understand that this is the first budget drawn in consultation with the minor parties of this parliament, and in particular the Australian Democrats. They joined with their soul mates, the Australian Labor Party, in drawing a framework for this budget that they, the Democrats, could accept. They must remember that they are a party to all the shortcomings of this document. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is too late for the Democrats to squeal. They have shown their colours. They have clearly identified themselves as in Labor's camp&mdash;referred to fondly by some of my colleagues as the fifth faction of Labor; but of course in doing so the Democrats let down those of their supporters who still believed that they were really independent. It is now too late&mdash;the Democrats are clearly in bed with Labor and they must also be branded with the shortcomings of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have locked themselves into Mr Keating's package. As he said to us some time ago, he wanted the job of Prime Minister because he would then have his fingers in all the policy pies. You will remember, Mr President, that what we were expecting, what we had been told we were going to get was a separate regional statement&mdash;something that would address the major difficulties that are being faced in regional Australia under Labor: the loss of jobs; the loss of opportunity; and the run-down of infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kelty was one of those who wrote the paper. I do not often quote Mr Kelty but he put it in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean we're talking about a country which is growing. In order to grow you've got to have infrastructure. All we've done is wound down infrastructure investment in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about regional Australia. He was saying that the Labor government has to address a constant wind down of infrastructure, which is the basis of a competitive economy and therefore jobs out in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, we were expecting a separate industry statement because industry policies had been very much the Button plans. Senator Button had gone, his plans had served their time, the government had not developed a new industry agenda at the time of the last election, as we all knew&mdash;we expected that to come out of a separate policy document. Of course, Labor went through the embarrassment of Mr Griffiths and the sandwich shop affair and was unable to produce the promised industry statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we were told that we were going to get a new agenda, new hope for the almost 400,000 long-term and very long-term unemployed in this country&mdash;the highest figure since records have been kept. And they were certainly expecting more than just another training scheme. But rather than have these statements delivered by others, Mr Keating joined them together in his typical way, wanting to outbid even Chifley with a multi-billion dollar trainee scheme, which he has labelled falsely but grandly a jobs compact. A jobs compact gives the impression that there is something that will be ongoing&mdash;that the out of work Australian, having made his part of the compact, can expect something that is ongoing. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, Mr Keating, as he so often does, raises unreal expectations, only to disappoint again in the future. It left Mr Willis with little. All he could really do on budget night was announce the funding base for this new expenditure, and that we now know is the gamble on growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that Mr Keating's record gives no basis for confidence. When the budget is a gamble and the bet is on Mr Keating's judgment, one is entitled to have little confidence in the outcome. We must always remember that this is the same Mr Keating who once said the J-curve would be our `export salvation'. That is a quote. When it did not work, what did he say? He then said, `It is not that the J-curve effect is not there; it's being asked to do too much.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is absolute nonsense. It is the same Mr Keating who said that he was holding the levers of power `in comfort' and then gave us the worst recession in 60 years. It is the same Mr Keating who said in 1985, `The government is not going to tolerate any section of the community destroying the prosperity of the Australian economy.' A few years later he came back to us and said, `This is the recession Australia had to have.' What was it that destroyed the prosperity of the community? It was government policy itself. It is the same Mr Keating who, in 1989, argued that surpluses were the rock that the economy was built upon. In 1992, when it was unsuitable in those times, he said, `Since when do we have to go back to surpluses? Since when were they holy writ?' It is the same Mr Keating on inflation. When he came to the task of fighting inflation he found it too hard, and he said in 1983, `Fighting inflation first is frankly a failure and frankly we have got to ditch it.' In 1985 he was still not doing well on inflation and he said, `We will not sacrifice growth in this economy on some altar for some idolatry on inflation and monetary growth that has no basis in fact.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in fact Mr Keating's own recession destroyed inflation, he came back boasting, `We have broken its back. Now we have got to keep it broken.' Those are the constant inconsistencies. It is the same Mr Keating who at one moment argues, `It is production, not spending, that generates jobs', and then last week produces his answer to unemployment&mdash;a $6.5 billion spending package. It is the same Mr Keating who a few years ago described the concept of enterprise bargaining as a joke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr President, that is not leadership. Where is the leadership in this budget? Where is the hand on the tiller? It is simply not there. Very briefly we will look at the income side of the budget. PAYE and personal taxes are to go up eight per cent. Remember the March 1992 statement from Mr Keating on bracket creep? He said it was gone forever. He said, `We will return to taxpayers the impact of inflation&mdash;even low inflation&mdash;on the tax system.' Now, bracket creep is back again and the tax take from the people is on the rise again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second tranche of tax cuts promised at the last election&mdash;sorry, not promised; l-a-w, law&mdash;are farther away than ever. Senator Gareth Evans said today that perhaps it would be in 1998. They are so far away that no-one can take them seriously. I remind the Senate that the wholesale sales tax goes up one per cent in July 1995. Many in the community have forgotten, but we will remind them, that these tax increases were legislated out of a deal done between the government and the Australian Democrats, and the Australian people are going to suffer the consequences of that deal during the course of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August fuel taxes go up, and in July 1995 sales tax goes up, and so it goes on. Taxation on superannuation funds is up 27 per cent. Receipts from fringe benefits taxes&mdash;so complex apart from the income that they generate&mdash;are going up a massive 131 per cent. Wine tax goes up again. I think Senator Kernot would have conveniently forgotten that one. So it goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government comes in and says, `This is not a budget about increased taxation.' Those opposite particularly want to take note that again it is the tax on lower income earners that rises disproportionately compared with the tax on higher income earners. This is all part of Labor's new definition of social justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happens on the expenditure side of the budget? With a typical Labor government, the budget cruises along, taxes go up, expenditure goes up another three per cent and the running costs of the public service increase by another $1 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When expenditure goes down, who has to make do? The answer is that the states again have to. Money being appropriated to the states goes down in real terms by about five per cent, and they are again expected to provide more services with less money. Incomprehensibly, road funding goes down. On the one hand, the government says it is wanting to create an export culture and then, on the other hand, it reduces funding for roads, which are a necessary part of the infrastructure to develop a competitive export economy. It is just incomprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other part that stands out in this budget is the borrowings. Again, one might say this is typical of Labor. Over the next three years Commonwealth public debt will treble, from $30 billion to approximately $90 billion. This is a staggering and, I would have thought, in anyone's language, a highly worrying increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening, of course, with this budget is that the farm is being sold off to pay for recurrent expenditure. It is not being done to retire debt, which was our plan&mdash;a responsible plan&mdash;but rather assets such as the Commonwealth Bank, the AIDC, and airports in due course, are being sold off to pay for the government's recurrent debt. Taxes go up, borrowings are massively increased, and, of course, it simply goes in the year's running costs. What is the outcome? A higher interest bill and higher capital debt that has to be repaid in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any small business man or woman would tell us that they would not survive on that recipe. But that is the formula that this government is giving for the management of the total Australian economy. That is why we say that the hands have left the tiller and this is not sound management. It is not the sort of economic framework that would give business the confidence it needs to invest, to grow and to employ. That is why we doubt that the government's predictions on business investment will be met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone knows that one of the major problems of the Australian economy is low savings&mdash;savings that would be invested in productive enterprise. How will massive new government borrowings to repay recurrent expenditure help build the necessary capital for investment in the private sector? Of course, they will not help. Those on the other side might like to reflect that, interestingly, this policy approach contrasts dramatically with what we put to the Australian people at the last election. Our alternative would have obviously built a stronger economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of contrast, by 1996-97 Labor will have collected as much indirect tax as the coalition would have gained from a GST&mdash;but without the compensation to low and middle income earners. Oh, how the electors were conned at that last election! Mr Keating, only two days after the election and in his usual rewriting of history, said, `This was not a referendum on the GST; it was a referendum on the way Australians lived.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In no small part because of this government's poor budgetary management&mdash;and also because it is in debt to sectional interest groups, particularly organised labour&mdash;Australians have not lived too well under Mr Keating. Not only do we have the appallingly high unemployment and underemployment figures, but household disposable income is lower now than it was under the coalition. Senator Murphy should reflect on that. Household disposable income was 3.5 per cent when the Labor Party came to office. The average of household disposable income over the last 11 years&mdash;what people can spend&mdash;is a measly 1.3 per cent. Growth in average weekly earnings, of course, has been lower again under Labor. </PARA>

That is Labor: the rich have got richer and the poor have got poorer. What a boast!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Going to the future, what is there in this budget&mdash;against this background of missed opportunity; this failure to really tackle the deficit when the opportunity was there&mdash;that tells us that interest rates will not rise again? It should be remembered that it was so few years ago that they reached a record 20.5 per cent nominal rate under Mr Keating's policies. Why will it not happen again?  Why will imports not be sucked in again and the current account deteriorate further? The clamp is put on again; there is more suffering, more bankruptcies and more of the same that we have received for 11 years. All the signs of the `boom, bust' cycle are there and that it will occur again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community surveys indicate that the public does not have confidence in Labor's economic management, and they are right. Australians were told in the budget statement they could look forward to the future `with considerable confidence'. Australians remember that it was the 1988 budget which `brought home the bacon'; the 1989 budget which was the gimmicks budget; the 1990 budget which was said to be the `Rolls Royce of budgets'; and the 1987 budget was the one with the rabbits falling out of the hat. The 1988 May statement was a `milestone in the transformation of the Australian economy', and the 1987 May statement maintained that Australia was `winning'&mdash;just before the stock market crash. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have heard it all before. They are sick of the exaggerations, the ducking and weaving and the self-praise. What they want is sound economic management and jobs, not just fast talk. Labor, under Keating, is not what it used to be. It is more exclusive rather than inclusive. It is more concerned with the privileged than the underprivileged and it is certainly no longer&mdash;if it ever was&mdash;the champion of the underdog. Keating, dripping with the trappings of power, talks about what we now have as a civilised Australia. He should be telling that to the unemployed, the dispirited, the homeless, and the Aboriginals living in Third World conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a different definition of a civilised society from that of Mr Keating. Under our model, a civilised society recognises individuals and encourages self-growth. It does not fear differences but is strong enough to be sensitive to the needs and suffering of others. A civilised society offers the caring hand to allow individuals to develop their potential within a positive framework which, in the end, helps society as a whole to grow stronger and more resourceful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our vision is one of a team working together. All members have their own strengths, which they develop and use to assist other members of the team to work more effectively and more productively. In this `recession we had to have', 500,000 jobs have disappeared and over one million Australians have suffered. There are now more of us depending on fewer of us than ever before in the history of this country. Australia has changed, but it has not necessarily changed for the better. It is now time for there to be some real leadership in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To go back to my theme, this budget was a chance for the government to set an economic framework that could have made a real difference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also a budget which puts political strategy ahead of just about everything else, including the responsibility of governing in the long term for all Australians. It is a budget which is geared as close as possible to the coalition's lowest common denominators, while keeping a foot in the camp of Labor tradition. It is, if senators will pardon the pun, a real downer of a budget. It is, in fact, a budget which shirks the hard decisions. It is a budget which cops out of meaningful tax reform and, in doing so, signals the government's failure to face up to the long-term problems facing this country.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, all Australians would welcome the expenditure measures in this budget. If we give people nothing for years, they are always very grateful when they get a little. They are not going to say, `No, thank you very much. It's not enough. We're going to give it back'.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that what has been given is nowhere near enough. Australia is coming out of the worst recession in two generations. One million Australians are without work. A record number still live below the poverty line. Our current account deficit remains out of control, although I note the government is calling next year's predicted rise in the current account deficit of $2 billion just a slight increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also on the cusp of a unique recovery&mdash;a low inflation and sustained recovery. If we can ride the different recovery time lines of the United States, Japan and Europe, and if we can take advantage of our geographical position in the world's fastest growing region, we should also have within our sights the very important goal of repairing the damage of the recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the consultative process, seven weeks ago the Australian Democrats submitted to the government a 55-page, fully costed budget proposal which had as its theme repairing the damage of the recession. We looked at the highly imaginative policy  initiatives coming out of the United States and Europe, as they too grapple with repairing the damage of the 1980s. We talked with key organisations, community groups and economists. We presented the government with fully funded proposals aimed, as I said, at addressing the damage done to ensure that as we moved down the path towards recovery we did not leave behind those Australians who were the recession's front-line casualties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also asked and made a serious attempt to answer the very difficult question of what the government could do to increase the employment generation capacity of the economy. We addressed the issue of taxation reform. We called for a reversal in the 40-year downward trend in public investment in infrastructure, and made a number of suggestions as to where that investment was most needed. We put forward a significant small business assistance package; we called for a strategic industry policy; and we suggested some innovative ideas for offering incentives to business to invest in labour and to take on additional employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the continued misrepresentations of those who opted out of the consultative process, I need to say yet again that we always understood as part of that process that we were not writing the budget. But we knew that by being at least a part of the process we would have the opportunity to put forward constructive alternatives, and they were debated and some have been taken up in part. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> made the point&mdash;I think this is a very important point, and I am sorry that more of the opposition are not here to hear it&mdash;that in the absence of any policy proposals from the opposition, these are the ones the government has on the table to deal with. But instead of seizing the opportunity, the government, with one eye on the financial markets and another on the next election, opted out of taking the hard decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, the government remains stuck between the rock of reducing the deficit and the hard place of ending long-term unemployment. As part of the consultative process, the Treasurer (Mr Willis) undertook to answer in detail about 24 questions from the Democrats. The 33-page response we got from him reveals some very interesting, if not twisted, priorities on the part of the government. For example, I have been told that we cannot base a tax system on the capacity to pay because&mdash;would honourable senators believe this&mdash;skilled individuals, like investment capital, are now internationally mobile. That might be the case for Treasury officials waiting for a sinecure at the OECD or a Hong Kong merchant bank, but it certainly does not gel as an excuse for failing to move towards a more progressive tax policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer also told us in his answers that our proposals to phase out payroll tax and give a tax incentive to small business to employ more workers would complicate the tax system. He went on to reject tax breaks for investment in labour by telling us that tax concessions generally are not effective at targeting assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On budget night, the Treasurer boasted of the $3 billion worth of tax breaks the government has given to investment in capital&mdash;a bit of hypocrisy there. The Democrats' $250 million tax boost for investment in labour looks much better targeted and much more socially responsible than that figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On small business, the Treasurer informed us that access to finance is not currently&mdash;Senator Boswell will be happy to know this&mdash;a major problem for small business. I bet that is news to Australian small businesses. Those who get out and talk to small business people, as the Democrats have done, would know it is quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our suggestion that access to the banking ombudsman be expanded to small business is rejected by the Treasurer because the government feels the system is working relatively well. Yet the ombudsman has had to turn away 42 per cent of claims because he does not have the jurisdiction to hear them&mdash;that is working really well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On infrastructure, the Treasurer blames the states for the decline in public infrastructure investment figures. He conveniently overlooks the role the Commonwealth cutbacks in Commonwealth grants to states have played in this trend. When we get to industry policy, the Treasurer's response to the Democrats' budget proposals is the usual one&mdash;government is not into picking winners. That has to be one of the most vacuous lines ever used by government. If it is not in the business of assisting industries and businesses which have some chance of success, what on earth is it doing; picking losers and bailing them out as we have seen over recent years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of this mixed-up thinking, this rationalising of the irrational, there is some minor progress in some key social and economic policy areas in the 1994 budget. I think the government deserves some credit for not falling completely into line with what Tim Colebatch in yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> called the `single-issue campaigners for deficit reduction'.

There is funding for a national telephone-typewriter service for the hearing impaired, and this is an especially welcome initiative, one supported by the Democrats in our budget submission to the government. There is an increase in overseas aid, although it is a disappointingly small one which does little more than maintain Australia's aid level of 0.34 per cent of GDP, which is less than half the United Nations recommended level and substantially less than countries such as Canada, France and Germany are giving. There are funds for a Daintree rescue package and a commitment to maintain world heritage funding. We congratulate the new environment minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When all is said and done, that just about covers the highlights of the 1994 budget. On the expenditure side, there are a lot of half-hearted expenditure measures which, yes, will appease many but actually please no-one. On the revenue side, there is a stack of fudged and wobbly figures. How are we going to pay for all this? It is an interesting list. We are going to get $300 million from unspecified compliance measures. We are going to get a huge $1,800 million to be collected from fringe benefits taxes&mdash;and we have to have faith in this, despite the fact that for the last two years the government has failed to meet its fringe benefits tax targets. We are going to get $2.45 billion from asset sales, despite the government having enormous difficulty in moving assets such as Qantas, HLIC and ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also some incredibly optimistic economic projections driving the budget bottom line. For a start, the immensely optimistic three per cent employment growth figure drives an expected $800 million fall in social security payments and a $4 billion, or eight per cent, rise in income tax receipts. If the government is out one per cent, that is how much the bottom line is affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the answer to the big question of how the government will pay for its white paper expenditure? It is going to pay for that by cutting public investment in infrastructure by $600 million, by cutting grants to the states by $3.4 billion, by selling assets, by overestimating $700 million of social security savings, and just generally by fudging figures&mdash;scarcely an inspiring response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are particularly disheartened by the government's attitude to the states. It is just so convenient. There is a $3.4 billion cut which follows on from the 16 per cent real cut which Canberra inflicted on the states in the 1980s. The result of that cut is that the states have shed nearly 200,000 jobs over the last five years. Now, after a few years of maintained grants, the government has brought out the razor on the states again. We do not have to be economic geniuses to figure out the consequences: increased pressure on hospitals, schools, public transport, and police services. All the federal government has to say is, `That is a state responsibility. Those cutbacks do not have anything to do with us.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real story is not what the budget did, but what it did not do. While this budget may go down, as I said, as one of the most boring in history, it will, I believe, also go down as one which failed to seize an important opportunity at a really significant point in Australia's economic development. That is the real tragedy of this budget. Our grandchildren will get the bill for this budget. They will be the ones left with the run-down schools, crumbling hospitals, polluted cities and public transport systems which do not work. They will be the ones left cleaning up our beaches, wondering where all our native forests went, and dealing with the health consequences of polluted air and water. They will be the ones left dealing with the consequences of decades of high unemployment. They will be the ones cursing us&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;for all the intractable social, environmental and economic problems we are bequeathing to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a bit like watching a re-run of a very bad old movie&mdash;a re-run of Britain or the United States, where we have watched decades of feel-good governments ignore the hard questions until the problems become so big that they are unfixable. While the problems are hard, they are not for the moment in Australia beyond fixing. It is not that the government lacks the capacity to do something about them; what it lacks is the political will. As I said, it cares more about the political strategy of getting to the next election than the political will for the long-term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does have the capacity to do something about improving the capacity of the economy to generate more jobs. It could have used this budget to move on tax reform, payroll tax, small business incentives, infrastructure investment and industry policy. Instead, the government has opted for a policy of rearranging the dole queue through labour market programs. Yes, it is a fairer queue; yes, it is a better trained queue; but everyone in it is still waiting for the same number of jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, neither the white paper nor the budget acknowledges the fact that, even after the $3 a week increase which appears in the budget, the rate of unemployment benefit to single adults remains about $15 a week below the poverty line&mdash;we are talking about the poverty line here, $15 a week below that&mdash;and that some payments for young unemployed people remain at about 75 per cent of the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government also has the capacity&mdash;not the will, but the capacity&mdash;to seriously tackle the problems within our health system, and, yes, it has failed to do that as well. The transparent con&mdash;and increasingly transparent, I think, as we get a chance to ask the questions in question time&mdash;it has perpetrated on Aboriginal people in this budget is shameful. To claim that the $500 million in Aboriginal health funding is new or extra is an insult and it represents, I think, a very major breach of trust on the part of the government with Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">And where is the comprehensive response to the national crisis in mental health? Why does one of the most neglected groups of people in Australia&mdash;a group Brian Burdekin described as `among the most vulnerable and disadvantaged in our community'&mdash;warrant a mere $40 million a year in additional expenditure? That is one-fifth of the minimum that Mr Burdekin estimated needed to be spent to properly begin to address the need identified in his report and I think it signifies the continuing failure of the Commonwealth to live up to its responsibilities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the government's commitment to the environment? For a start, expenditure on environment programs actually falls in real terms. There is no funding for coastal management. There is no new money set aside for biodiversity conservation or forest conservation. There is no new money for renewable energy technologies. Finally&mdash;and perhaps even most importantly&mdash;there is no recognition of the environment being a cross-sectoral issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has failed to act decisively to make Australia a fairer place. In fact, the only safety net measures in this budget appear as a consequence of last year's budget negotiations with the Democrats and the Greens. Our calls for more assistance for families, for elimination of poverty traps for the unemployed, for a commitment to reducing the costs of justice, and for extending family payments to farmers have been ignored. Our calls to provide greater assistance to regional Australia have largely been ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unemployment, social dislocation, the massive infrastructure needs identified by the Kelty Report, cuts in services, the hardship confronting farming families&mdash;none of these problems have been properly addressed in this budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under our budget proposals, virtually all of the `growth dividend' could have been ploughed back into reducing the deficit. But the government has not done that. Because those opposite apparently lack the vision, the leadership, the creativity to even review their revenue options&mdash;and they have plenty of them&mdash;the entire growth dividend, plus asset sales, will go into paying for recurrent expenditure. They would not run their own households this way. What would they be left with? A stick of furniture and a mattress. And even after that&mdash;even assuming that their very rosy growth rates, as they call them, are met to 1998&mdash;if and when we get to that seventh consecutive year of economic recovery, the federal budget will still be in deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because this government is apparently so chuffed with itself for taking Australia to the point of being the lowest taxed country in the western world, because it will not tackle the crucial issue of taxation reform and get out there and sell that reform to Australians, we have given ourselves no slack, no room, no allowance for the inevitable downturn. That means that the bill faced by our grandchildren will be that much bigger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition members, of course, face a problem with this budget because, despite their assertions to the contrary, the government's parameters are not far removed from their own. It is no wonder that they are desperately scratching around to find some point from which to attack the budget. They would have to be really economically illiterate or desperate to come up with the line that this is a tax and spend budget, for goodness sake. They would have to be desperate to try to convince Australians that bracket creep constitutes a new tax. Their desperation must indeed be dire to claim, as Mr Tim Fischer did on Tuesday night, that the budget was Whitlamesque. This budget, as the coalition knows, is none of those things&mdash;and the more's the pity. It is not a big taxing, big spending budget and its direction is about as far as possible from Whitlamesque as the government can go while still calling itself a Labor party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is time that the coalition stopped trying to pretend the budget is something it is not and turned its mind to what it can do to build on what is there. The Democrats and the coalition are both on record as saying that there are some key problems with the budget. I have written to Dr Hewson suggesting that we meet to discuss three areas of common concern: assistance to small business, overseas aid and Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, while it says it does not want to spend any more, actually asked on the record for increases in overseas aid. It wanted that. Alexander Downer said he supports the sales tax rebate on components which go into exported goods, and more money for Aboriginal health, but the coalition does not want to raise any revenue to pay for it either. It cannot have it both ways. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The 1994-95 budget is a document standing on poor foundations. It is built upon the foundations of hope&mdash;not substance. The government does very little to reinforce those foundations for the private sector, the sector on which it is basing all its hope. The budget is framed in the context of an Australia climbing out of recession and an Australia that suffered from many policy decisions of this government, particularly the extended period of high interest rates which have done so much damage to our existing industries and businesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are an Australia that is losing its traditional manufacturing base, with more and more Australian industries moving offshore. We are an Australia whose mining companies are spending increasing proportions of their exploration budgets on overseas projects. We have an efficient rural producing sector still struggling to stay afloat after years of unfair international trading practices which have lowered commodity prices, after the ravages of drought and after the high interest rate policies of the Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have entered a new period of growth but, through this budget, the growth dividend from a stronger economy is being used by the government to boost spending rather than to reduce the deficit. Growth is optimistically predicted by the government to be at least four per cent over the next four years, and the recovery period is forecast to last for longer than any other recovery period since the 1960s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The official budget deficit is $11.7 billion, down from an estimated deficit of $13.6 billion last year. But included in this are asset sales, still to be sanctioned by the ALP Left, of $2.5 billion. When we include the asset sales, transfer of state debt payments and Reserve Bank profits, the real deficit figure is more like $18 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget is silent on any new measures that address new capital investment for business, although it is based on a 14.5 per cent industry investment growth prediction. It fails to provide an environment that will stem the flow of industry and mining investments offshore. It is virtually silent on positives for the vast rural industries which still play their major role in export earnings and underpinning the living standards of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Personal income tax may not have obviously risen in the budget, but PAYE taxpayers will pay 8.1 per cent more income tax than last year. The promise of the second tax cuts seems to have faded from view forever. It seems that the promise of Mr Keating to return to taxpayers the impact of inflation over the next two years has gone the same way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our productive sectors will have increased burdens from increases in fuel excise already set in the pipeline by the government. Leaded petrol will increase by 2c in August, with unleaded petrol and diesel up 1c. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our basic infrastructure, such as our road system, has received reduced funding of $200 million in the budget. Over the last two years road funding has seen a reduction of almost half. In fact, forward estimates confirm that road funding will remain at levels that are, in actual dollar terms, below those of 1982-83. If the government is going to base its future hopes on a reviving business sector and increased exports, it cannot neglect the requirements such as our road system. The essential need for a strong and viable regional Australia has been given scant attention, despite the many government commissioned papers and recommendations. The white paper last week allocated a paltry $29.1 million to be spent this year on regional development, with over two-thirds of that going to Canberra's sewerage system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget, as it affects rural Australia, will do little to boost the rural and resources industries on which the government has pinned its hopes. While budget papers show an increase in government outlays of 5.9 per cent for primary industries in 1994-95, rural sector outlays will actually decrease. Wool growers have been told that their woes are now over and that they will no longer receive exceptional circumstances interest rate assistance. In reality, only nine per cent of all wool growers are presently making a positive income. Just one more year of assistance would have allowed many wool growers to stay on their farms and rebuild their flocks. The premature ending of exceptional circumstances assistance could be the end of many of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any increase in rural funding is because the diesel fuel rebate is up $56 million as a result of the government continuing to increase fuel excise and also because this year the government spent only $24.7 million on RAS, the rural adjustment scheme. It will spend $83 million this year, a more normal amount. In total, only $112 million, including $87 million from state reserves, was spent on RAS this year. This was $45 million less than predicted in last year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have long been an advocate of more equitable rural adjustment measures. The fact that there are millions of dollars in RAS reserves means that the government has done a very sloppy job in matching funds to needs. It has made the eligibility criteria too strict for farmers suffering adverse circumstances beyond their control. The much touted wool package of the previous minister is a case in point: $44.6 million he promised to 5,790 specialist woolgrowers. By the end of December 1993, there were only 1,367 approvals nationwide, with a miserly 214 from Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time and time again we have asked, as has the wool industry, for the eligibility criteria regarding the 65 per cent income from wool requirements to be eased. It was impossible to live on your income if at least 65 per cent of it came from wool because the prices were so low. But, no, the government was happy to see the money go unspent so it could embark on the recycling venture which we see in the budget this week. RAS reserves of $45.7 million are now to go into a mystical kind of regional fund if not spent on direct farmer aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993-94 the states were to contribute $103.8 million  in RAS reserves to the RAS budget. This was on top of nearly $13 million savings not spent from the exceptional circumstances package. This week's budget papers say, however, that $87 million of state reserves were drawn upon, leaving $45 million available for a downturn in the future. Every year the government puts out two budget bins for collection, one for the ordinary money to go out and one with a yellow top for recycling. The government promises funds and packages of all shapes and sizes, gets great media coverage, and then keeps a lot of the money so that it can make the same promises again the next round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Meanwhile, there are efficient producers out west who have cashed in their super, who cannot get RAS or JSA, who have pulled their kids out of school, who have laid off workers and who have hand-fed their dwindling stock for three years. This year 4,400 out of 8,500 RAS approvals received exceptional circumstances funding. That is over half the client base, and the minister publicly acknowledged that it will take a couple of years for farmers to get back on their feet. So why has the government allocated only a paltry $2.5 million to extend drought exceptional circumstances funding for a mere six months and ended wool exceptional circumstances funding altogether?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the regional rhetoric. The minister wants Australian farmers to engage in a lucky dip, to compete for regional project funds&mdash;only there will probably be two boxes for the proposals, one for the Labor marginal electorates and one for the rest. There is to be a competitive bidding process for funding from the reserves plus a state RAS levy. How will the government decide who is to receive funds and where? Will influential, well-connected groups thrive, while individual farmers lose out? There is great scope for discrimination. The first priority for RAS is to give a solid commitment to direct farm assistance, yet nowhere in this budget is such a figure or commitment to be found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The $252 million approved funding in the budget for interest subsidies over three years does not sound too hot when we consider that total expenditure in 1992-93 was $166 million&mdash;and that was not enough to stop hundreds of family farmers from doing it real tough. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has done some creative work with the primary industry budget. While the budget shows $1.7 billion will be spent on agriculture, forestry and fishing, farmers themselves will contribute $728 million in taxes and charges, and $515 million in diesel fuel rebates. A further $90.3 million will go to the department and $15.3 million in redundancy payments to surplus meat inspectors&mdash;reforms that the government should have undertaken years ago to remove excess cost from the meat industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tobacco growers are to suffer a further fallout from five per cent excise rises in August and February next. With this $133 million windfall to the government, the government should set it aside to fund a buyout scheme for the tobacco industry. The government also should have addressed the restructuring needs of the citrus industry and provided for the recommendations of its own task force. The needs of the citrus industry are urgent due to the implementation of the Uruguay Round. The government's own citrus task force recommendations should have been provided for and the recommended sales tax exemptions introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A problem which affects all Australia and hurts rural people hard is unemployment, with one-third of our under 25-year-olds unemployed. In last week's white paper on employment, spending on labour market programs skyrocketed to  over $3 billion over four years, yet the government has never got unemployment below 10 per cent. This year through the job compact the government has expanded the jobstart wage subsidy program with a youth training component, after receiving permission from its masters, the ACTU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition have long advocated the necessity of having a youth training wage, an essential provision if the young people are ever to get a crack at the work force and acquire experience. While the job compact encompasses programs targeted at the unemployed in rural and regional Australia, the private base sector in these areas is small with limited prospects. Most jobstart opportunities come from industries based in the capital cities. Not much is going on in the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one program specifically targeted at regional Australia&mdash;the new work opportunities program&mdash;which involves landcare projects and human services programs, such as care for the elderly, will not provide great opportunities to the average rural youngster. Those priorities will be given to the indigenous Australians and some of the disabled. While we do not oppose that, we make the point that it excludes some jobs that would have gone to regional youth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the budget allocation of $1.5 billion for an Aboriginal land fund, it is hoped the experience of the Northern Territory is not followed, where good cattle country has been bought only to be taken out of production. The fund potentially represents a large number of properties that could be purchased. Any loss of production will have definite flow-on effects, not only to output but also to rural employment through reduced throughput at abattoirs and in the  road transport industry&mdash;just to name two examples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business, which represents 700,000 companies and employs 2,570,000 people, has not been helped by this budget. The government has failed to reduce costs and charges on small business. The superannuation guarantee levy, sales tax, payroll tax, fuel tax and fringe benefits tax all rise under this budget. Fringe benefits tax is up 131 per cent, sales tax will return 8 per cent more, with petrol tax up 13 per cent more on ordinary motorists and businesses. Fuel excise has now reached 30c a litre&mdash;not only a massive cost impost on freight and transport, but all adding costs on to our exporters competing in a world market where foreign governments do not impose the same harsh taxes on their exporters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business sector should be the powerhouse of the Australian economy. It has the ability to respond quickly to employ more people. It is innovative and flexible. It should be encouraged so it can create more jobs and solve Australia's unemployment. Yet even the white paper on unemployment will create further worries for small business, with the confirmation yesterday that businesses taking on the unemployed under subsidies will be subject to the oncosts of workers compensation, superannuation and the oppressive dismissal provisions of the government's new industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, out of the budget small business got higher registration and corporation fees despite seeking relief from real measures that unfairly impose costs on them. Just changes were refused to small businesses, such as the reduction in the provisional tax uplift factor, deferral on capital gains tax where rolled into another business, relief from indirect taxes on business inputs and exporters, and tax concessions for training and establishment costs. Neither small business, nor big business, nor our exporting, mining and agricultural industries has been assisted by this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is keen to stress the growth of elaborately transformed manufactures which earned $18 billion in export earnings last year. It is good to see the export base being broadened and the increasing contribution from ETMs, but at the same time we are rapidly losing our traditional manufacturing base. Last year $8 billion worth of manufacturing industry was lost offshore from New South Wales alone. Thirteen per cent of the exporters that the McKinsey inquiry spoke to had moved offshore, with a further 50 per cent planning to do so. Manufacturing is going backwards, with imports going up more rapidly than exports. Our manufacturing trade deficit is higher now than ever. The government must not lose sight of what industries it already has here, what we are good at and what we do well. The government must not lose sight of the substance for the myth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government would do well to remember Senator Evans's words to the NFF dinner last night. He said that the agriculture sector `had not only been exporting longer and harder than any other industry in Australia, but it has for many years helped secure for Australians one of the highest per capita incomes in the world' and that the latest international projections show the world's population doubling by the year 2050 and the demand for food trebling, with a decline in food production of up to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time through this budget the government is cutting off the short-term lifeline to wool growers by concluding exceptional circumstances assistance to wool growers when it can underspend on rural assistance programs by $45 million last year and when it can cut spending to essential research bodies such as the CSIRO by 2.5 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The white paper delivered last week misrepresented funding increases for science agencies when in fact the CSIRO will be at least $15 million to $20 million worse off this year. With this decrease comes a probable loss of 200 positions, especially in rural research. The budget has further decreased funding to the CSIRO this year by 2.5 per cent, with a further decline over the next three years of 5.6 per cent in real terms&mdash;another assault on rural industry research and a further cruel blow to the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must not lose sight of our well established rural and mining industries, which still earn Australia a combined export income of $37 billion. We must also try to retain our basic manufacturing industries. We must value add to our primary industries and not have a repeat of incidents such as the loss of our opportunity to enter the refined sugar export market by rejecting the merger that would have created a large export refinery in Mackay. We must take advantage of our clean food produced in Australia and our proximity to the large markets in Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this budget, the government has squandered the benefits of our economic recovery. Less than half of the windfall gains from improved and faster economic growth have been used to cut the deficit.

The budget is, however, based on certain key assumptions in relation to business investment and employment creation, which I find very questionable. It is interesting that the Treasurer (Mr Willis) appears to be having similar doubts about these assumptions. The assumption that there will be a reduction of those on unemployment benefits to about half their current level, that is, to 500,000 people, should be reviewed in the context of the lack of real commitment in this budget to the creation of long-term job opportunities for the hundreds of thousands of long-term unemployed when they have completed their training or work experience.</PARA></TALK.START>

Honourable senators will also understand that many young people now officially stop being unemployed, not that anything will really have changed; it is just that they will not be called unemployed anymore, so some of these figures will be balanced out. We have mentioned many of these criticisms already in relation to the white paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to eliminate unemployment payments to these officially 500,000 people on an ongoing basis, well over 600,000 jobs will need to be created, and not just short-term jobs that lead to a continuing cycle of employment and unemployment. The budget is predicated on job increases twice: in reduction of payments for unemployed and in increases in income tax revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major assumptions are on business investment and growth. These may or may not come good, and the Treasurer is now hedging his predictions on his own very optimistic investment growth forecasts. Unfortunately, the government is overreliant on investment from transnational export industries, over whom the government has no real control. The idea of telling these corporations what to do is nearly as ridiculous as the spectacle of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) standing up in the House and criticising the money markets for having no faith in his government's economic policy direction. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The money markets he criticised recently are currency speculators, trading about $900 billion a day. They are mainly institutional speculators in the United States and Europe and, in the opinion of the Greens, have too much influence on the direction of economic policy in this country. Despite the Prime Minister's criticism, this government determines much of its economic policy according to the dictates of these gamblers and speculators. As I mentioned, the budget may please the money markets, but is it socially responsible, is it ecologically responsible and is it even economically responsible outside of a narrow bookkeeper's framework?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Few measures in this budget move us more than incrementally towards more social justice. There are also few positive measures for the environment, with the rare exception of the Daintree rescue package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A basic problem is the underlying assumptions in current economic orthodoxy. The government approach assumes that we cannot survive without substantial foreign investment and that value-added goods in Australia which substitute for imports can be sacrificed to allow for increased markets for primary goods. The perceived need to attract foreign companies to make or mine or cut down or kill for the export market&mdash;in short, to asset-strip this nation&mdash;has resulted in a reduction in control over our national economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since regulation frustrates transnational corporations and investors, regulation has been reduced; they can avoid proper scrutiny and they continue to call for the removal of many of the existing investment controls and guidelines. We cannot control what they do, how they invest or whether they invest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only option is to please them and promise them that the government will help them make more money here than they can in Vietnam, in South Africa, or in China. So we grovel and lower our taxes in competition with Asia, in competition with nations that have virtually no social support programs or proper environmental standards. We promise them cheap power, cheap roads and cheap diesel. We make clear that they really do not have any obligations to give anything back, and that we will help them with trade promotion and other programs. We will help cut their expenses. This is on top of a 160 per cent tax break on research and development, which may not result in product development in Australia. We will get CSIRO to do their research. We will make researchers in universities more accountable to the needs of corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will take away any obligation for training, while increasing industry-tailored training programs funded by the public. We will subsidise workers at the low-paid end of the jobs market. We will use the accord and the famous cooperation between the government and the ACTU to hold wages down. We will help push for erosion of union power through enterprise bargaining and individual contracts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, Mr Willis, on page three of his budget speech, said, `Real unit labour costs are declining'&mdash;that means wages&mdash;`and profit share is near an all time high.' We know that. On page five, the Treasurer said, `In addition, this government has created a very favourable tax regime for businesses over recent years.' We know that, too. So how do we pay for all these things, and who pays? Effectively, the wage earners of this nation and the small businesses pay for these subsidies through taxes. Company taxes decline, and transnational corporations may pay effective rates of tax of under five per cent. Last year the government gave personal tax cuts to those making over $20,000 per year, about half of all taxpayers. But the biggest cuts went to those at the top, who got a cumulative increase which amounted to a tax cut of $1,224 to everyone making over $50,000 a year, the top 10 per cent. So the ordinary person pays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there is a limit to how much more the government can get the poorer people to pay, especially when it is holding down wages. So, the solution has been to cut public sector services and privatise some government enterprises. In this budget we have got the Federal Airports Corporation, the AIDC and Qantas all on the auction block. While we allow media ownership to concentrate in fewer hands, often overseas hands, we sell off telephone services in the name of competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In COAG and the white paper the government has paved the way for wholesale sell-offs of state infrastructure. It talks about private provision of employment services while cutting CES budgets at a time when employment and case management approaches are being touted. Budget efficiency is being put in everywhere on social programs, and cuts to state funding, coupled with benchmarking programs designed to push the erosion of services, guarantee that cuts to services will occur at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One way the government could have addressed the issue of regaining some meaningful improvements in the economy was through economic restructuring in regional development to create more self-sufficient regionally based economies. Regional development was supposed to be a special area of government action in this budget, but let us look at what has been done. Assistance to states has been underspent by a minimum of $88 million on the surface&mdash;but other programs, of course, have been cut as well&mdash;and urban and regional development was underspent by $19 million or 17 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme was underspent by $20 million, or 44 per cent. Natural resources and management were underspent by $5.2 million, or six per cent. These were programs from last year. Basically the government is hiding the fact that it has underspent on these programs, and that has been mentioned by previous speakers. We mentioned this on budget night and nobody else caught on. In some areas this underspending carries through. Estimates for assistance to states are revised downwards by $144.7 million next year and by $243 million in 1995-96. In other areas, such as the rural adjustment scheme, the estimates are increased by $10 million. This is supposed to be an area of new funding, to pay for projects such as the Sunraysia development. In fact, the increase over last year's forward estimate is only half of the underspending on this year's budget, and there is no promise that underspending will not continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the four year planning period, rural adjustment funding declines from a high of $83.9 million in 1994-95 to $65.1 million the next year, to $39.3 million and $41.7 million in the next two years. Urban and regional development continues its decline from $95 million in 1993-94, to $71 million, to $68 million, to $62 million, to $48 million by 1997-98. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Natural resources development and management funding for landcare and other land management areas goes down from $87.4 million in 1994-95 to $86.7 million, to $71 million, to $65 million by 1997-98. It becomes more clear why the government emphasises regional self-funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Funding for the environment also continues its decline. As noted, the natural resources and development area declines steadily. It has become a victim of underspending in spite of heavy lobbying by farmers and environmentalists. The decline is 25 per cent over four years. Does this mean that the government now believes land and water management problems have been solved or are under control?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">National estates and parks gets a `boost' this year, with the Daintree rescue. What was not said was that the estimate in the 1993-94 program budget went from $144.4 million to $115.5 million in this one. An amount of $29 million was underspent on what was appropriated, a reduction of 20 per cent. This more than pays for the `increases'. The increases are also dependent on Queensland putting in a share of the Daintree package and so is not under the control of the federal government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any case, the budget for this area supposedly goes up next year to $125 million, thanks to the downward adjustment of this year from $144 million. It then declines to $116 million, to $88 million, to $84 million by 1997-98; that is a drop of 42 per cent by 1997-98. Basically, it seems that the government is increasing its expenditure; in fact, it has decreased expenditure considerably from last year's estimates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental protection was another area of underspending. This year's funding estimates dropped by $7.7 million, or 11 per cent of the program budget. There is a boost in 1994-95 to $113 million, mainly for spending on rehabilitation of Maralinga. From that point funding declines to $89 million, to $55 million, to $56 million in 1997-98&mdash;a fall of 50 per cent over the four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the government believes it does not need to do anything much for the environment. Clearly, its increases are rearrangements rather than real increased commitment. And this is just in the obvious areas of environment. We know about the lack of commitment to doing anything about the greenhouse problem, about building in energy efficiency anywhere. The Auditor-General's report has noted the poor performance in even implementing its own programs on greenhouse gas reductions. We have heard suggestions that the government's answer to the problem of the need to maintain a differential between recycled and non-recycled paper products through a concessional tax will be answered by eliminating all exemptions on recycled goods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of social justice, the two big areas where the government is supposed to be moving ahead in this budget are employment and Aboriginal issues. In the area of employment the government has done very little to create real jobs, in spite of many suggestions. It has not even considered issues like the structure of work, the issue of overwork and underwork, the length of the normal week, the issue of secure part-time work, and the process of casualisation of labour, especially in the public sector. It is continuing to put pressure on spending in departments that can only lead to further public sector job cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has put up a program to statistically reduce the number of long-term unemployed by creating a rotating pool of subsidised, low-paid labour. Does the government really think that such a system will not see people now working put off and a downwards pressure on wages generally?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On Aboriginal issues, again the outcomes do not match the rhetoric. When we compare the budget from last year with that from this year we see again the `downward adjustment' of budgets. In the Abstudy budget there is a decline from $238.3 million to $150.5 million for the 1993-94 year between budgets. This is underspending by 37 per cent, or $88 million. This carries over to subsequent estimates, and all forward estimates for Abstudy are down about $87 million in each year. This is about one-third of the budget. It is easier to find $160 per year for Aboriginal issues if we have just `saved' it from Abstudy and other existing programs. Migrant education is another area that has suffered `underspending'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">`Underspending' is rife. It is easy to make something look like an increase if we revise the previous year's spending downwards. It is easier to find `new' money if we have not spent it in the first place. Of course, there are exceptions. The Defence department overspent by $14 million&mdash;not much compared to the Defence budget but surprising given the reported scramble to spend as much as possible over the last few weeks. For this reason we continue to call for accountability in the Defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government is hardly a capital intensive business. Such underspending is associated with massive job losses, and even Defence has shed its personnel enormously in order to increase its spending on war toys. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are very disappointed that the government backed out on its commitment to increase foreign aid to 0.4 per cent of GDP by 1995. While it could be argued that their are increases in some areas of foreign aid, maintaining the aid budget static in GDP terms is not an increase in any sense, and aid is always considered as a percentage of GDP. We also note that forward estimates signal that aid will actually decline. Much of the aid budget is still related more to Australia's trade requirements rather than to the very real need for genuine humanitarian aid and the need to assist communities to sustain themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This budget gives little chance for the parliament to address the real problems facing Australia. It gives little hope for those in the community who have contributed their ideas to solve these problems. It does not address any of the underlying social, ecological or economic problems facing us. It does nothing for regional Australia, and signals another round of sell-offs of infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those parties such as the Greens and the Democrats who have been consulting widely with community groups on the issues associated with this budget have been deliberately left little leverage in this budget. The policies of the government and the opposition are now so similar that it hardly matters. The community will suffer. We know where this government's priorities lie. This is a budget designed to restrain wage inflation by a government that is so blind as to think that this is the noblest of aims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to respond to the comments of Senator Hill who claimed that the minor parties had stitched up a deal in advance via the consultative budget approach. Let me tell him that the government sent more information to the media than it shared with the Greens (WA). We agreed to be part of the consultative process so that we could pass on he real concerns of a wide range of community groups. If there is evidence that the government understands those needs it will have our support. If it brings forward legislation which clearly works against those needs, we will not support it. </PARA>
