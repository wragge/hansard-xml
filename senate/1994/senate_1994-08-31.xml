<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion requires the tabling before the close of business tomorrow of a detailed list of all the documents specified in the motion. I simply indicate that this is a holding position. After discussions with Senator Coulter, it has been agreed that we should require the government to table that list ahead of Senator Coulter having a full briefing from the government about why the government should not be required to table all of those documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a preliminary exercise, it makes some sense to be able to define the nature and extent of the documentation because we do not want a situation to arise where the government claims that there are thousands of documents that will involve hundreds of hours to compile. We had all this before with pay television and other things. To avoid that sort of a furphy, it would be helpful to be able to define those documents, some of which we might regard as having much greater priority than others. We can then refine the matter accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other than that, I would certainly hope that the Democrats will agree that, given that the government has seen fit to unilaterally release the due diligence report from Salomon Bros/Price Waterhouse, doing catastrophic damage to the value of ANL, it simply cannot be argued now that these documents should not be made available because of some commercial-in-confidence prejudice that might arise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I very much hope that after a briefing from the minister, the Democrats will acknowledge the wisdom of the public now having full access to these documents so that we can understand the reasons for the decision, the relationship they might have, for example, to the upcoming national conference, and whether all of what has happened in the last couple of weeks was necessary and justified. I hope that we will proceed accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank Senator Alston for modifying his motion in this way. The argument that has been put to the Democrats is that there are, among this list of documents, those which are commercial-in-confidence. As yet, we have not been able to test that proposition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very proud to present the report on public interest whistleblowing, particularly as it was established by the Senate on my motion in September last year, because it is a very important national issue and also because the committee has worked so well as a team. Its work has been marked by harmony and cooperation. I am very pleased also to be able to say that the report is unanimous and for that I must give credit to my colleagues Senator Murphy, Senator Chamarette, Senator Calvert, Senator Denman and formerly Senator Beahan in the early stages of the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No committee report can achieve success without very good committee secretariat back-up, and for that I want to thank Elton Humphery, Yvonne Marsh, Sue Irvine, Angela Stanley and Winifred Jurcevic, and also of course the witnesses. We had something like 120 submissions and over 60 people actually gave evidence in person. Without the witnesses, and particularly those who themselves have been involved in whistleblowing, we could not have understood the extent of the problem as well as we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our work has built on previous inquiries, including the Gibbs committee review of criminal law in 1991, the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration reports of 1991 and 1992 and the House of Representatives inquiry on fraud last year, together with commissions of inquiry in Queensland, New South Wales and Western Australia, all of which touched to some degree or other on the issue of whistleblowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We feel that this is clearly an issue whose time has come. But in talking about the mechanics of whistleblowing, the question of legislation and the structure of protection mechanisms, the Senate should bear in mind comments made by Dr Simon Longstaff of the St James Ethics Centre. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In discussing the issue of whistleblowing there is a tendency to lose sight of the fact that our deliberations have a direct bearing on the welfare of individual human beings and, through them, on society at large. It is somewhat paradoxical that in developing systems and procedures that protect whistleblowers one can be seduced by the intellectual challenges of developing technique to such an extent that the human scale of the problem is lost from sight.</PARA>
<PARA>We believe that those who have not been sensitised to the issue of whistleblowing can often be sceptical of the motives of whistleblowers. I think it is true to say that committee members developed a much greater understanding and appreciation of the personal issues involved as the inquiry progressed. Witnesses constantly referred to the diminution of the traditional values of ethics, honesty and professional integrity at all levels of society. They pointed out that they see a culture of self-interest and reduced responsibility which has overtaken that of public duty and the greater national interest. It is within that environment that the practice of whistleblowing has steadily grown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who are whistleblowers? Let us not spend time now forming a definition, but they come from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, have a range of educational qualifications and have been described to us as extremely conscientious and, before deciding to blow the whistle, regarded as highly valued employees by their organisation. Often they have been socialised through their family and through the education system to believe in the institutions of the Westminster system such as parliament and bureaucratic accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whistleblowers find it difficult to believe and accept that they should receive an adverse reaction to their disclosure. Sometimes people become whistleblowers by accident&mdash;being in the wrong place at the right time. Sometimes they do not realise they are involved until it is too late, and they are not aware that they have become whistleblowers until they suffer a detriment from the organisation. They may also be motivated by personal benefit or malice or ill-will. But we believe that disclosures made in good faith with the best of intentions may sometimes also be based on little more than supposition or innuendo and can have serious impact on other people and property. It is quite feasible that a factual disclosure could be made with malicious intent but, irrespective of the motivation, that disclosure would still warrant an investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People often begin by using internal mechanisms to report their problems and then find that the system turns on them. They may be ostracised by their colleagues. They may be made artificially redundant. They may find that the initial inquiry, if it is flawed, is a problem from which they never recover because any subsequent investigations tend not to go back behind the original investigation so, therefore, all further reports are likely to be defective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The personal cost to the whistleblower is enormous. There can be loss of career and employment prospects, financial loss, damage to personal and professional reputation, protracted legal processes and damage to personal life, including loss of spouse or partner, family, friends and health. The whistleblower is accused of diminished work performance, personality faults and psychological imbalance. Through a process of victimisation and harassment, the whistleblower is shunned by previously supportive and friendly work mates. I could go on and on. The report elaborates on these areas to a great degree, but in the limited time available I want to move on to some other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were asked: Is there a need for legislation? We have come firmly to the view that there is and that national legislation is required such as will cover the field as widely as possible. We recognise the constitutional limitations which mean that in some areas it will be necessary to have complementary state legislation. In some areas it may be necessary for industries to provide mechanisms for employees in the private sector because we have come firmly to the view that it is not just appropriate to provide for a more ethical public sector; it is important, in light of the past, to also cover the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will just draw the attention of honourable senators to the sorts of problems that whistleblowers are able to delineate. The Commonwealth alone spends something like $9 billion annually on goods and services. Opportunities for fraud exist in those areas. We have had Department of Social Security officials&mdash;11 of them in the past year&mdash;charged with fraud against their department at a cost of something between $2 million and $3 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had evidence given to us about corruption in academia. We have had evidence given to us as to the massive losses that have taken place in the banks of Australia, the financial institutions and in corporate Australia. Companies that have failed may not have if, perhaps, there had been a whistleblower who had a satisfactory method of reporting those losses to shareholders and to people involved in the private sector as well as to the taxpayer, who is concerned about losses in the public sector. These things could have been redressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a lot of evidence also about the need for whistleblowing in the police forces, so we welcome the establishment of the royal commission investigating the New South Wales police service, which will give particular attention to internal investigations and the internal informers' policy. We are concerned too about the remarks made by the Human Rights Commissioner, Mr Burdekin, in his national inquiry into the human rights of people with mental illness. He pointed out the difficulty of getting people, who did not want to be identified, to give evidence, which they wanted to be in camera, because of fear of reprisals from employers or colleagues. The patients and the carers were the people who genuinely felt themselves to be in considerable danger if they gave evidence to his inquiry and he felt that there was a need for enhanced whistleblower protection mechanisms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were pleased to know that the Attorney-General's Department, the Public Service Commission and a number of Commonwealth bodies recommended that we should move to legislating for whistleblower protection. I have some difficulty in trying to select the important points to bring to the attention of honourable senators in the limited time available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have opted for a small, independent agency to take the oversight of all matters relating to whistleblowing. We do not want to have a burgeoning, costly monster. (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Extension of time granted</EMPHASIS>) We are concerned not to make an expensive monster, for the taxpayer to fund, to deal with this problem. We do believe that some of the existing mechanisms can be used, provided an independent organisation is there to act as a protector, if you like, of the whistleblowers in both the public and the private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also point out that counselling of whistleblowers has to be one of the most important things that we could do in a national scheme. We have looked at a model which is already in operation in the United Kingdom run by a body called Public Concern at Work. They can advise whistleblowers before they blow the whistle as to whether to, or how to, and to whom, and they can stand by them to cope with any fallout from their having blown the whistle. Such an organisation needs to be funded fairly independently of government by contributions from the corporate world, perhaps from unions as well as governments, as well as from philanthropic citizens; and it needs to be administered by a totally independent board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also believe that the public interest disclosures agency which we propose should be established should be also under the administration of an independent board which would have representatives of the parliament as well as other people; should report annually to parliament; and should also be able to bring special reports, as the need arose, to the parliament, on which reports action would be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people have concerns about disclosure to the media, and we have canvassed that issue fairly carefully in our report. We believe that people should be able to go to the media in certain circumstances and still get the protection of the legislation that we propose, but they will need to have assured themselves before they do it, from advice and counselling, as to what their position will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an issue which the Gibbs committee has addressed in the past, that is, the question of disclosure of information in areas such as the defence and intelligence gathering world. We have agreed with the Gibbs and Elliott committees that, given the sensitive nature of that sort of information, in order for a whistleblower to be exempt from any relevant secrecy provisions, the disclosure should be made to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried to define a whistleblower and the act of whistleblowing in as wide a term as possible. I will not go into those now. There have been different definitions of whistleblowing going around, but we do believe that, in order to contain costs, it is important that small or frivolous matters should be screened out first and forwarded to alternative mechanisms for investigation. They should not just drop through the cracks, but they are not properly the concern of a public interest disclosures agency, which is designed to deal with matters of real substance, gross maladministration and corruption&mdash;things of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that whistleblowing is a legitimate form of action within a democracy and that there are and have been, and will continue to be, occasions on which whistleblowing is the only available avenue for the concerned, ethical citizen to expose wrongdoing in the public or the private sector. We appreciate that legislation is not enough and it will not of itself do the job. We do believe that there needs to be a shift in traditional workplace values and ethics. Legislation needs to be accompanied by national leadership at the political level, at the workplace level, from corporate Australia and from the unions as well. It should be accompanied by an education program specifically targeted at workplace ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rejoice in the unanimous nature of this report because it is a vital national issue. It is one which requires action in the public interest. This report deserves careful study. Many complex and delicate issues have been studied. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

In doing so, I thank the chairman of the committee, Senator Newman, for a job very well done, committee members&mdash;Senator Chamarette, Senator Calvert and Senator Murphy&mdash;the witnesses and, of course, the members of the secretariat for their work throughout the committee process and the preparation of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Beahan became President of the Senate, I replaced him on this committee. I have found the work complex and rewarding. My initial thoughts when confronted with this issue were, I guess, like those of many others on the committee: how on earth is it possible to differentiate between rivalry and personality clashes and legitimate accusations? What sort of protection will be afforded the accused? And, of course, what long-term protection, in every sense, will be afforded the whistleblower? I imagined some very bitter disputes in large public and private organisations that would be impossible to effectively judge when one considered endless evidence of paper trails, personalities involved and who is really responsible to whom. I was also concerned with the costs associated and the duplication of current resources&mdash;for example, the ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I remarked earlier, the issues are complex. However, overall, I am comfortable with the committee's recommendations. It is important, in my view, that we acknowledge whistleblowing as a legitimate form of action within a democracy. It is my belief that there will indeed continue to be occasions on which whistleblowing is the only avenue for ethical citizens to expose wrongdoing in the public and private sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear that our nation's values and ethics have not fostered or encouraged individuals to whistleblow. There will need to be cultural change&mdash;Senator Newman has already alluded to that&mdash;that will require national leadership strategies in both the private and public sectors, together with education programs targeted at workplace ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It follows that, if we are to legitimately expect whistleblowing, we have to provide legislation to enable disclosures to be made in the public interest. Therefore, I endorse the recommendations that legislation be enacted to establish an independent agency to be known as the public interest disclosures agency and a public interest disclosures board. Agency accountability and board representation were key factors in our consideration. It is my view that the report recommendations clearly set out an achievable and democratic platform. Further legislative coverage across both the public and private sectors should be as widely constitutional as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also strongly believes that cooperation between the Commonwealth, states and industry groups is essential if we are to see whistleblower protection reform at a national level. My concerns regarding the protection of the identity of whistleblowers and the subject of the disclosure are, in my view, covered. This will be achieved via the agency having the authority to protect the identity of the maker of the disclosure on application. The reverse of any such order will apply to the subject of the disclosure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think our work has covered all issues that ensure that a fair assessment of this complex subject can be made. The independence of the agency is the key. It will enact, provided the recommendations are adhered to, an open system which facilitates the reform processes in the public and private sectors. It is our best chance to ensure that waste and corruption are exposed in the public interest. I commend the report to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to wholeheartedly support the final report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. I would like to say at the outset that being a member of the committee has certainly been an outstanding experience&mdash;both in the way the committee has gone about its business and the often deeply moving evidence with which we were presented during the hearings we conducted around the country. For me, the tenor of committee meetings was significantly better than that of other committees I have attended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chairperson, Senator Newman, deserves commendation for the way in which the committee operated. The meetings were always cordial, and there was a sense that the committee was working together to produce a first-class report. I do not think this is a matter that the committee is congratulating itself about, even though I believe that the support we received from the secretariat and the work that was done was of the highest quality. I think we were expressly motivated by the witnesses who made written submissions and also appeared before us. There is no doubt that the motivation of the committee's work was increased by the integrity and credibility of those witnesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence presented to the committee was often very upsetting for us, as we heard case after case of people's lives being destroyed by the events that followed their whistleblowing. It is clear to all of us that no amount of legislative or bureaucratic intervention would have reduced the gross personal damage to these individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whistleblowing is an action taken by individuals. Often an individual, in taking that action, incurs the wrath of an entire organisation. In other instances, the action may not threaten the organisation but does threaten other people within the organisation who are more powerful than the whistleblower. Because of this, it is often hard for a whistleblower to be heard within the ordinary complaints processes of the organisation and it is also likely that the whistleblower will have great difficulty remaining in the organisation, or at least in the same job within the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence we received showed that usually a person who was blowing the whistle within their organisation was doing it from the very best of interests&mdash;not from any self-interest but from a concern that they would be doing their job and that the agency or organisation of which they were a part was to be operating at the highest standard possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, a frequent consequence of whistleblowing is that other people no longer feel that they can trust the whistleblower. They see the person's action as disloyal or breaching an unwritten code of conduct&mdash;a code of conduct based on `not dobbing in a mate' or not speaking out, being crushed and having other people around you crushed as well. It is for these reasons that it was very difficult, and still is, to find a mechanism which is capable of providing a satisfactory or lasting protection for whistleblowers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's terms of reference in conducting its inquiry involved examining, in particular, firstly, what persons and organisations as subjects of whistleblowing should be covered by the legislation; secondly, the nature of any protection that should be extended to whistleblowers and to the subjects of whistleblowing; thirdly, whether a new agency should be created to receive and investigate disclosures and to investigate any discrimination suffered by whistleblowers as a result of these disclosures, or whether an existing Commonwealth agency should have that role; fourthly, what powers any investigating body should have; fifthly, the nature of any protection that should be extended to any investigating body and its members; and, sixthly, what remedies and penalties should be provided for whistleblowers and for the subjects of whistleblowing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference were extended to include an examination of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1993. On 12 December 1991, former senator Jo Vallentine, then senator for the Greens (WA), introduced a private member's bill entitled the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. Following her resignation from the Senate in January 1992, I gave a commitment to pursue that or similar legislation early in my term as successor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am indebted to the committee for extending the terms of reference to include an examination of the Whistleblowers Protection Bill. I can express nothing but the greatest satisfaction for the way in which the committee dealt with that report. The committee looked at the bill and took evidence on it from many different sources. A lot of the proposals covered in the bill were actually adapted or taken in a more appropriate form to be part of the recommendations of this committee report. In particular, I think the committee accepted some of the recommendations that had been made and then decided that further consideration was not required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very grateful because it is not very often that a private member's bill can get the attention of a committee. The major satisfaction I have is that my commitment to former senator Jo Vallentine was able to be completed in a highly satisfactory way. I believe that the outcome of the report is such that both of us can feel that we have been very involved in the process. We are very grateful that the outcome is even better than we could possibly have hoped for. I express my gratitude for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are members of the committee whom I feel it is appropriate to thank. I have already thanked the chairperson, Senator Newman. I thank the deputy chairs&mdash;Michael Beahan, until he left to become President of the Senate, and then Senator Shayne Murphy&mdash;and Senators Paul Calvert and Kay Denman. Working with them on the committee has been a pleasure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The secretariat are worthy of receiving our utmost gratitude. I thank Elton Humphery for all the work he put in. I also thank Yvonne Marsh, the principal research officer, Winifred Jurcevic, the executive assistant, Sue Irvine and Angela Stanley for their help during the inquiry stages of the committee process. They can all be very proud of the final outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we also should recognise the valuable contribution made by many whistleblowers, particularly members of Whistleblowers Australia and the Whistleblowers Action Group in Queensland, for their work during the course of the inquiry. I have already mentioned that the evidence of whistleblowers who shared their experiences was enormously valuable. I note also the contribution of Senator Coulter, who shared of his own experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference of the committee did not allow for the consideration of individual cases. This, I believe, created great difficulty because a lot of the information we were given was actually based on very painful and distressing experiences of people who had blown the whistle. We were not able to take up such cases because the committee was not empowered to determine the rights or wrongs of individual cases which were attracted by the inquiry. The function was to look to the future in respect of whistleblowing legislation, not to become an avenue for whistleblowers to raise their cases in the expectation that specific action could be taken. Accordingly, when advertising the inquiry the committee included the following comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the committee appreciates that there exists evidence which relates to personal and specific instances of whistleblowing the Committee will be confining its inquiry to the Terms of Reference . . . not be investigating or pursuing specific cases.</PARA>
<PARA>I think we owe a debt to those people. We were very concerned about the accounts that they gave and the lack of appropriate recourse that still exists. The Queensland hearings in particular raised matters which needed further inquiry and resolution. I believe that there is hope for such people in the setting up of the public interest disclosure agency process. But I regret that it cannot possibly meet the expectations and the needs that were expressed to the committee. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The committee made recommendations and tried to develop an approach to whistleblowing that would reinforce the positive nature of the contribution made by people who blow the whistle in the public interest. I commend the committee's report and the recommendations to the Senate. I also express the hope that the government will take this further and enact the appropriate legislation to see that the committee's efforts and those of the witnesses do not come to nought. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also commend the Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing on its excellent report, which I have had limited time to read. As Senator Chamarette has quite correctly said, the terms of reference did not enable individual cases to be spelt out. I refer particularly to the following recommendation made by the committee:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee remains concerned at the number of apparently unresolved whistleblower cases in Queensland and therefore the Committee recommends that the Queensland Government establish an independent investigation into these unresolved cases within its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>The concern I have is that the Queensland government in fact has a vested interest in not having these matters resolved because of prima facie offences associated with the cases which involve it. In fact, the allegations made by the Queensland whistleblowers involve the entire Goss cabinet between 19 February 1990 and 5 March 1990 and prima facie official misconduct within the CJC by high ranking officers now reaching to the Queensland magistrates' bench. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out at this stage that in no way does anything I say reflect on the integrity and character of Robin O'Regan, who is the chairman of the CJC in Queensland. I have known Robin O'Regan all my life and he is a man of the highest integrity and principle. He probably has some sympathy with the Labor Party, which is no reflection on him&mdash;it just shows that nobody is perfect. I point out that the concern of the Queensland whistleblowers is that with this matter being resolved within the Queensland government, it is a bit like Caesar making decisions on Caesar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, however, that the Senate committee's recommendation is a real catch-22 for the Goss government. I will explain why. This revolved around an inquiry into the Oxley Youth Centre in Queensland and the moving aside of a Mr Peter Coyne. An investigation was carried out by a retired magistrate called Mr Heiner. The investigation was closed down for apparently legal reasons&mdash;it was one of those legal messes that those of us who are not legal people cannot fully understand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened was this: the minister, Anne Warner, on 18 May 1993 told parliament that the Goss cabinet ordered the shredding of these documents `in order to reduce the risk of legal action' against the parties concerned. Minister Warner also informed the parliament on 21 May 1993 that cabinet allegedly followed the advice of the Crown Solicitor and the State Archivist. The minister's department&mdash;that is, the government&mdash;was officially informed on 15 February by solicitor's letter and fax of Mr Coyne's stated intention to commence court proceedings to gain access to the Heiner documents and tapes. Due and proper notice had been served on the government of foreshadowed litigation. She did not tell the parliament this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Union organiser Kevin Lindeberg, who gave evidence and who has been a member of the Labor Party for all or most of his life, officially informed Minister Warner's departmental chief executive, Ms Ruth Matchett, on 23 February 1990 that the unions&mdash;the QPOA and the QTU&mdash;would be supporting Mr Coyne's litigation. The notion of litigation was not challenged as something new. She knew of Mr Coyne's foreshadowed litigation in which the Heiner inquiry material was the central issue and item of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 February 1990, on exactly the same day, the Goss cabinet sought urgent approval to destroy the material only on the basis that it `wasn't required'. By law, cabinet was obliged to inform the State Archivist, a public official, of all the facts so that she could honestly and impartially carry out her public duties to protect public records in the public interest. That is the job of the archivist. To do otherwise, as occurred in this case, was to deliberately mislead a public official for cabinet's own gain&mdash;that is, to falsely destroy public records in order to obstruct justice. It would therefore appear to be a prima facie offence under the Criminal Justice Act and the Queensland criminal code. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Heiner inquiry documents and tapes were defined as public records. They had a legal status&mdash;and, importantly, legal value to Mr Coyne&mdash;and therefore, under the Queensland criminal code, should not have been destroyed under the circumstances unless the archivist was misled into believing that they were not required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public officials&mdash;for example, the Crown Solicitor and the State Archivist&mdash;are obliged to report official misconduct to a proper authority when they become aware of it. The Crown Solicitor is an officer of the court. He cannot engage, assist in or cover up the commission of a prima facie offence and nor can the State Archivist. The Crown Solicitor cannot act for the cabinet on this matter any longer, given the facts, because he would effectively be advising cabinet on how to address a prima facie criminal offence of which he had first-hand knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitutional and legal crisis can be forced from within the system itself either by making the Crown Solicitor a party to the offence or by forcing him to expose it. He cannot be allowed to sit on the sidelines. Mr Lindeberg has placed a comprehensive freedom of information application before the Crown Solicitor and he must know the prima facie illegality of the shredding. He must be challenged and forced out into the public to declare his innocence and the integrity of his office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Crown Solicitor cannot be party in any way whatsoever to a prima facie offence of attempting to or perverting the course of justice. Cabinet cannot seek independent legal advice away from the Crown Solicitor if he refuses to advise it because that would be using public moneys to cover up an offence. This represents core administrative and political corruption of the highest order. The concern expressed initially was whether the Senate recommendation will be effectively put in place for an independent investigation. A so-called independent investigation has already been carried out. It turns out that the person in question, a Mr Nunan, gave a report that stated that nothing illegal had been done. Mr Nunan was previously a partner of Mr Wayne Goss in the Caxton Legal Centre and has now been appointed as a magistrate. One must wonder about these things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are key questions that must be answered. Minister Warner stated that cabinet allegedly followed the advice of the Crown Solicitor. A fundamental question that must be resolved is: did the Crown Solicitor advise the cabinet to shred public documents required in foreshadowed known litigation in order to reduce the risk of legal action against all the parties involved, including the Crown? If he did, then he advised the Goss cabinet on how to commit a prima facie offence of obstructing justice. If he did not, he must be forced publicly to say so because he is an officer of the court and a public official and the Goss government is attempting to cover up its own offence behind a smokescreen of non-existent crown law advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was the State Archivist told in the letter of 23 February 1990 from the Goss cabinet about Mr Coyne's due and proper notification of the intention to commence court proceedings and that the Goss government wanted those public records destroyed in order to reduce the risk of legal action against all the parties involved? If not, she must report that she was misled in carrying out her public duties honestly and impartially. The CJC must be made to declare publicly that it is lawful that the Goss cabinet can destroy public records required in known anticipated litigation in order to reduce the risk of legal action against the Crown itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the basis of the evidence given by the Queensland whistleblowers. People have been hurt; people have been singled out for all sorts of intimidation. Mr Lindeberg has suffered enormously as a result of evidence that he gave before another committee of this Senate. It would seem to me that, even though I support strongly the recommendations of the committee, one would have to question whether the Queensland government will ever set up an independent investigation into these unresolved cases. If it does not, it is something that should be taken up by the Senate in the next few months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to offer several congratulations and a couple of comments. Firstly, I congratulate former Senator Vallentine on introducing into the Senate the legislation from which this reference arose. Secondly, I congratulate the Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing, under the chairmanship of Senator Newman, for an excellent inquiry and an excellent set of recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been a whistleblower, I was very keen to see this sort of inquiry get under way. Because I could be seen to have a very strong vested interest in such an inquiry, it was not one that I was keen to initiate myself. Therefore, I am particularly pleased that this committee was formed, that it has carried out a diligent inquiry and has come forward with some very good recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like briefly to pick up a couple of those recommendations and illustrate them by giving some examples from my own case. For over 20 years, I was a research scientist in South Australia. At the end of that time I was sacked for actions which involved whistleblowing. I think it is worth mentioning some of the facts because they bear very much on the likelihood of some of these recommendations being implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time I was working on the carcinogenicity of various drugs and various chemicals found in the workplace. I identified a new drug as one which was mutagenic and therefore potentially carcinogenic. This was not surprising because it was one of a class of compounds, several others of which had been shown to be mutagenic and cancer causing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I chose to attempt to publish this work in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia </EMPHASIS>to warn general practitioners that the drugs of this class should be regarded with some suspicion, because the original work on which the first drug of this group had been registered had been falsified. This came from a paper which had been published in the very prestigious <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> journal in 1976. The drug company, Searle, had been found to have very extensively falsified the research on which that first registration was based. I and a chemist colleague with whom I was working sought to include in our article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia </EMPHASIS>several paragraphs from the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> which drew attention to the falsification of those studies by Searle and to draw the conclusion that, therefore, general practitioners in Australia should review their prescribing practices with respect to all drugs of this class. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, I was told on two separate occasions by two different people that those already published paragraphs from the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Nature</EMPHASIS> could not be included in our article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Medical Journal of Australia</EMPHASIS> because the institute where I worked `received money from drug companies to do research'. I mention that particularly because on page xiii of the report the committee talks about the value of reporting wrongdoing and welcomes any initiatives, programs or strategies aimed at addressing this culture change. It was referring to the need to bring about a cultural change within the institutions in which the whistleblowers are working. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The events that I have just recounted occurred in 1980, at a time before the government was placing so much emphasis on research institutions such as CSIRO, the universities and so on getting 30 per cent or more of their funding from private sources. Even then the cultural pressure was on for those organisations to attempt to suppress important information because of the inhibitory effect that the publication of that information may have on the acquisition of funds from private sources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have difficulty in seeing, given the cultural change which is now moving in a direction different from the cultural change that the committee is recommending be brought about, how the hope that is being expressed by the committee can be realised. It seems to me that it is, indeed, a forlorn hope. Given the evidence that is now coming before the Industry, Science and Technology Committee in relation to CSIRO, in which a number of people are blowing the whistle on the suppression of very important information in CSIRO's possession, the government needs to review the pressure that it is applying, because it is inimical to the openness of science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn briefly to the principal recommendation, which is the establishment of the Public Interest Disclosures Agency and the Public Interest Disclosures Board. I warmly commend the committee for those recommendations. The committee has correctly identified a number of characteristics associated with the suppression of whistleblowing which mark this as a separate type of activity that needs to be investigated and judged by an agency which has some special knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Newman has already pointed to some of the characteristics of the spurious charges that are brought against whistleblowers, such as that their work is not satisfactory; whereas quite often their work is of exemplary and high quality. These charges have been used as excuses to dismiss people from their employment. There have been charges that these people are mentally ill or deranged in some way, and they are sent off to psychiatrists and psychologists and given extended medical leave and so on. There is a whole range of actions which are taken against whistleblowers and which mark them out as special cases. I am very pleased to see that the committee has made these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I sincerely hope that, as Senator Newman said, the government accepts these recommendations and acts on them promptly. It is a very important area. The integrity of scientific activity in Australia depends upon the honesty of science; it depends critically on scientists who feel that institutions and agencies are going wrong being able to make public their concerns and being able to make these disclosures without action being taken against them and, through that process, bringing about a return of those institutions&mdash;particularly public institutions such as CSIRO and the universities&mdash;to the honest road on which those institutions should be going in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the government should deal with these recommendations very seriously and very expeditiously because this is one of the mechanisms which will help to address that cultural shift to which I earlier referred and which I believe is moving the science and technical activity in this country in the wrong direction&mdash;a direction which is inimical to the public interest and certainly inimical to the interests of whistleblowers who might try to resist that force which government policy has placed upon them. </PARA>

I am glad to see that the committee was chaired by Senator Newman. I am glad to see her returning to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the recommendations have been made with a great deal of thought. Today, in this chamber, the committee has received a lot of deserved congratulations. However, I sound a note of warning. I have no doubt that the committee took this aspect on board. We live in a free and democratic society, and to a large extent that involves letting go things that in a totalitarian state would not be let go. There was a famous English judge in the last century who said that truth could be loved too much. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to dismiss the report in any way; it should not be dismissed because it is a great report. However, I want to sound a note of warning that if we encourage whistleblowers&mdash;and there are whistleblowers and police informers; most matters that the police investigate come about as a result of informers&mdash;there is the danger that we will become a society of people who spy upon our neighbours and report anything that we consider might be worthy of investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is danger that this sort of procedure can be used by people to do damage to others, either through a belief that they deserve it because of a particular perception that the whistleblower has of the action taken by the person informed on, or simply as a means of revenge or of bringing that person down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Public interest disclosure is defined as disclosures of illegality, infringement of the law, fraudulent or corrupt conduct, substantial misconduct, mismanagement or maladministration, gross or substantial waste of public funds or resources, endangering public health or safety, and danger to the environment. It is left up to the informer or whistleblower to make a judgment about that and then for the agency to decide whether or not that assessment is right. The agency makes that decision without necessarily having heard from the person against whom the allegation is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to sound a warning that, if whistleblower legislation is going to be introduced, it be introduced with a great deal of care because a great deal of injustice can be done to the people informed against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are becoming a society that is more and more intent upon bringing people to book, no matter what. While I have been in parliament, telephone tapping has been extended in an exponential way. Bodies such as ICAC in New South Wales have been set up. As I said yesterday, that body has been responsible for some great injustices&mdash;particularly to Mr Greiner, for example. The CJC in Queensland was criticised this morning by Senator Parer, for whom we must have great respect. However, I might say that Senator Parer has used information supplied by other people to criticise the Goss government. Whether that is right or wrong is hard to detect from what he said. That is again an illustration of how whistleblowers can lead to injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have this growth in policing powers. The NCA has been set up and we have had royal commissions into all sorts of things. But there must be a limit to this policing activity. I am inclined to think that, if we are going to introduce whistleblower legislation, it should be introduced with lots and lots of protections. My own view is that the legislation should not be introduced. I do not want the establishment of a society of informers. If the majority of people in the parliament believe that it should be established, it ought to be introduced with a great deal of circumspection. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to speak on the report of the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing because I have not yet read it. I wonder whether Senator Cooney has had the opportunity to do so, given that the report has only just been tabled. However, I could not sit here and listen to what Senator Cooney had to say without putting a couple of comments on the record to balance the comments that he made about what could be called vexatious whistleblowers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that there are some people who might want to undermine somebody in an academic department, in a government department or in a police force&mdash;for ends that are not the exposing of real corruption or other problems such as falsification of data, but to undermine that person's professional career. I think the committee was very conscious that that sort of thing can happen and that there are those sorts of people around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was really addressing situations where whistleblowers have real evidence, a real concern for the public interest and a belief that public moneys are being used fraudulently. I would like to put on the record some of the comments that the committee made. General observation 9.3 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The challenge for the Committee has been to devise a scheme which while ensuring the right of a person to report wrongdoing, also ensures that rights and freedoms are balanced. The Committee is aware that achieving the balance depends in practice on the protections which will be available under the scheme, not only to the whistleblowers, but to the subjects of whistleblowing.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Committee recognises the basic presumption of innocence, and seeks to ensure that allegations are investigated in such a way as to respect the fundamental rights of those accused of wrongdoing.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on in the report, the committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that where a person makes an allegation, knowing it to be false in a material particular, the making of such a false allegation should constitute an offence under the whistleblowing protection legislation. Where such an offence is proven, the person who made the allegation should be subject to a penalty being fine and/or community service orders.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also recommended that the Public Interest Disclosures Agency not receive disclosures or complaints made anonymously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the checks and balances that the committee has suggested will help to alleviate some of the concerns that I have and that Senator Cooney has about people being wrongly accused of fraud and whistleblowers being protected while persons accused of a crime are not.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday afternoon during the second reading debate, Senator Harradine came to me with a concern. As I said yesterday, I took over responsibility for the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) at short notice because Senator Herron is away in Rwanda using his surgical skills and medical knowledge to assist the people in that strife-torn country and is not able to be here for that reason. I took over the bill and was not as on top of it as I might otherwise have been. I wanted to have some time to look at the concerns Senator Harradine had. I went to the Deputy Clerk at the table and asked her advice in a rather hasty way. I do not think I explained what I was asking for very clearly. Therefore, her advice was most probably based on the way I asked the question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the duty minister, it is best that I read this information for the record. This is in response to Senator Harradine's proposed amendment, which he has now withdrawn. The information I am about to give puts on record the government's response. At present, the regulations which amend the general medical services table and the pathology services table are examined in the parliament under systematic scrutiny which applies to all regulations. The updated tables are incorporated in the Health Insurance Act each time there is a reprint of the act. The current reprint&mdash;only the third reprint since the act was passed in 1974&mdash;shows the tables as they existed through schedules 1 and 1A as of 31 December 1992. So they are a couple of years out of date; not 10 years, as Senator Harradine might have been concerned about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment seeks to omit the reference to schedules 1 and 1A in sections 4 and 4A because reprinting the tables and the schedules as at a point in time only duplicates the tables already scrutinised by the parliament in the form of regulations. Every few months the tables are updated through amendments to the regulations which occur from time to time, in addition to annual regulations which contain the entire tables.

I am informed by my advisers that, by being able to buy the act separately from the regulations, the public will be able to pay less for one or the other than having to pay for an unnecessary attachment of regulations at the moment, which is 140 pages out of 360 pages.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matters under discussion&mdash;the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill, the Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill and the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill&mdash;received some attention yesterday. In continuation of that debate, the Democrats' point of view needs to be expressed clearly. There is some degree of frustration, which I detected yesterday in Senator Tambling's speech, that there were recommendations from the government's citrus working group of the horticultural task force, both chaired by Senator Sherry, which we see no evidence of being addressed and followed through in this set of legislation, when it is appropriate that those recommendations could have and should have been followed through.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing that surprised me about Senator Tambling's contribution yesterday was that after being critical in that regard&mdash;and I agree with his criticism&mdash;he supported the bills. Perhaps a warning is being issued. If that is the case, then I would like to underline that warning and suggest that there are measures which this government can follow and recommendations before the government on which action needs to be taken in this area of horticultural levies and the whole business of sales tax and the arrangements that this country is entering into with regard to the results of the December 1993 Uruguay Round of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am glad to see that Senator Boswell has joined us, because of his particular interest in this. Also in question time yesterday I was reminded of his interest when he asked a very pertinent question about levels of heavy metal contamination in certain imported products, namely, peanuts and the international arrangements which would affect Australia in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to pay attention to what happens in Australia when overseas treaties and agreements are entered into. On the one hand, we see a great flurry of concern from some coalition members about overseas treaties and agreements and yet, on the other hand, we see quite a ready acceptance of the ramifications of GATT which, if anything, is a huge overseas treaty or agreement. It is the general agreement on tariffs and trade and it is very international. I would like to see a little more consideration given to our acceptance of that and its ramifications in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this area we heard mention yesterday, and again through Senator Tambling's speech, of the effects that would be felt in the citrus fresh fruit juice area. The fact is that, until now under the local content arrangements for all fruit juice drinks, if the drink contains 25 per cent or more local juice, either freshly squeezed or from local concentrate, then sales tax is levied at a rate of 11 per cent. If there is less than 25 per cent local juice, then sales tax is payable at 21 per cent&mdash;and `local' is defined as Australia, New Zealand or Papua New Guinea. But as a result of the December 1993 Uruguay Round of GATT, the local content arrangements will be abolished from 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the questions that should be considered carefully is the degree of compliance with the 1993 Uruguay Round of GATT by other countries and whether Australia is again leading with its chin internationally, and I am sure Senator Sherry knows exactly what I mean. Is it proper; is it in Australia's best interests to lead the charge against our own local producers, against the interests of Australian domestic trade before determining whether our other competitors in that area will comply with the letter of the agreement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting in any way that Australia should welsh on its international agreements. But I am suggesting that a degree of circumspection be applied to the decisions we make in this area and that we check out the moves of our competitors before we rush headlong into what we believe is necessary for compliance. I might make it a little clearer by saying that the recommendations of the citrus working group of the horticulture task force do express some caution and suggest that the government take compensatory action before applying compliance with GATT. That compensatory action of exemption of fresh orange juice from sales tax et cetera is available to the government and should be followed through before we comply with the other constraints upon our domestic trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other actions that the government can take dealing with the definition of fresh orange juice or fresh citrus juice, can be taken without contriving to avoid the GATT agreement but to the advantage of our own producers. I share Senator Tambling's concern that those steps are yet to be taken and could and should be taken as early as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One other matter I would like to raise that I noticed was an important part of Senator Tambling's contribution&mdash;and while this was an aside, it was a very important aside and should be picked up&mdash;is the interpretation given by the Australian Taxation Office of a new tree planting. The Industry Commission report into this area asked the Taxation Office to change the way that new tree plantings are treated as capital expenditure by the Taxation Office, and to recognise that new tree plantings are maintenance of the productive capacity of an agricultural pursuit which in many ways form a parallel to the plantings, prunings and horticultural pursuits in other areas and should not be a penalty for those wishing to enter the industry and add to Australia's productive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Industry Commission report has not been acted upon, and Senator Tambling sought to stir things up a little by suggesting that that would be a step the government could take. In fact, over two years ago I wrote to all of the representative bodies of the Australian horticultural industry that were concerned with fruit trees and their plantings and suggested that very matter. I give notice to the coalition that the Democrats would welcome and support any such move to include Senator Tambling's suggestion in an amendment to whichever bill we can amend to clear up this matter. As a result of my writing to those representative bodies, we received considerable support for this move. Although I would not claim responsibility for provoking the Industry Commission to consider it, we welcomed that consideration and support the commission's recommendation. In case anybody thinks the Democrats have gone completely over the top by supporting an Industry Commission report, on its merits it is a good recommendation and it seems logical to us. So they are the areas of concern to us arising from this particular bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The central thrust of the bill, which I have not yet addressed at all, allows an increase in the levy, is worthwhile in itself and receives our full support; but I took the opportunity to raise those associated matters. I remind the Senate that, essentially, we are warning that GATT has implications that have not been properly addressed or considered; but they can be resolved much more favourably to support our domestic citrus industry. The government should be moving on that much more quickly than it is and we support the coalition's concerns there. We also support the coalition on the treatment of new tree plantings. So we find ourselves in a situation of supporting the bill but wanting to find a vehicle to express concerns. I have done that and I hope the minister takes the concerns into consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill 1994, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Amendment Bill 1994 and the  Horticultural Export Charge Amendment Bill 1994 which are being debated cognately. The Horticultural Levy Amendment Bill broadens the base of the levy by imposing levies on prescribed amounts of leviable horticultural products of a certain class presumed to be produced in Australia. Levies and charges are imposed on apples, pears, avocadoes, chestnuts, cherries, macadamia nuts, potted nursery plants, grapefruit and other citrus fruits, potatoes, onions, currants, sultanas and raisins.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levies are mainly paid by the producer. Levies on exported potatoes are paid by the processor and the exporter. The Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act governs the collection of the levies, which are apportioned between the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation. The changes to the levies have been requested by various industries, and the coalition supports the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives me an opportunity to address my comments to the horticultural industry, which is a great employer through the growing and processing activities attached to it. The industry directly employs 170,000 people. It is Australia's largest employer, directly and indirectly. For this reason, the horticultural industry needs some of its problems attended to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many years, the industry has borne the brunt of the highly corrupt and subsidised world prices, which have made its life difficult. Various horticultural industries had to contend with expensive anti-dumping cases, as prices were lowered considerably by the importation, and threat of importation, of subsidised fruit. In particular, after many years of price damage, the pear and cherry industries were successful in anti-dumping and countervailing actions against subsidised fruit from the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fortunately, amendments to our anti-dumping rules&mdash;following a Senate inquiry which I initiated&mdash;have enabled some successful anti-dumping and countervailing actions, but they come only after there has been a lot of financial damage and high cost to the industry arising from bringing proceedings through customs, the Anti-Dumping Authority and possibly the courts. This is unlike some other countries where the government funds the actions of the industry. In practice, Australian industries&mdash;even after a successful action&mdash;cannot sit back and plan, based on imposed duties that have been proven and granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example is the tomato industry. After a 15-month process that cost the industry a six-figure amount, dumping and subsidies were proven against Thai and Italian tomatoes. These duties were supposed to apply for a period of three years. This was increased to five years after amendments which were recommended initially by the government and the Senate inquiry. However, the industry has not been able to do its necessary planning unthreatened by dumped and subsidised tomatoes coming into the Australian market, because further actions within the duty period have been brought by importers. The Australian tomato industry finds itself again having to collect its evidence and resources to fight these further actions to remove the dumping duties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The focus of the industry has to be directed towards anti-dumping. If much of the industry's manpower goes into this task, the direction is taken away from marketing, growing and exporting and focused on mounting an anti-dumping case. Australia is one of the few free markets in the world into which other subsidised countries can dump their oversupply of tomatoes and other produce. We have negligible tariffs and are a very attractive destination. By contrast, the United States has a 100 per cent tariff on imported tomatoes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will illustrate the plight of the tomato industry. Duties were imposed in 1992 after dumping and subsidised imports were proven. The duties were revoked in June 1993,  while the industry had to address itself to a challenge to the duties from Australian-based processors and supermarkets. After the dumping and subsidies of produce from overseas countries into the Australian industry were found to still exist, the duties were reimposed retrospectively to February 1993. However, there has been a further challenge to suspend the duties, and the Anti-Dumping Authority is due to reach its decision on 19 September. In reality, for the whole time the duties have been imposed after a successful case, the Australian industry has had to devote itself and its resources to fighting challenges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), who is responsible for these matters&mdash;and he is in the chamber at the moment&mdash;is taking note of this. He would agree that this is no way to run an industry. Industries need to establish prices with growers. They need to make continued capital investment in their future. Generally, there must be a process to control continual appeals, particularly if they are frivolous and for the wrong reasons. The government devotes resources to encourage Australian industries to value add and export. No honourable senator would disagree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian canned fruit industry has a 30-year history of exporting Australian produce. It is a proud history. But the industry requires certainty. Senator McMullan has just released a report on food and agricultural opportunities in South-East Asia. The report speaks in glowing terms of the opportunities for a fairly huge increase in our share of the South-East Asian market over the next two decades from the current 7.5 per cent to a figure which would lift our export earnings fivefold&mdash;from the present $1.2 billion to $7.7 billion in the year 2010. It is an ambitious plan that everyone would support. Australian industry wants desperately to play a part in such efforts and progress. But when it is continuously being belted over the head by constantly fighting dumping duties which put returns in doubt, it is very difficult to plan for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example of the hardship of Australian industries is that they suffer before relief can be sought under the Australian system. This is happening to the pineapple industry in Queensland. The world is presently oversupplied and glutted with pineapples. In Thailand&mdash;which is our main competitor&mdash;every factory suffered a loss last year ranging from $2 million to $10 million. This means that there are a lot of pineapples available for dumping into the free market of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of food services, the Australian market is being oversupplied by this dumped product. At the same time, the Australian pineapple industry had to suffer material injury for three years before it was worth its while to bring an action under our anti-dumping laws. This is massively unfair, not only to the producers of the pineapples but also to the 1,300 unionists who work in the Golden Circle pineapple factory. When the parliamentary secretary addresses his reply, I ask him to consider not only the pineapple growers but also the 1,300 unionists&mdash;who basically all come from the electorate of Lilley, Mr Wayne Swan's electorate&mdash;who require some consistency in their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Customs has advised that three years damage is the required period before it will accept an anti-dumping case. When this is the Australian requirement, it is an open invitation to dump products. Most importantly, what untold damage must be suffered by an industry before action can be taken against the GATT illegal practice of dumping? By contrast, when the only pineapple factory in the US, in Hawaii, made a $24 million loss last year, the US government immediately acted and imposed a 138 per cent tariff or duty on imported pineapples. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy may be able to address how the US government was able to do that under the GATT commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US industry got immediate relief with massive tariffs while the Australian industry has to sit out its obligatory three years on the sidelines to enable it to meet Customs requirement of three years of material injury. Even then, after having suffered, an expensive process must be commenced by the industry through Customs and Anti-Dumping Authority hearings&mdash;maybe like the tomato industry&mdash;all the way to the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, especially the National Party, enthusiastically supports the export opportunities in South-East Asia and elsewhere that the government promotes. The coalition of the National and Liberal parties enthusiastically supports the notion of value adding for our Australian rural industries, but the coalition also knows that the rhetoric and the good intentions are not translating into reality. It knows about the problems suffered by our processing industries when dumped and subsidised products can very easily enter our markets, and how for years dumped products have unfairly done irreparable harm to our growing canning industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very few in this parliament would not accept that GATT is going to be beneficial to Australia. But to put our complete faith in GATT, and to be completely pure, is not going to solve the problems of some of these industries. We have to tighten our anti-dumping laws. We cannot allow our producers, our unionists, our farmers and our canners to cop three years of damage, of harm and hurt, while they fulfil a mandatory obligation in order to be eligible to make a claim for damage that is recognised by Customs, the government and the Anti-Dumping Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems have to be addressed, because the government has put great reliance on our food producing industries. As I said earlier in my speech, they are the biggest employer of Australians. We cannot walk away from it. We have to look at the damage that is being done and, within the confines of GATT, find some resolution that will solve the problems for these industries. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These bills deal with amendments to three acts that relate to the levy system that we have for funding both the Australian Horticultural Corporation and the various R&amp;D corporations in the horticultural industry sector.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debate has been broader than the specific references pertaining to this legislation, and I do not criticise that. I think there are a number of significant issues related to the horticultural industry that have been drawn to the Senate's attention, particularly by Senator Panizza, Senator Bell and Senator Boswell. I will comment on and summarise a number of those issues that other senators have dealt with in a very constructive way. They include issues such as the citrus industry, and the immediate concerns facing that industry; our dumping laws; and GATT and its ramifications for Australia and the horticultural and general agricultural sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, this legislation has come to the government and into the Senate at the request of the industries concerned. I think it is important to emphasise that. It is not the government that is saying that we should impose a new form of collection points for the levies; it is the industry that has come to government and said, `Look, it is not practical, given the current levy mechanisms, to collect levies in our industries because of the method of collection.' The gut of the government legislation is to provide for varied forms of collection of the levies, such as the number of trees, shrubs, plants, bulbs, corms or tubers under cultivation, and to use the presumed yield in these areas to calculate levies in those industries that request the government to apply the levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a number of meetings in the past 18 months with the two industries concerned, the nashi industry and the strawberry industry, in my capacity as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy with some specific responsibilities in the horticultural sector. These two industries have</PARA>
<PARA>said to the government, `We would like as an industry to consider a levy system. However, we don't believe the current levy mechanisms are practical for our industries, so we would like alternatives to be available should we come to the government to request levies to be made.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation has the support of all the parties in the Senate, and I thank the parties for that support. I have already mentioned that it is industry that is requesting that the levy mechanisms be varied. But there is another step in this process. The industries themselves then have to decide whether they want a levy collected. Certainly, the two industries that have sought amendments to the way in which levies are collected, the nashi industry and the strawberry industry, have been discussing the collection of levies for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to emphasise to the Senate that again it is not government that comes to the nashi industry, the strawberry industry or, for that matter, other industries that are levied, either for the Australian Horticultural Corporation or the various R&amp;D corporations. It is those industries, having been involved in a very lengthy consultative process with their constituent organisations, who say to the government, `We would like to be levied in these two particular areas.' I suppose one of the difficulties we have is that it is, in my experience, almost impossible to get 100 per cent unanimous support for a levy system. But the government policy in this area is very clear. It does require a significant majority of the industry to approach the government to seek a levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to say that this requirement for a significant majority in respect of the levy system we have for the AHC and R&amp;D corporations has bipartisan political support. However, as I have said, on occasions it is very difficult to get 100 per cent support. For a variety of reasons, some segments of industries in respect of which levies are currently being collected, or it is proposed that levies be collected, do not want levies collected. It can get quite complex as to why they do not want levies collected. I have found from experience that there is less controversy about the R&amp;D levy than there is about the levy to the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the R&amp;D area, the federal government provides dollar for dollar matching funding. So, where an industry voluntarily requests a levy, the government will match that with dollar for dollar funding. There has been some criticism of late&mdash;we believe it is incorrect criticism&mdash;that the federal government has not been committed enough to research in the agricultural sector. That criticism has particularly focused on the CSIRO. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have debated that before. I just want to highlight the significant contribution and commitment that this government has made through the R&amp;D levy system. If an industry says it will help itself through a levy mechanism, this government, which initiated this provision, will provide dollar for dollar matching funding. Certainly, during the time that I have spent with the horticultural industry&mdash;it has been a lot of time in the last 18 months&mdash;I have found it to be very appreciative and very supportive of this system. In relation to the levels of funding in the agricultural sector as a whole&mdash;without going into the argument about whether the CSIRO gets enough money, the corporations get enough money or state governments are providing enough money&mdash;generally the federal government commitment to R&amp;D has increased significantly over the last 10 years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the AHC, the government takes the view that it is necessary to have a national horticultural corporation to provide a national focus for what is a very dispersed and, generally speaking in terms of the representation of horticulture, not a particularly well-organised industry, with some few exceptions. There are over 100 different horticultural commodities. Very few of the horticultural commodities have their own national organisations to speak for them nationally. Very few of them have the resources to support the very necessary commitment that is needed to represent the horticultural sector, particularly in the international arena and particularly when it comes to a variety of issues such as quarantine access to a number of our markets or potential markets. The AHC plays a very important role in these access discussions, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Austrade, grower organisations themselves and the various ministerial representations that are made. Obviously, my minister, Senator Collins, participates in that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an industry sector where the industries are widely scattered, have not had a significant export focus&mdash;with a few exceptions&mdash;and are not particularly well organised, there is a need for an Australian horticultural corporation. I stress again that the levies are collected at the request of the industries which participate in the Australian Horticultural Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, I say that it is not possible generally to get unanimous support. However, the government has taken the view that where there is a significant majority it will accede to the request of a particular industry to levy it for the Horticultural Corporation. As we had in the research area, although not in the same way, the Commonwealth makes a direct grant of moneys to the Australian Horticultural Corporation to assist it to carry out its responsibilities. So, whilst it is not dollar for dollar matching in funding, it is a significant commitment of millions of dollars to assist the Australian Horticultural Corporation in its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Horticultural Corporation does not have responsibilities in just the international arena. It also has responsibilities, for example, in respect of the citrus industry in domestic promotion. That is particularly important. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Boswell acknowledges that. It is particularly important that these activities occur where industry requires them. It is particularly important to have generic promotion. The Horticultural Corporation provides very important assistance to industry in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me take up a point that was made by Senator Boswell. Where we are faced with the imports of not just horticultural commodities but other forms of agricultural commodities&mdash;I may touch on the dumping laws a little later&mdash;it is particularly important that we have active promotion of Australian products within the Australian market to highlight what I think is certainly their superior quality. For example, the citrus industry offers superior quality in terms of presentation, colour, flavour and, generally, growing methods. It is very important that Australian consumers are aware that there is a choice between an Australian product and an imported product. It is very important that the Australian Horticultural Corporation is involved in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The levy system is not without controversy. As I said earlier, it is not possible to get 100 per cent support. This brings me to the criticisms that were made by Senator Panizza and, I think, Senator Margetts that there is a view in some sectors of the horticultural industries in Western Australia that, for example, their local regional interests are not taken into account sufficiently within the national levy system that currently operates both for the AHC and the various R&amp;D organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not a view that is accepted by this government. We believe that it is very important to have a national perspective. We also believe that a national perspective must be projected both into the international arena and the domestic market and that, where appropriate, that national perspective can accommodate regional diversity. It is unfortunate at times that some regions within Australia believe that, if levies were collected locally or returned to them locally, they could carry out all of these tasks by themselves. The government does not believe that is possible. We do not believe it is possible for smaller regional organisations to project themselves, particularly in the international arena, without the very significant support of a national organisation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simply not possible financially, particularly for regional organisations, even if the levy were returned to them, to go out into the world market by themselves and carry out, for example, the necessary quarantine negotiations. Governments internationally do not recognise regional bodies. When it comes to quarantine issues, national organisations have responsibility for market access. I have pointed this out to the citrus industry and particularly to the apple industry in Western Australia and in my home state of Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Horticultural Corporation has an active role to play in this area. Senator Boswell raised the fact&mdash;I think it is quite critical&mdash;that the GATT negotiations and the phyto-sanitary outcome, on balance, provide significant advantages for Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was talking about phyto-sanitary conditions and the need for scientific assessment. That is overwhelmingly to Australia's advantage. For example, if the citrus industry is to survive in the long term, it is recognised that it needs to move away from a heavy reliance on juice towards a greater whole fruit export component. One of the critical areas to address is access into many of the Asian markets&mdash;for example, Korea&mdash;where, frankly, phyto-sanitary conditions have been used as a barrier to trade. It is the scientific assessment of these provisions under GATT that will be of vital advantage to Australia in obtaining market access to a whole range of areas, not just for citrus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as Senator Boswell has acknowledged&mdash;I think quite rightly&mdash;that that will mean that Australia will have to be vigilant in this dumping area because it is increasingly possible for other countries to export their commodities to Australia for a variety of reasons. It is not possible with the banana industry&mdash;with good reason. We have to be vigilant about the spread of such diseases as black sigatoka. I think it will be a long time before that particular problem can be overcome and we will see the importing of bananas into Australia. One of our effective weapons is vigilance with our anti-dumping laws. Senator Boswell, I think very effectively, has dealt with the issues needed to be dealt with there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by thanking honourable senators for their contributions. The citrus industry package, particularly the sales tax issue, will be going to cabinet shortly. The minister is formulating a package that will go to cabinet in the next couple of weeks so there should be an announcement on the matter because it has been raised in this debate. It is certainly of critical relevance to the growers and exporters. In fact, I had a meeting with the grower representatives on Monday of this week, so I am particularly aware of the issues that need to be addressed there. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza for his question. I did not deliberately omit reference to that in my speech; it was just that there were so many areas to be covered in this debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, I would make the point that the two industries concerned, the nashi and strawberry industries, came to the government with this suggestion; we are not suggesting it. They believe that the current levy mechanisms are impractical. They have suggested to the government that, should it decide to go ahead with the levy&mdash;we do not have that agreed to yet&mdash;they want this considered as a mechanism for collection of levy, should they decide to go ahead with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to both the strawberry and the nashi industries to identify to the government the detail of the collection in this area. I can say very clearly on the record: the government will not be employing inspectors. I think Senator Panizza last night expressed grave or significant concern that this would require inspectors to be employed, going around the paddocks and investigating people's yields. We certainly believe that that would be impractical. It is up to the industry to indicate to us how this can be done&mdash;how a levy can be collected through a simple measure that does not require additional bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited the nashi areas in northern Victoria where I met with some nashi growers who discussed this issue with me. For example, nashi growers believe that the statistics and knowledge that are available on the output within the nashi industry&mdash;which has confined production areas and a relatively small number of growers which is not likely to increase, at least not significantly&mdash;allow them to collect a levy in this area effectively without the need for any increase in the bureaucratic mechanisms, such as inspectors, et cetera. They feel that, with their knowledge of the industries and with the industries being of sufficient size, they are able to make that assessment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, the industry itself believes that this is an appropriate optional mechanism. It is certainly not an option that I think we could use, for example, in the citrus industry. The citrus industry is much bigger. It is a huge industry, worth $280 million a year, widely dispersed and with thousands of growers. It would be impractical to apply levies in this way. The government is certainly not considering it nor does it have any requests from industries like the citrus industry, the apple industry or whichever industry to do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) for what he has said but I cannot commend him on it. He still has not convinced me in any way whatsoever how the levy will be enforced. If we take the experience of other industries, like the wheat industry, for instance, its levy is collected at the point of sale.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, if a farmer uses his own wheat for his own cattle feedlot, he still has to pay the levy. Senator Coulter can shake his head, but it is in the act and if he looks at it he will see that. Inspections are carried out to see whether that is being done. In this case the system is further opened up by the fact that the levy is calculated on presumed yield. So it is presumed that the grower tells how much he has planted and it is presumed that all the nashi growers will cooperate&mdash;there could be a renegade growing his own fruit and selling it into the central markets. There are all those things to consider. This system is based on presumption, presumption, presumption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this legislation is passed&mdash;and it has the support of all parties&mdash;it has to have teeth. Why have an act of parliament that does not have teeth? The parliamentary secretary has not convinced me that it will. This is not an industry that I am involved in, or particularly want to be involved in because it has even more problems at times than the one I am involved in. I just cannot see how the situation is going to be enforced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I presume that the government is dinkum about this levy, or has it rushed into it without really thinking it out? The parliamentary secretary says that the nashi industry is only a small one and that this system could not be used with the citrus industry because it is too big. One day the nashi industry may be big, but he has already admitted that the levy would not work if that happened. Will the parliamentary secretary give an undertaking on behalf of the government that this method of collecting levies will not spread to the bigger industries like wheat and wool?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I can certainly give Senator Panizza an assurance that we have not rushed into this. The method of levy collection has been under discussion certainly for the entire time I have been a parliamentary secretary and long before. In fact, when I visited the nashi industry last year its representatives raised this issue with frustration because they had wanted it dealt with for the previous four or five years. So there is certainly no rushing into the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give a couple of examples of current levy collection mechanisms. There is a wide variety of ways in which a levy can be collected. One levy on the nursery industry is collected on pots used because it is the simplest thing that can be identified. Clearly, levying every plant in a nursery would just be horrendous. That is why the industry has said, `We want to levy the pots. We know how many pots are sold in Australia because there is a relatively small number of wholesale suppliers of these pots.' It is not fail-safe, I might say. The industry itself has said, `We want to levy pots.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frankly, I have already answered Senator Panizza's question. The nashi industry has said, `We can't collect the levy on pots and we don't believe it is appropriate to go to the wholesale markets and collect from the wholesalers.' That is for the reason Senator Panizza has raised: it would be too easy to dodge the levy. The nashi industry has said what is possible in relation to presumed yield. I am only postulating here because the nashi industry itself has to come back and say what final form of levy mechanism it wants and it has to be in accordance with the regulations. The nashi industry may well look at last year's output of nashis, which is easy to calculate, and then use that as the basis for the levy collection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nashi industry is very different from the citrus, wheat or potato industries in terms of its production areas and the numbers of growers. There cannot be a presumption that it is the government saying, `You have to do it this way.' The industry has to come to us. It has had very lengthy meetings&mdash;I have been involved in some of the discussions&mdash;with the levy collection unit within the department and it is for the industry to indicate which particular form of levy it wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not here pre-empting what the industry wants. All we are doing is providing another option for the industry, which it has identified as being a likely method of levy collection&mdash;the presumed yield. If 50,000 tonnes of nashis were produced&mdash;I do not know what the figure was&mdash;it may then say, `We might need $1 a tonne. We need $50,000. We will divide that on a per capita basis amongst the growers.' It may well say that that is the way it wants to go. I do not know, but it is a possibility if we have this as an option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total size of the crop, if we use last year's presumed yield, is readily identifiable statistically. That is not hard to come by. The number of growers in the nashi industry would not be hard to determine, given that it is a relatively small industry by other agricultural standards. There is a very active association. Not everyone is in the association, but all the growers are known. There are not thousands of growers in the nashi industry; it is a relatively small number of people. So the nashi industry has said to us, `This is an option we would like to discuss with our growers,' and the government is facilitating that option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nashi industry has said, `We think this is an option that is cost effective.' It is not a matter of increasing costs. These industries do not believe that the current mechanisms, the pot mechanism or asking wholesalers to collect the levy at the markets on the number of cartons, are very cost effective. It is anxious to reduce the bureaucratic costs both to the levy collection unit and to the private sector itself. I have had complaints from wholesalers asking, `Why should we collect this levy for the industry and for government? It is wrong that we should be forced to collect this levy.' So one of the aims of this is to ensure a minimal, and in fact a lessened, role for bureaucracy, not a greater role for bureaucracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it is not a government suggestion; it has come from industry itself. It is the industry that is saying, `We believe we can formulate a levy that is effective both in terms of its enforcement and its collection cost.' If a grower is identified who does not pay the levy that is required under the mechanism, should the nashi industry want a levy, then there are mechanisms within the act to provide for enforcement&mdash;fines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure Senator Panizza that the levy collection unit is not going to get involved in a form of levy that does not provide for effective collection or enforcement. I have met with the levy collection unit on a number of occasions and have talked about this issue. The unit would just not enter into a levy system like that. The preconditions for a levy in an industry are that it should have significant majority support of the industry, that it be effective and that it be able, in the view of the unit within the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, to be collected and enforced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concerns that I expressed last night have been added to today as information has come to me from both the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association and the Western Australian Vegetable Growers Association. Whilst the parliamentary secretary mentioned the industry, we recognise that the industry is varied. It varies from one section of the industry to another and between states. I have in front of me a report on action taken and results of resolutions passed at the 1993 annual conference of the Apple and Pear Growers Association. It looked quite carefully at investigating and reporting back to the 1994 annual conference on the possibility of collecting a levy on a per acre basis. The levies management unit perceived problems with this method of collection. For example, the levies management unit would need access to the records of ownership of all land used for growing apples and pears.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have covered this pretty thoroughly. If they do not want it, they do not get it; it is as simple as that. The apple and pear industry has a levy. It is not based on the amendments that we are currently considering. It is irrelevant to the apple industry. Senator Margetts is quite right; it would be impossible to have a levy for the apple industry based on the amendments before us today&mdash;which we are not considering for the apple industry; the apple industry does not want it.

I might say that it is a very fine fruit, not superior to Tasmanian apples, but certainly a very fine fruit. If honourable senators have not had the opportunity to eat a nashi, I urge them to munch on one because it is a very enjoyable and healthy fruit. </PARA>

Before we adjourn for lunch and have our different fruits&mdash;nashis, bananas or whatever&mdash;I say to Senator Margetts that she makes a good point, but it is not relevant to this legislation. We are not going to change the levy mechanism in the apple industry. It is the apple industry's prerogative to suggest&mdash;and it does suggest&mdash;how it wants a levy collected. It is a different issue from whether or not a levy is collected at all. I do not think the current mechanism is in dispute for the apple industry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Returning to the issue of presumed yield, I take this opportunity to raise a concern in relation to possible regulations to give effect to this. The parliamentary secretary may be interested in this matter because I am sure that, if the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances finds difficulty with any regulations to give effect to presumed yield, the correspondence will end up on the desk of the parliamentary secretary. As deputy chairman of the committee, I flag with the parliamentary secretary the fact that the committee does have scope to disallow a regulation if the regulation has effect in such a way that it could unfairly discriminate against somebody in the plying of his trade or profession. Concerns have been raised on this head in a number of other cases in different portfolios.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I raise with the parliamentary secretary is this: it could quite foreseeably be the case that there is an assessment of presumed yield but a grower in a particular area disagrees with that assessment of presumed yield on the basis that his soil is not as fertile and he is unlikely to reach that sort of yield. It seems to me that it would be very difficult to draw regulations to give effect to presumed yield and at the same time meet those concerns. If those concerns are not met, if it is assumed there is a particular presumed yield which will apply across an entire area, it could well be that the regulation could be challenged on the basis that it could unfairly discriminate against people in the carrying out of their trade as growers. I seek the parliamentary secretary's advice as to how he thinks regulations can be drawn so as to give effect to this which would not fall foul of the regulations and ordinances committee. </PARA>

There are a number of points of contact, including the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, where this issue can be considered. The government goes through an exhaustive process in developing its legislation and regulations, taking advice, obviously, from the industry.

I am sure the committee would very assiduously take into account the views of industry when considering these regulations. That is not unusual; I am aware of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give a commitment that we will ensure that the nashi industry is aware that the chamber, as well as the regulations and ordinances committee, may have a particular concern and that it needs to ensure that the detail required for a cost effective collection mechanism that is fair and equitable is established. If that is not the case, the committee as well as the Senate will have the capacity together to reject those regulations.

That is not 100 per cent fail-safe, even though industries prefer that.

I was not talking about a single grower; I was talking about the concerns of an industry which is not opposed to levies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act Repeal Bill 1994. The purpose of the bill is to repeal the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. The customs tariff act 1980 was introduced to fund environmental monitoring and research activities associated with uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region of the Northern Territory, where the Ranger mine operated by Energy Resources of Australia is situated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This environmental monitoring and research was undertaken by the Commonwealth Office of the Supervising Scientist. That office was established as a result of the Ranger Uranium environmental inquiry and was charged to protect the region's environment from the effects of the uranium mining. As stated in last year's annual report of the office, the role of the supervising scientist is to collect and assess information on the effect of uranium mining operations on the environment and to develop practices and measures for the protection and restoration of the environment. The supervising scientist was also given the function of monitoring the mining operations and legislative regime to determine whether Commonwealth environmental requirements are properly implemented by the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The repeal of the customs tariff act is part of a package of changes which the government claims will streamline and re-focus the federal government's involvement in the Alligator Rivers region. Repealing the levy was conditional to obtaining an agreement by ERA to make an annual contribution to the monitoring and research undertaken in the area. The coalition does not oppose this bill. ERA has indicated its support and has agreed to contribute $1.5 million annually&mdash;index-linked and subject to review after two years&mdash;towards research in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no net financial impact arising from this bill as the $1.5 million loss of revenue from the scrapping of the export duty will be offset by ERA's annual contribution. The current levy had become an increasingly unfair impost on ERA because, with the closure of the Nabarlek mine in 1990, the levy fell solely on it. The other operational mine, Olympic Dam at Roxby Downs, is not subject to an equivalent levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also public benefits arising from the research carried out by the Office of the Supervising Scientist which are unrelated to uranium mining but for which ERA was compelled to pay. One reason ERA has agreed to the scrapping of the levy and to fund its own environmental monitoring and research is because it is optimistic about the likelihood of an upturn in the uranium market, resulting in its annual contribution becoming a less onerous burden than the existing levy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the anticipated increase in demand for uranium in the latter half of the 1990s, and with many other uranium producing nations exhausting their supplies and closing mines, there is no better time for the government to finally abandon its restrictive, illogical and misnamed three mines policy at its national conference next month. This restrictive compromise struck between Labor factions&mdash;which, in 11 years, has seen only three mining and export authorisations granted, one of which has since expired&mdash;has cost this country millions of dollars in lost income and lost jobs. </PARA>

If Senator Sherry wants to find out how much money was lost, I suggest he find that out through ABARE. Over the past decade the export income forgone is even more sobering. As stated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Register of Australian Mining</EMPHASIS>, a 10 per cent increase in market share would have generated $6 billion over that same period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has the world's largest reasonably assured uranium resources, with 30 per cent of the world's low cost uranium reserves, yet we provide only 10 per cent of world production. By comparison, Canada has 10 per cent of resources but supplies 30 per cent of the market. Canada captured this large market share by adopting an aggressive marketing policy during the late 1970s and 1980s, while Australia clung to its restrictive policy and missed countless opportunities to make similar inroads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's uranium export earnings for 1993-94 were $196 million&mdash;steady for several years now&mdash;but we have the potential to earn more. As the major industrialised countries, such as Belgium, France, Japan, Italy, UK and Germany, grow increasingly dependent on uranium for their power supply and yet exhaust their limited resources, Australia is perfectly placed to fill that need. Or it would be if the industry were not hamstrung by the government's three mine policy, which is now a virtual turn right policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Major uranium reserves have been located by various mining companies and several could be developed within the comparatively short term. ERA's Jabiluka project, now known as North Ranger and purchased in 1991 despite being placed on hold, is just one of these projects. In 1977, Jabiluka was identified as the largest and potentially the most economic uranium reserve in the Western World. Jabiluka, which was granted an export licence in 1982, had it revoked the following year by one of this government's first actions. That action would have resulted in the loss of many jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jabiluka project would make significant contributions to the economy during both construction and production, as well as foster direct and indirect demand for labour, capital equipment and increased export returns. Nuclear energy will play an increasingly important part in the energy mix which the world will need to meet the concept of sustainable development. Due to Australia's considerable resource base, Australia has the potential to become a producer of equal or greater status than Canada. Industry must be allowed to develop the reserves it has uncovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, in adhering to its discredited policy, rides roughshod over the wishes of the mining industry, the Northern Territory parliament&mdash;which only last week made a bipartisan call to the government to scrap the three mines policy&mdash;and the Northern Territory based Aboriginal groups which have long urged for more mines to be developed.

Senator Coulter is not going to have it both ways as far  as I am concerned. He is going to come in here and tell us that we have to spend huge amounts of money on Aborigines and then deny them the opportunity to develop their own industries. It is two bob each way. </PARA>

He cannot deny that because they have clearly come out and urged for a clear way for them to develop the uranium industry. The mining industry strongly supports nuclear safety, Australia's commitment to the international treaties which ensure non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and Australia's International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Uranium can be exported only to countries with which Australia has a bilateral safeguard agreement&mdash;that is, to other signatories of the treaty for the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.

We want to see how we can constructively develop and improve the growing relations between Australia and China and to see what further opportunities Australia has to add to this relationship. For example, China is the biggest buyer of Australian wool. Increasingly, as prosperity grows in China, China will be looking to cooperate with Australia in joint ventures for the development of a wide range of high technology products as well as cooperating in mining and a large number of infrastructure matters within China.

We had an excellent hour of discussion in which he spoke of the importance to China of establishing the rule of law in China. For centuries in China there was a rule of man; that is, in past centuries the emperor and his delegates, magistrates in various provinces, would determine cases on the weight of the evidence that was brought before them. They would determine what was the appropriate judgment, ruling or guideline in the various parts of China. It has been the tradition in other countries, and throughout our entire history in Australia, not to have a seemingly arbitrary outcome to judgments by governors and magistrates, whether at a national or provincial level, but rather to establish a rule of law which has been carefully considered and determined in a democratic process through an elected parliament, and to have the same law in currency in every part of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When he was with us Mr Tian said that in the modernisation of China, in the development of China that is currently under way, we must see the establishment more and more of the rule of law, and the people of China will demand an involvement in the determination of those laws. There will be a democratic process for the establishment of the rule of law. In the context of his discussion with us in May, Mr Tian then asked whether it would be possible to have a copy of Australia's Commonwealth law, so that they might have it as a reference and so that they could borrow good ideas from the experience of Australia. We enthusiastically responded to that by saying that we would do all that we could to arrange for him to receive a copy of a set of Australian laws. </PARA>

Accordingly, this morning the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department, Mr Stephen Skehill, with the six senators on the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, met with the Chinese Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Hua Junduo, and handed over to him four boxes that comprise all of the Commonwealth's law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk today about families and government economic policy. Before I do, I ask the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade whether he discussed with his guest yesterday the human rights violations in China. I am happy that Australia has given the PRC the laws under which we govern. I remind the Senate that yesterday a further example of the gross, continuing and probably more drastic violations of human rights that are occurring day by day in the PRC was revealed to us through an international human rights organisation. The organisation indicated that the organs of executed prisoners were extracted without prior approval or consent and that, in order to get them fresh, the executions were being botched.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That information came out yesterday and it was reported in the press. I would hope that, on occasions such as this, members of parliament might raise with senior PRC officials the absolute abhorrence of the people of Australia and its parliament when they are faced with those sorts of gross and continuing violations of human rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come to a much more mundane but, nonetheless, important question and that is the future of Australian families. Recently, I gave an address entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">First . . . do no harm: Families and government economic policy</EMPHASIS>. At the end of my speech today I will seek leave to have that document incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is not a long speech but it does have some information that I think might be interesting to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The admonition `First . . . do no harm' is important for governments, bureaucrats and parliament when considering the family. It is the admonition in the hippocratic oath to doctors. However, my concern is that governments are not asking themselves whether their policies are actually doing harm. They are not asking themselves: does the policy reflect the fact that the family is the fundamental group unit of society&mdash;with pre-eminent rights and functions not to be usurped by the state? Does the policy respect the principal of subsidiarity? Is the apparent need for intervention or aid being driven by other government policies having unintended consequences?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A government which attempts to solve economic problems of one kind of family at the expense of other kinds of families is doomed to fail. Governments should accept that different families will do things differently. Some families want or need two income earners, others one and a bit, and others will seek to get by with one income. Importantly, families, over their lifetimes, will move between having one or more incomes and between having or not having dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government taxes or subsidies should not be used to disadvantage those families in such choices. Governments should avoid social engineering, such as imposing de facto financial penalties on those who wish to undertake their own child care. The paradigm of victim, oppressor and rescuer may be quite naive when it comes to family dynamics. Families are complex organisms and using the coercive power of the state may often do more harm than good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Governments should not make it easier for men or women to desert their families or parents to evict their children. They should not make marriage burdensome by ignoring the income sharing function of families or by levying increased indirect taxes which bear more heavily on families. When we strip away the rhetoric about family support, family payments, home child care allowance, et cetera, we see a fiscal system which favours atomistic individuals without dependants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the combination of the wage, taxation and social security policies, most families are now working longer for less than was the case in 1980. As a trade unionist, and as a member of this parliament, I believe that this is an indictment on those government family policies which have that result: making families work longer for less. That is not a trade union objective, nor would I have thought that it was an objective of this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lest misunderstandings occur, I should point out&mdash;most would know this&mdash;that I have spent 40 years in the trade union movement and in public life supporting women in both the paid and non-paid work force. Indeed, as a union advocator, I was one of the very first in this country to obtain, through a tribunal, equal pay for work of equal value. My concern is for a truly free choice to be exercised without discrimination by the government. The problem is that the government is responsible for gross discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at an example in the document, `Let's Put Families First', by the Melbourne Catholic Archdiocesan Committee for the International Year of the Family. It looks at the case of two families, each comprised of a husband and wife with two pre-school children; each breadwinner falls $2,500 annually below average weekly earnings. Both families need another $10,000 per year to adequately cover their needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Family A decides that the mother should take a part-time job to increase annually their earnings by that $10,000. Family B decides that, for a number of reasons, including that the mother is unable to get a job, the $10,000 required is to be achieved by the breadwinner taking a second job, part-time, or by accepting the offer of a higher paid job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the tax/social security system, family A&mdash;that is, the two-income family&mdash;is better off by $4,819 a year or $93 a week. That is not chicken feed. Of course, what is not taken into account is the fact that family A also benefits indirectly from operational subsidies to the child-care centre of $21.25 per place, per week for one child under three, and $14.25 for the other child over three, plus capital grants for non-profit centres of $5,081 per place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically we now have a tax system which ignores the cost of dependants or, as I prefer to put it, ignores the personal redistribution of income which naturally occurs as income and is shared with families. Another disturbing trend is the move to increased reliance on indirect taxes and user-pays charges, which hit families harder than other taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that it is now difficult for many families to survive on one income. The larger the family, the less choice it has: with more children its needs increase and its capacity to earn decreases. Why should not a family be able to survive on one income? After all, that has been the policy for years in the Labor movement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that at many stages of the life cycle families will either want to or have to be in the one-income bracket. Many mothers, for example, want to spend more than 12 weeks with their babies and many families will not be able to field two wage earners. I will not give an example because I have one which is to be incorporated about two young marrieds and what happens to them over a life cycle. It is a very interesting example and I commend its reading to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must realise that the best policy for families is to genuinely empower them by not overtaxing them. Families are not empowered by becoming state mendicants. Empowering families means letting them support each other. It means not taxing an income shared by several as though only one person depends upon it. It is not necessary for a transfer from wallet to purse to go via the Treasury and the Department of Social Security. In fact, families were short changed by the process of cutting dependants allowances out of the tax system and replacing them with family allowance and family payments. The result is that since 1976 more than $20 billion has been filched by the federal government from the purses of Australian mothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The old British deed of covenant system&mdash;as I have got in the paper and I will have that incorporated&mdash;would be a better system. One person who undertook a legal obligation to pay income to another and paid it over in cash was allowed to transfer that income&mdash;to a specified limit, of course&mdash;to the other person for tax purposes. There is not much logic or commonsense in policies on families. Compared to single taxpayers, all families with children have seen a spectacular decline in their economic position over the last 30 years. The great majority of families have seen erosion or withdrawal of family allowance payments. In many families a wife has taken a paid job to help pay the bills and her reward has been a cut. We are told we have a problem with an ageing population and there is unemployment, yet the woman who decides she wants to raise children&mdash;that is, further taxpayers&mdash;is made to feel that she is a social drop-out. If she has a low income, she will get a parenting allowance. The much vaunted home child-care allowance is only $2.08 over the spouse rebate taken away from her husband. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are an increasing number of letters to the editor saying that is a three-card trick. In fact, it is not $30 a week that the mother&mdash;mainly the mother&mdash;or the carer is getting into his or her hands because the breadwinner is having the spouse rebate taken away. It is a net $2.08. It is worse than that but I would ask honourable senators to read the paper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will not have long-term, structurally sound prosperity whilst policy makers in Canberra continue to wage economic warfare on families. Australia will be happier when women and their husbands are economically free to raise families.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.2  Does this sober caution mean that there is no need for Governments to exercise family policies?  Of course not&mdash;but the spirit of policy must be based on respect for natural law.

Louis XV was complaining to Quesnay one day about how difficult it was to govern France&mdash;so many decrees to read and sign.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">What do we have?</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.1  The Parliament has statutorily expressed its view that the family is the natural and  fundamental group unit of society based on the institution of marriage as the union of a man and a woman voluntarily entered into for life. We would be denying our children their birthright if we failed to hold this concept up as the ideal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.2  Marriage used to enjoy the favour of the law. It does so no longer. The extent of the decay may be seen in the proposed<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Evidence Bill </EMPHASIS>which would make spouses compellable witnesses against each other in civil and criminal matters at the Court's discretion. How is the mutually supportive role of marital communication possible when we will have to add to the words of the wedding vows "and anything you say to each other may be taken down and used in evidence against you?"</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3  When we strip away the rhetoric about family support, family payments, home child care allowances et cetera, we see a fiscal system which favours atomistic individuals without dependants. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures on the tax/benefit position of households show that families pay their way on average. This holds even without taking account of how families with children are helping the Treasury by endowing it with its future taxpayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.4  Because of the combination of wage taxation and social security policies, most families are now working more for less than was the case in 1980. As a trade unionist and as a Member of Parliament, I believe that this is an indictment on those Government family policies. Lest misunderstandings occur I should point out, as most would know, that I have spent 40 years in the trade union movement and in public life supporting women both in the paid and non-paid workforce. Indeed as a union advocate I was successful in achieving one of the early breakthroughs for equal pay in this country. My concern is for a truly free choice to be exercised without economic discrimination by Government. The problem is the Government is responsible for gross discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.5  I take an example from "Let's Put Families First", by the Melbourne Catholic Archdiocesan Committee for IYF. The case is of two families, each comprised of husband and wife and two pre-school children; each breadwinner falls $2,500 annually below average weekly earnings. Family A decides that the wife should take a part-time job to increase annually earnings by $10,000. Family B decides that the additional $10,000 required could be achieved by the bread winner taking a second job (part-time) or accepting the offer of a higher paid job.</PARA>

Through the tax/social security system they are better off by $4,819 per year ($93 per week). Not taken into account is the fact that Family A also benefits indirectly from operational subsidies to the child care centre of $21.25 per place per week for one child under 3; $14.25 for the other child over 3; plus capital grants for non-profit centres of $5,081 per place. When all this is realised where is the true economic freedom of choice for the mother in Family B who wishes to care for her own young children in her own home. In a situation of high unemployment as well, it is crazy for Governments to deny a true freedom of choice which would have the added effect of relieving pressure on the labour market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.7  Basically we now have a tax system which ignores the costs of dependants or, as I prefer to put it, ignores the personal redistribution of income which naturally occurs as income is shared within families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.8  Another disturbing trend is the move to increased reliance on indirect taxes and user pays charges which hit families harder than other taxpayers. For example, having children generally means more water and electricity usage. Because families also spend more of their incomes, indirect taxes such as the petrol and sales tax increases and State franchise taxes tend to affect families more than most taxpayers. Many families get no compensation, not even the $150 low income rebate. "First . . . Do No Harm" is an apt instruction to Treasurers in this area!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.9   The fact is that it is now difficult for many families to survive on one income and the larger the family the less choice it has&mdash;with more children its needs increase as its capacity to earn decreases. And why should a family not be able to survive on one income?  After all, at many stages of the life cycle they will either want to or have to. Many mothers want to spend more than 12 weeks with their babies and many families will not be able to field two wage earners. Take a typical example of how the tax system adversely affects people over the life cycle. Paul and Mary are 20 and 19 and have just got married. She has a job at $18,000 and he is earning $20,000. Their disposable income per head after tax is $16,164 and tax per head as proportion of gross income is 14.93%. Ten years later Mary now has three children at home. She is not in a position to consider paid employment and both she and Paul feel that their young children have a right to have a parent at home. Paul has progressed and is now earning $36,000 (including regular overtime). The family's disposable income per head after tax and family payments is $6,012.30 and tax per head as a proportion of gross income is now 21.07%&mdash;it has risen from 14.93% when they were a two income childless couple. The proportionate tax rate has risen while disposable income per family member has been falling. Disposable per capita income has fallen by 62.8%  The family, because of Paul's work efforts, have now lost any assistance in the form of Additional Family Payment (FAS) and are substantial net contributors to tax revenue. Paul faces a tax rate of 39.9% on every extra dollar he earns to support the family. To discriminate against one income families as the Government does, is to eventually harm all families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.10The parenting allowance is only a token answer. Few families will be able to claim it and it has its own anomalies&mdash;Why for example does a parent with one child at home receive the same amount as one parenting 4 children?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.11We must realize that the best policy for families is to genuinely empower them by not over-taxing them. Families are not empowered by becoming State mendicants.</PARA>

Families were short changed by the process of cutting dependants' allowances out of the tax system and replacing them with family allowances/family payments. The result is that since 1976 more than 20 billion dollars has been filched by the Federal Government from the purses of Australian mothers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.13It would be much better for the tax system to simply recognize transfers of income between spouses and for their children. I have in mind not simple husband/wife income splitting but something like the old British deed of covenant system, where one person who undertook a legal obligation to pay income to another and paid it over in cash was allowed to transfer that income (to a specified limit) to the other person for tax purposes. This sort of approach could ensure that intra-family sharing of income was recognized and encouraged. The recognition of voluntary income sharing in the tax system would leave working families far less exposed to the sorts of cuts the Department of Finance has inflicted on family payments. It would be possible to have such a system side by side with existing family payments so that families not in the tax system did not lose while the majority who could support themselves moved out of the social security system. One parent families could also benefit by transfers of monies for children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.14It is, when you think about it, remarkable that marriage is the only form of partnership not recognized by the tax law though it precedes all other partnerships and is the foundation of civil society. Indeed, in thinking about marriage, we can think of it in tax terms as a partnership between the spouses and a trust for their children. Other partnerships and trusts are recognized for tax purposes but not marriage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.15Some social theorists seem to think marriage is outmoded and that it is a form of patriarchal repression and an instrument of gender inequality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.16Apart from the obvious insult to those millions of happily married couples who quietly get on with raising their families, these pseudo social theorists forget what happens when marriages break down. Women and children are not empowered by being left to fend for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.17The Treasury grows poorer as it has to find the money to do what used to be done gladly. When you look at social expenditures much of it is from the functional families to the dysfunctional. And as the burden gets greater more formerly functional families disintegrate under the economic pressure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.18How employment is to increase when families' spending power is being eroded further by increased direct and indirect taxes has not been explained. Even the Green Paper had to admit that  much of what labour market programs will do is simply to shuffle the deck of the unemployed. I don't regard that as a solution to unemployment. How justice or commitment to reduce unemployment is served by increasing the age when women can claim a pension from 60-65 is beyond me.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.19How unemployment is being eased when many women are denied the financial means to choose whether they wish to look after their own children at home is also beyond me. Indeed, the White Paper seems designed to push more women into the paid labour market, regardless of their preferences. There is neither parenting allowance nor tax equity for most one income families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.20Somehow there is not much logic or common sense in policy on families. Compared to single taxpayers, all families with children have seen a spectacular decline in their economic position over the last 30 years. The great majority of families have seen erosion or withdrawal of family allowances/payments. In many families a wife has taken a paid job to help pay the bills and her reward is a cut in family payments. We are told we have a problem with an ageing population and that there is unemployment. Yet the woman who decides she wants to raise children, that is, future taxpayers, is made to feel she is a social drop out. Only if she has a low income will she get a parenting allowance and the much vaunted home child care allowance is only $2.08 over the spouse rebate taken away from her husband.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.21There is a great expansion in subsidization of the paid employment of married women with child care centres being funded, child care fee relief and now a 30% child care cash rebate. The woman at home is really a second class citizen when it comes to recognition in cold hard cash. Indeed, the tax exemption for child care from the fringe benefits tax explicitly excludes the care of a child in his or her own home by a relative. Only the Canberra bureaucracy could dream up a definition of child care which excludes the care of a child in his or her own home by a parent. Whatever happened to the level playing field?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.22Yet to quote Professor Shirley Burggraff  "Before we embark on a program of paying everyone else&mdash;day care workers, foster parents, the juvenile justice system&mdash;to care for children on a massive scale (with taxes collected from families), shouldn't we, at least, consider the most qualified and interested parties for the job?  In a world where both men and women are free to choose how they invest their time and money, perhaps what the family needs most is a contract with society that provides some protection for return on investment."  Why should governments think that they can tax families with dependants ever more harshly without seeing fewer people volunteering to have children or look after their aged or infirm relatives?  The caring function of every family is valuable but recognition is non existent in the tax system and grudging in the social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.23Do the policy makers know what they are doing?  The closest clue I have found is in the Government's 1994 statement for the Cairo population and development conference. In that statement, the government admitted that Australia's problem was not over-population but an ageing population. It also stated that among its policies to cope with an ageing population was to increase further labour force participation by married women. Interesting, isn't it?  All this bureaucratic emphasis on labour force participation, which makes work almost sound like Nirvana&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">arbeit macht frei</EMPHASIS>&mdash;has less to do with women's real aspirations than finding tax fodder for the Treasury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.24One of the less attractive aspects of certain human behaviour is to get people to do what you want them to do by convincing them they want to do it for themselves or they would feel guilty if they did otherwise. It's called manipulation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.25Not only are women being made to feel guilty about wanting to stay with their babies at home instead of being heroic workers for the Treasury, they are even being made to feel guilty now for raising future taxpayers. We are being told that we must pay more for water, electricity and petrol to save the planet. And guess who is going to pay more than most?  Families with kids struggling on one income and getting no social security concessions. The push for greenhouse gas taxes and user pays for essential public services has more to do with revenue greed than the environment. Just ask poorer Tasmanians forced to pay more for leaded petrol when there was no evidence of a problem in Tasmania and when leaded petrol usage was going down anyway.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3There is much deceit and self deception in social policy. Governments want to buy votes by being seen to do something. The damage done by the taxes imposed to pay for those promises is rarely seen. At the same time, Government realize that voters may resent the pinch they cannot always see. So a lot of propaganda is put out on women in the workforce, on the environment or anything else to make women and their families think they are greedy, stupid, guilty or wasteful of the planet if all they want or expect to do is to stay home and raise some dinkum little Aussies. It is a sad commentary on Australian society that you are now regarded as a deviant by Canberra policy makers if you think a family should expect to be able to thrive on one income.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.1.0.6Superannuation is another burden being placed on those with families to support. Why should those who<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> are</EMPHASIS> raising future taxpayers be saddled with the same burdens as those who are not contributing to the future tax base?  Because they are not covered by the Government's superannuation plans mothers currently suffering economic discrimination by the Federal Government whilst caring full-time for their children will continue to suffer this discrimination throughout their retirement years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4Australia will not have long term structurally sound prosperity whilst policy makers in Canberra continue to wage economic warfare on families. Australia will be happier when women and their husbands are economically free to raise families. Children will be happier when their parents no longer dread their responsibilities or feel compelled to juggle them by putting infants in 9 to 5 creches. Families under pressure and disintegrating make for a very sad and long social decline.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take the opportunity today to refer to the official opening of the new Parliament House for the Northern Territory in Darwin on Thursday, 18 August. This was an important event. It was officiated at by the Governor-General on behalf of the people of Australia, and it very significantly draws a new focus to the self-government and eventual statehood ambitions of the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week in this parliament I gave notice of a motion in four parts. That motion was to congratulate the people of the Northern Territory with regard to their new Parliament House. It noted specifically that the historic opening was attended by more than 600 people, including a wide range of school children and residents of the Northern Territory and many officials and dignitaries who had a former connection going back over a very long time with the political developments in the Northern Territory. They came from all sides and all parties in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion recognised the significance of the building, which not only will accommodate the parliament itself but also accommodate 200 to 300 people working within the building. It will house not only the parliamentary chamber but also officers for ministers and members of the government and the opposition. It will include a state reference library and will provide facilities for a state crisis centre to coordinate relief operations. It is a twin building to the recently opened Supreme Court of the Northern Territory, and forms an important adjunct to what is now a very prominent and special state square in the immediate centre of Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth part of my motion last week commended local industry and tradesmen on the very high quality design and workmanship involved in the construction of this building. I was disappointed that I was not able to negotiate with all parties in this parliament for that motion to be declared formal last week in the normal process. I am pleased that the Liberal Party and the government indicated that they would have supported the motion had I been able to negotiate a formal position. However, due to the small- and mean-mindedness of the Australian Democrats and the Greens, I was not able to proceed with having that motion proceed as a formal one; and to have pursued a debate would have engaged this parliament in an unnecessary and acrimonious debate of what should have been a very prominent and special occasion. I think it is indicative that neither the Australian Democrats nor the Greens hold representation in the Northern Territory parliament. Judging from their action last week, I think it is indicative that they probably never will, so the new Parliament House will be a forum of a two-party system in the Northern Territory where, very obviously, there will be active and vigorous debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also disappointed that the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, delivered a snub&mdash;a calculated insult&mdash;to the people of the Northern Territory by not attending the official opening. Mr Keating would have been well aware of all of the development programs and projects that have been associated with constitutional development of the Northern Territory. My own relationship with him goes back to 1974, when Mr Keating was made Minister for Northern Australia. It was, in fact, his first ministry in the parliament. He and I, among others, entered into very formal and early negotiations for self-government for the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Prime Minister turned up in Darwin several hours after the official opening in order to attend the meeting of COAG the next day only highlighted his own personal situation in this regard. I must express the fact that I was very disappointed about that as so many other dignitaries on both political sides, including his predecessors in office, were able to attend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building itself, as I said earlier, will provide a very important focus for the Northern Territory and the future development of that area, particularly Australia's relationship with Asia. Members of the Senate would be well aware that the Northern Territory government alone among governments in Australia has a Special Minister of State for Asian Relations and Trade. This has built not only on the important memorandum of understanding between the Northern Territory and Indonesia, but also on the very wide work that minister, Mr Shane Stone, is undertaking throughout the Asian region on behalf of the people of the Northern Territory. I was very pleased to see that the consular corps from countries in our near neighbourhood were associated with the official opening, and were present on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The building itself provides the focal point. I hope the fact that so many school children of the Northern Territory were present means that in future they will all come to regard it as a premier building in which they ought to participate, just as they do in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. I think it is important to look at the five years that we have been in the new Parliament House in Canberra, and appreciate the additional resources that have been provided to members of the parliament and the competent functioning of this parliament during the five years. It not only enhances members of parliament, the clerks and the staff, but also provides a better form of government, just as this building in the Northern Territory will. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an historic occasion for the people of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are honoured that so many friends from other countries and States are here to share this moment with us.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today, the Governor-General will not just open an imposing new public building, but a building which displays the pride and confidence we Territorians have in our future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriately, he presides at a ceremony to inaugurate what will become the Seventh State Parliament of the Federation of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rest of Australia should be in no doubt that this building symbolises the determination of the people of the Northern Territory to take our rightful place as full and equal partners in the federation&mdash;and as strong participants in the advancement of our nation and our region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is much history centred on and around the site of this Parliament building, including the history of the struggle of Territorians for representative government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Once part of the colony of New South Wales, the Territory later became part of the colony of South Australia, then a territory of the State of South Australia at federation in 1901 and subsequently a territory of the Commonwealth in 1911.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is ironic that as citizens of South Australia in 1901, Territorians had greater participation in the Australian Federation than they did a decade later when the Commonwealth assumed full control of the Territory and revoked all parliamentary representation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1918, dissatisfaction with Commonwealth administration led to what is known as the `Darwin Rebellion' which drove the Commonwealth Government Representative out of town.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was not until 1923 that the Territory regained representation in Federal Parliament, but forty-five years were to pass before our single MHR was given full voting rights in 1968.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1947 the Territory gained its own Legislative Council&mdash;but it only had power to make ordinances and elected Members were outnumbered by Canberra appointees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fully elected Legislative Assembly replaced the Legislative Council 27 years later, in 1974, but still its powers were very limited.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The great change came in 1978 with self government, and the Territory surged ahead.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social and economic growth have been remarkable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Armed with an interim charter towards statehood, Territorians seized the opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In our sixteen year period of self-rule, the Territory has prospered despite the external constitutional constraints which have blocked many of our development options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This former backwater, which the rest of Australia had forgotten, has been transformed into a modern, progressive State&mdash;and is acknowledged as a leader in making friends in the dynamic Asian region which starts just over our northern horizon.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The record shows that here, like elsewhere, self rule turned local vision into growth, and new endeavour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued existence of this one sixth of all Australia as a Territory constitutionally inferior to the States is an anachronism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A long line of restless people, from both sides of politics, began agitating for Territory rights almost from the date when the Territory was split from South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were, if you like, the brothers and sisters of those from Australia's early colonial era who were first vilified and later applauded for their pursuit of the time honoured quest for political and constitutional rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What they fought for, and what they gained today are taken for granted, yet every Australian owes them an obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their quest became the force that built the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will complete the task they began so long ago only when the Territory's legitimate claim is acknowledged, when those who have the authority to transfer to the Territory the powers that the States enjoy, reflect and remind themselves about the true foundations of our national democratic heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we near the centenary of the nation's constitutional birth it will become increasingly inexplicable to those who observe Australian affairs that a nation which lectures others about equality and political rights itself does not practice that equality for all of its citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us consign to the dustbin of history the archaic situation where the people of one-sixth of the continent are governed on a basis different from the rest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would be a fitting contribution to the centenary of federation just six years away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It would display to the world the maturing of this one nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Then the federation catchcry of the 1890s `a nation for a continent and a continent for a nation' would at last be fulfilled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your Excellency, I thank you for your willingness to be present here in Darwin at this historic moment.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ADDRESS BY THE HONOURABLE BILL HAYDEN, GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA ON THE OCCASION OF OPENING THE NEW NORTHERN TERRITORY PARLIAMENT HOUSE, DARWIN</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">THURSDAY, AUGUST 18TH, 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a particular honour for me to be with you in Darwin today for the official opening of the Northern Territory's splendid new Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In any representative democracy, as we are blessed with in Australia, the opening of a new parliament house is a time for celebration by all people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an occasion on which we can speak with some pride of what such a building has to say about the nature of our society and the form of government under which we live.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is, for example, the sense of civic accomplishment&mdash;and all that the building expresses through its architecture and its physical presence about the community that constructed it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is certainly true that, while the Northern Territory occupies one-sixth of the continental landmass, the population comprises barely one per cent of the Australian total. Yet it is also a young population&mdash;a growing, a vigorous, an enterprising population. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A community that is taking advantage of the great opportunities the Territory has to offer in terms of its natural resources, its environmental beauty, its proximity to the markets or our Asian and Pacific neighbours&mdash;in particular to Indonesia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Australia at large adjusts itself to the economic and geographic realities of our place in the modern world, the Northern Territory is making a substantial contribution as a gateway to trade in commodities, in tourism and educational services, in sporting and cultural links with the region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a community, too, that very much reflects the multicultural dynamics that are so re-shaping Australian society&mdash;making of us a much more diverse, tolerant and interesting people. A more outward-looking, creative and successful nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And we see these things expressed in the self-confidence of this Parliament House, standing here with such assurance in the State Square project, reflecting the vitality of the community around it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It also reflects, naturally enough, the constitutional processes and developments that it is designed to serve: a unicameral parliament with seating for 25 members, although I see there is a future capacity for 40.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No doubt the designers had a growing territory population and the movement towards future full statehood in mind.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously I don't involve myself in that debate. But I do note that the constitutional arrangements of the Northern Territory have been continually evolving since the early days.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It has been administered at various times by New South Wales, South Australia and the Commonwealth, until the present form of limited self-government was achieved in 1978. Limited in the sense that certain state-type powers still remain with the Federal Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the constitutional arrangements of the Territory have evolved over the years, so have the buildings that housed your various legislatures, as speakers have reminded us today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They first met in an old second world war hut. There were times when members in the later building were surrounded by buckets catching the rainwater leaks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not anticipate there will be any problem of that in this building. It contains every modern facility for the efficient and comfortable functioning of parliamentary democracy. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For backbench members, for the committees, for the opposition and executive, for the officers of the parliament (it has one of the world's most advanced <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> recording systems) and, speaking of leaks, for the press gallery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Above all, there are the people&mdash;the men and women and children of the Northern Territory&mdash;whose interests the parliament exists to serve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They have access not just through the public galleries and the great hall, but also to the combined parliamentary and state reference library which is such a unique feature of this building among Australian parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ladies and gentlemen, a successful democracy depends not just on free and willing debate between the elected representatives of the people. It also relies upon a well-informed, critical and involved community itself. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One that is receptive to the clash of ideas and opinion, that is tolerant of differences, that is able to make a mature judgment upon them within the electoral process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An open, enquiring attitude; a commitment to the peaceful resolution of conflict&mdash;to the principles of justice and decency for all. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are the fundamental values of our society this building seeks to express as a parliament that is representative of the whole community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is why I say it is a particular honour for me to be with you today, and why this is an occasion to be celebrated by people everywhere.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May I therefore congratulate all who have been involved with the planning, the design and construction of this building. It is a worthy addition to the city of Darwin, to the Northern Territory, and to the democratic principles by which we Australians govern ourselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I offer my warmest good wishes to everyone who will serve here, now and into the future. In so saying, it is my great pleasure to officially declare open the new parliament house of the Northern Territory. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to raise the question of media manipulation and the `big lie', the latest experience of which we have seen in this chamber over the question of Cathy Freeman. She is an outstanding young Australian athlete of Aboriginal descent who&mdash;as I said the other day&mdash;has done herself, her community and her nation proud at the Commonwealth Games. That has been recognised and supported by the opposition. I want that to be understood right at the beginning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of deliberate media manipulation, and deliberate dishonesty, a clear impression has been created in the media that somehow the opposition is opposed to that recognition, is opposed to that support. I am particularly distressed about this because when I spoke about Cathy in this chamber I commended her, not only for her outstanding efforts, but also for carrying both the Australian flag and the Aboriginal flag. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet we now have a situation where AAP, and I complained about it yesterday, mistakenly&mdash;I heard that it was simply a mistake&mdash;referred to the coalition's opposition to a procedural motion relating to the suspension of standing orders. It related that to a non-existent opposition to the motion itself. The coalition did not oppose the motion. I am glad to say that AAP did in fact put out a report yesterday which accurately reflected what had happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I note that AAP at no stage said, `We were wrong.' It was, says I, looking up at the gallery. AAP was wrong, but it did not have the capacity to admit it. It simply ran the story again and quoted me saying what really happened. It is about time the media recognised that when they are wrong they should say so. All around Australia, media outlets repeated that false statement: that we had opposed this resolution supporting Cathy Freeman&mdash;we did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AAP kindly put out an article which, one could say, corrected its mistake without ever saying that it made a mistake and that it was correcting it. However, I guess it did not surprise me that not one of those media outlets ran the correction&mdash;not one. With all the false publicity and the mendacious attacks on us in the media&mdash;it was the subject of late night ABC talk shows and that sort of stuff&mdash;not one of the outlets corrected the false statements that were made and then spread around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a matter of regret, not simply that AAP was wrong, but that members of this chamber should have participated in creating that false impression. I put out yesterday a press release outlining what the facts really are. I notice that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper which, I understand, had been briefed by an adviser of an anonymous cabinet minister here&mdash;and briefed falsely, on the basis that we had opposed the motion&mdash;ran at least what I had to say about it yesterday. But then it referred it back to the anonymous briefer. I will actually read exactly what the anonymous briefer said, in the extract from the column. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was that anonymous Labor Cabinet minister's staff who gave us the story. Had we been duped? Back on the phone to ask them, using the "more disappointed than angry" voice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"Absolutely not," said the minister's adviser. "The Coalition senators voted against the motion `on the voices', but they refused to call a division because that would have meant their names would have been recorded. It was gutless."</PARA>
<PARA>That was the sort of stuff coming from a Labor minister's senior adviser. Either he did not know the facts or was deliberately and disgracefully doing his master's bidding in an attempt to blackguard us. It is simply a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is, as I outlined in a notice of motion today, had there been any opposition voices opposing that resolution, then the chair would have asked a very simple question, `Is a division required?' But there were no voices and, as a result, there was no request as to whether a division was required. Anyone who disputes it can listen to the tape&mdash;the tape of what actually happened in this parliament. There were no voices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet I have got a letter. I received this letter last night from Senator Meg Lees, and I must say that Senator Meg Lees has an interesting version of the truth. Senator Lees has put on an incredible performance in this matter, and I will deal with that in a minute, because she was the person who set out to misuse Cathy Freeman's outstanding performance for a sordid political point scoring exercise. Anyway, she has written to me expressing her concern and disgust at my notice of motion calling on her to tell the truth. She states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most appalling aspect of your Motion is the suggestion that I should "tell the truth"&mdash;in other words, you are implying that I am a liar.</PARA>
<PARA>I say `amen' to all that. Then she goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the final vote was taken on my Notice of Motion,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Senator Lees's notice of motion&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there was a definite "No" from your side of the chamber.</PARA>
<PARA>I have asked every member of the Senate on our side who was in this chamber at the time whether they heard anyone say `no' and whether they said `no'. There was no `no', unless I am getting deafer than I expect, and all my colleagues are afflicted with the same problem. There was no `no'. Senator Lees knows that. She knows it, and I believe it is an absolute disgrace that she would pretend in a letter to me, and presumably has extended the same pretence to the media, that there was. Then she goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact, I remember seeing Senator Campbell shaking his head.</PARA>
<PARA>That is right, because the whip looked at him wondering, `Are we going to do anything?' and he was saying, `No, we are not doing anything. We are not opposing it.' Then Senator Lees goes on with this brilliant conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only conclusion that can be drawn from this is that the Coalition opposed my Motion.</PARA>
<PARA>Now the only way people can come to that conclusion is either if they are are stupid or dishonest, because there are so many other conclusions one can and must come to. In fact, I will deal with that in a minute when I deal with the question of Alan Ramsey today. She then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you seriously expect people to believe that after spending more than an hour debating my Motion, during which your colleagues constantly declared their opposition for a variety of reasons, that the Coalition suddenly decided to support my Motion?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Less has been here long enough to know what parliament is all about. She has been here long enough to know that often oppositions seek to amend things and, if they fail to amend them, they are nevertheless prepared to support them. It happens all the time. All through the debate, we continually supported the thrust of the motion. Every speaker on this side of the chamber in that debate supported the thrust of the motion. We simply sought, in our view, to improve it. We failed to improve it. Senator Lees is pretending that, because we sought to amend the motion, we opposed the thrust of the motion. It is absolute nonsense; it is malevolent nonsense. It is nonsense and I believe it meets an agenda which I find absolutely disgusting. That agenda is to misuse Cathy Freeman for a political purpose. Of course, Senator Lees was seeking to do that when she put out another press release where she described people like me who supported Cathy Freeman's carrying of the flag. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will this group of red-necks also over-ride Coalition Senators who support the Government's proposed Aboriginal Land Fund?</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on about `arch-conservative Liberal Senators'. The fact is that we sought to improve&mdash;not oppose&mdash;her motion. Whether or not we succeeded, the fact is that we did not oppose the motion that was presented to this chamber. There were no voices against it. That did not prevent Alan Ramsey today from writing a mischievous and malevolent piece which fitted his agenda. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What followed was an unpleasant little episode&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This refers to what happened in the chamber when we discussed this matter. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nobody from the Opposition spoke in favour of the Lees motion; and, after rejecting the Opposition's attempt to amend it, the Senate approved it on the voices, with the Opposition declining to force a formal vote. It didn't want to be seen as voting against Cathy Freeman; it just didn't want to vote for her.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That's how rigid the Opposition still is on . . . anything smacking of Aboriginal rights, even if it's only the uninhibited delight of a young athlete flaunting her black heritage after winning a footrace.</PARA>
<PARA>He obviously did not know or did not care what actually was said in this chamber. He did not care that he was blackguarding people like me. In fact, that probably encouraged him to do so; it might have given him a special extra thrill. The fact is that we supported the thrust of the motion and I commend Mr Ramsey to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> before he writes any more dishonest, disgraceful tripe like this. I have written a letter to the editor of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald</EMPHASIS>. I hope it gets printed. In case it does not, I think I should put it on the record now. My article says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Alan Ramsey is just plain wrong . . . His grotesque distortion of the Coalition's strong support for Cathy Freeman into a concocted claim of opposition to her is intolerable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In fact large parts of the Democrat motion supporting Cathy Freeman were drafted by the Coalition, particularly the clause which `commends Cathy for her pride in her Aboriginal heritage and the inspiration and encouragement she provides to young Australians and particularly young Aboriginal Australians'.</PARA>
<PARA>That was framed by the coalition. We consistently supported it. Yet Ramsey has the `integrity' to say nobody from the opposition spoke in favour of the motion. My article goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While Alan Ramsey falsely asserts that nobody from the Opposition spoke in favour of the Lees' motion, the fact is that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I am continuing to read from my letter to the editor&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">all supported the thrust of it but wanted one word changed to make it clearly non-controversial, and I added: "I commend Cathy Freeman for carrying the Aboriginal flag with the Australian flag . . . as a great young Australian woman athlete who has done her community, her nation and herself so proud at these Commonwealth Games", with other Coalition speakers expressing similar sentiments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition not only clearly indicated its support for the thrust of the Motion, it never at any stage expressed any intention of voting against the Motion if its amendment failed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the Motion passed unanimously; no voices said "no", otherwise the Chair would have asked whether a Division was required&mdash;and the record shows no such request.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Mr Ramsey did not know these facts when he wrote his malevolent article, he should have; I issued the attached Media Release yesterday afternoon&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I might add there that it went to his box; I am assured of that by my staff&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Its a shame that Mr Ramsey has now decided to join the over-long list of people seeking to use Cathy Freeman for their own fairly sordid purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>I put Senator Meg Lees, whose behaviour in this matter is intolerable, at the head of that list. I stress: the coalition at no time voted against any recognition of Cathy Freeman. We sought to amend the motion to make it better and, when we failed to do so, from the text of what we said we clearly evidenced support for Cathy Freeman. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, during this time for matters of public interest, I want to make the second of a series of speeches that I am planning to make on the implications for Australia of the information superhighway. This is the result of things that I found during my study tour to the United States a few weeks ago where I went to a range of communication companies, high-tech areas and government authorities to see how this coming information age was going to affect Australia. Today I want to focus in particular on the implications for regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the key questions in this whole new development is: is it going to leave countries with an information-rich group and an information-poor group? One of the great problems with the structure of Australia, where we have basically seven cities containing 80 per cent of the population, is that this new information superhighway will be rolled out across the high density areas, the big cities, and will possibly leave behind rural and regional Australia. We will, if that is the case, end up with information-rich and information-poor groups in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States is grappling with this issue in a very extensive and high-level public debate. It is a debate that is largely absent in this country, with the exception of academic institutions and government departments and some committees of this parliament. Out in the community there is not much debate at this point. It is interesting that in the United States the debate is largely being driven by Al Gore, the Vice-President, who is on talkback shows. He has had a whole series of communications seminars right around the United States. The message that he is basically giving is that the whole development of the information superhighway should be driven by four guiding principles and these are principles that Australia should also consider very carefully. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first principle is to nurture new technologies with a set industry common standard. Senators might recall that when the video machine came into this country we had beta machines and we had VHS machines. Two different standards were set, creating great problems for industry. The great hope is that across all industry there will be one standard that will allow interconnection between this new technology in a simple and easy way. The second principle is to deregulate the marketplace and allow the convergence of what are now seen as separate industries&mdash;in particular, cable, telephone and computer&mdash;and allow an increased level of competition between those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third principle is to balance privacy and law enforcement to keep data safe from criminals and government interference with personal liberties. There is a great debate in America about what is called the `clipper chip'. This is an algorithm that can be used in computer databases to actually protect information from prying eyes. The question for law enforcement authorities is whether they should be given keys to this and allowed access in particular cases where they think criminal activity is occurring on the information superhighway. That debate has a long way to run in America before they come to any sort of conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth principle is to ensure universal access to the information superhighway so that there is no information underclass. The community service obligation of the government to allow access to this new type of industry and the type of services available is an area that is of large concern and has implications for Australia. It is the one I want to focus on today. The danger we face with the way that Telecom and Optus are currently laying out the information superhighway is that they will race for the major cities first to get the largest market share, and therefore the largest profit. The focus of this information superhighway will be a Melbourne-Sydney-Brisbane triangle which will leave out huge areas of the country, in particular, rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new technology provides a tremendous opportunity for the development of new industries. It could be a real sunrise for people in rural and regional Australia if they were properly connected, creating new jobs with the new industries that are going to be coming to our country as a result of the new information age; but it will be a false dawn if towns and rural areas are not connected quickly enough. We could end up with the information rich and poor, particularly in the next 10 years when the current race for the big cities is on. Those are the areas which are likely to be connected up first under the government's current policy. It is really up to this parliament at this time to do something about the way in which we restructure the regulatory framework for this new and developing industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opportunity that lies out there for rural and regional Australia with the information age is to overcome what has been the big thing holding it back all through the last two centuries; that is, in the development of normal products and services, all these areas tend to suffer from what Geoffrey Blayney called the tyranny of distance. The beauty of the information superhighway is that it conquers this, it collapses time and space. It does not matter whether you are out 10, 100 or 1,000 kilometres; you can participate in this new information revolution provided you are connected to it, and that is the big problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for rural and regional Australia to be connected because the boom in new industries and services will drive economic growth right into the early parts of the next century. We can take some guidance for what is happening in this area from the United States. Business and consumer spending on high technology equipment accounts for 38 per cent of economic growth since 1990. Industries that depend on moving and processing information are prospering. Entertainment, financial services and educational services are booming, and the thing that is driving these is the optic fibre network that is paving the way for the information superhighway and replacing the much inferior copper wire system that the world started with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the onset of this new information age we have a situation similar to the start of the industrial revolution. The invention of the optic fibre network is as significant to the information revolution as Watt's steam engine was to the industrial revolution. What it will do for all areas that are connected up is allow the convergence of telephone, computer and cable companies to be able to build an interactive information infrastructure using phone lines, high speed data networks and cable systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect of this will be to link everyone who is on the information superhighway with vast amounts of information, and services and entertainment. There are enormous opportunities here. Just imagine some of the things that could be happening in rural and regional Australia, if it is properly connected. Manufacturers on the north coast could be negotiating with overseas companies for export orders through the electronic mail system. This would give them immediate access to markets right around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Cobar, a rural school could be linked to interactive foreign language classes coming through Sydney. A doctor could be linked to a patient in Narrabri and use the communication network to have interactive consultation with a specialist who is hundreds of kilometres away. This is not fantasy land, this is happening in the United States at the moment. The last example I gave the Senate relates to what is happening in North Carolina. The government there is laying out an information superhighway to link all public institutions in the state. It plans to have all universities, libraries, schools, hospitals and government departments linked into this before the turn of the century and a good start has already been made on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that could come out of that is the opening up of access to education for a wide range of people. Just imagine a situation, say, at Moree High whereby the senior students were able to link, through the information superhighway, into Sydney. Beyond all of those uses that I have mentioned for this new technology is the use&mdash;which is uppermost in people's minds at the moment because the pay TV debate has put it there&mdash;through pay television, for entertainment, video on demand and, in the future, interactive television. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out to the Senate and to the people of Australia that this new information age offers far more than these peripheral entertainment services. It can fundamentally drive and change the whole nature of industry in our country; it can have enormous opportunities for economic growth, for jobs and for the future prosperity of our nation. As a nation, we are well placed to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The United States is leading this information revolution at this stage, but it has a whole series of regulatory problems because of the different acts for its communication areas. Also, each of the 50 state governments has a say in how it is developed, as well as the federal government. We do not have that problem. We have one federal level for the operation of communications in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this parliament and this government can get it right there are great opportunities, not only for the development of industry in Australia for Australians but also for the export opportunities. There is the chance for Australia to become an information hub for all of South-East Asia. To be a major switching point between the American databases and the rest of Asia would be quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the big systems working off the information superhighway is Internet. This involves the linking of 30,000 different database systems around the world, particularly in the United States. As a nation, we are the fourth biggest user of Internet in the world, mainly through our public institutions&mdash;libraries and universities. This can extend much further to business. We can be at the leading edge, ahead of Asia at this point, and be a focal point for future developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the start, in the development of this whole process, we must make sure that the focus is not just on the capital cities. We must ensure that there is investment right across the whole of Australia and that rural and regional Australia is not bypassed. This parliament has to work out some strategies to make sure that that occurs. Optus is a private company, and although Telecom is a corporation we are pretty sure&mdash;despite the government's denials&mdash;that Telecom will be privatised following the coming federal conference of the Labor Party. So how do we ensure that those organisations link up to rural and regional Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite members of the Senate to think about this. What do you do? Do you say that for every five or six urban connections there should be one rural connection? Is that the way you do it? Do you create a pool of funds that the big companies pay into, and then have them and other companies bid to connect up sections of rural and regional Australia? How do you work out who gets the priority? Which areas of the country do you link up first? Do you link up Dubbo first, or Longreach, or Wangaratta? Where do you go first? How do you decide the order of priority?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the much maligned government REDOs, the regional economic development organisations, could be a focus for this sort of development, and we could have these areas linked up on some sort of order of economic priority. These are some of the issues that we need to think about for rural and regional Australia, to make sure that they are not just watchers on the side of the information superhighway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I want to talk to the Senate today about the International Science Olympiads; but before I do so I want to refer you to a portion of an article which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper yesterday which is quite pertinent to the issue that I wish to raise. It was written by Julian Cribb and is headed `Neglect erodes scientific progress'. It says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">John Stocker was mugged by an Australia that doesn't care to face up to the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they gave gold medals for national commitment to science, this country wouldn't even make the semi-finals. It lies 18th in the OECD, and quite a few Asian nations are also zipping past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1992 this newspaper chose Dr Stocker as its Australian of the Year because of his passionate commitment to building a partnership between industry and science as a foundation for future prosperity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Behind the disillusion that led to yesterday's decision not to seek reappointment, there is little doubt that erosion of the national science effort, constant political interference and the inflexibility of the CSIRO structure all played their part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO is not alone. University research, medical research and defence science have suffered long-term loss of support, projects and research capability at a time when most of the developed world&mdash;and Asia&mdash;is redoubling its investment.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe those words of Julian Cribb speak for themselves and need no further comment from me. But, as I said, the International Science Olympiads are what I particularly wish to draw to the attention of the Senate and of the ministers concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">International physics olympiads, international chemistry olympiads and international biology olympiads are held worldwide each year. A growing number of nations participate&mdash;about 50&mdash;with four to five people from each country taking part. But, lest it be thought that only four to five students are actually involved, I add that there are hundreds of students who compete within the country before the olympiad team is chosen. They undertake theoretical examinations and they undertake laboratory examinations and, in the end gold, silver and bronze medals are awarded. These olympiads take place amongst students principally in year 12, but some are in year 11. Australia has been participating in the physics and chemistry olympiads for some seven years, and in biology for a shorter time; but it looks as though Australia will not be participating any further because the Commonwealth government funding for this purpose, amounting to some $350,000 per year, has been cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that this week we should have been congratulating our sports men and women on their fantastic success at the Commonwealth Games. I certainly join in that. I think there is very good reason to spend money on sport. I shall not develop that theme today, but I support what we do in sport. But millions of dollars are spent for the gold, silver and bronze medals which were brought home from Canada, while only $350,000 is needed in this area. The Department of Employment, Education and Training does not seem able to give an adequate explanation as to why these olympiads will not be part of our scheme. The departments of schools, vocational education and training need also, I think, to review what they are doing with their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that this country must strengthen its skills base. There can be no doubt about that. I quoted from the article where `18th in the OECD' was mentioned. The OECD, in its surveys, says that there is a direct correlation between economic prosperity and the percentage of engineers in the work force. In Australia, about one in every 50 people employed is an engineer&mdash;the lowest level of the OECD countries. In Japan, one out of every 15 employees is in the area of science or engineering, and its aim is to have one in 10 in those disciplines by the year 2000. What are we doing about it? We are cutting out the opportunity for our young students who have aptitude in the area of science and engineering to participate in the very area and in the very things that will do them some good and bring credit to this nation. We have done well in the years in which we have been participating. I think the present medal tally stands at chemistry, 23, biology, seven and physics, 12&mdash;and we are depriving our students of the opportunity to participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our universities are out there trying to encourage foreign students to come to our country, trying to advertise ourselves as the clever country, as a country of excellence in education. One of the ways that we really can advertise that we are successful is to have students who are successful, students who are competing well on a worldwide basis. What better way to say that Australia is succeeding in the area of education? I hope that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry), who is present this afternoon, will bring this matter to the attention of his colleagues, show them what I have said and ask why it is that this money has been cut out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money has been provided over the last seven years from a little fund of money which relates to projects of national significance. I invite the minister to table in the Senate details for the last seven years of the allocation of funds under projects of national significance; the projects which have been funded as projects of national significance and how much has been allocated to each of them; and, of course, who has received money under projects of national significance this year, from which the International Science Olympiads have been deleted. It is a disgrace to this country that we should be pursuing this path. I invite the government to reconsider what I believe is a very bad decision indeed and to reverse it in time for us to participate in these olympiads and not have to miss out this year. There is not much time left for this to be done; it really is just a matter of weeks. But there is time for us still to participate if we really are serious about being a participant in the Asian region and in the world. Do not let our focus be only on gold medals obtained in sport. Let us be serious about moving forward and winning medals and succeeding in intellectual activities as well. </PARA>

I refer to the government's decision to pay $150,000 salary for two days a week over a six-month period to the former Labor Party Premier and member of the New South Wales Right mates group, Neville Wran. Is it not a fact that CSIRO's chief executive and premier scientist, Dr John Stocker, who has just announced that he will not continue, receives the same salary as Mr Wran but for a full-time job and obviously greater responsibility to his board, the government, the parliament and the people of Australia?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister receives less than, I think, $150,000; I certainly do, as do other cabinet ministers. We are all in a position in public sector service of making financial sacrifices as compared with what is available, as we all well know, in the private sector for commercially related work. What Mr Wran is doing, of course, is quintessentially commercially related work: he is taking over the chairmanship of an interim board put in place in order to review the situation in relation to ANL, work out its commercial viability and work out a proper operational strategy following from that. He is being appointed not in any form of public capacity but, obviously, in his capacity as a partner in a leading merchant banking and investment advice operation.

As usual, the minister seems to fail to see the point, the point being that Australia will lose its premier scientist that heads up its premier science body&mdash;world renowned, international reputation, critically important to the future of Australia&mdash;and his salary is simply that which the government is prepared to pay to a mate who was not even qualified for the job that he has been put in to do, that is, a job to solve factional differences over ANL and the national conference.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The national accounts were published at 11.30 this morning. They show that the economy is travelling very well. It does augur well for all Australians that we are in for a period of sustained economic growth in this country. The budget predictions are all on track and the manufacturing sector of the economy has been performing in an outstanding manner. All those things are clear from the national accounts. I guess the public of Australia is now waiting to see whether the directions statement of the opposition, to come out next week, will have any detail as to its economic prescriptions or whether it will be simply an empty, vacuous document like many of the policy utterings of its leader, whoever he might be today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's June quarter national account figures confirm the strength of the Australian economy. They show a growth of GDP of 4.3 per cent in the year to June 1994. This figure has been greeted with approving noises from the market and the stock exchange. Market economists have welcomed the figures, noting that the economy is growing strongly but without significant inflationary pressure. Dr Chris Caton, the economist for Bankers Trust, said, `We have got the best of all possible worlds: growth and low inflation.' Today's results show growth in the June quarter of 0.9 per cent, following strong growth in December and March quarters. This shows solid sustainable growth, slightly above the budget forecast. The implicit price deflators are again subdued, reflecting the continued absence of general price pressures in the economy. The GDP deflator was flat for the quarter, resulting in growth in the year to June of 0.9 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as painting an extremely good picture overall, these national accounts show very positive pick-up in investment in plant and equipment. Abstracting from one-off factors, new private plant and equipment investment increased by 13.4 per cent in the June quarter. Over the year to June, new plant and equipment investment increased by 14.8 per cent. This is a welcome reinforcement of other indications of growing business investment, which are seen in the trade figures and the capital expenditure statistics.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard from the opposition calls for a mini-budget and allegations that the economy is overheating. These figures today put a lie to both those propositions. These figures show that we are on track in terms of our budget forecasts and that we have the support of the market and the economists working in the market. There is no need for a mini-budget. There is no need for the fear and trembling that the opposition is trying to engender in the Australian economy because this is a solid sustainable recovery.</PARA>

We can now look forward to a more balanced recovery with business investment playing a greater role in both short- and long-term economic growth.

The minister would be aware of the announcement yesterday by the Deputy Leader of the National Party of a purported new policy to address the worsening drought situation.

Can the minister inform the Senate whether the government intends to act on Mr Anderson's suggestion?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So far as the central plank of the new policy is concerned, we certainly will not. I responded to a question here last week from Senator Boswell, and I made the point that the continuing drought, and the worsening drought, is not now just a problem for people in rural Australia&mdash;who of course are suffering it the worst&mdash;but a problem for the whole of Australia. I therefore awaited, I can tell honourable senators, with a great deal of interest the release of this policy yesterday because, if there had been elements of it that were reasonable, I would have had no difficulty in embracing them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is, as I am afraid some major farming groups have already said, that what was offered instead was not a policy for dealing with the drought but in fact a cruel and uncosted hoax on rural Australia. It was a policy crafted in opposition for opposition. Given that Mr Anderson, extraordinarily, told the press yesterday that the opposition had not costed this policy, which passed through the shadow cabinet yesterday and has become coalition policy, I have asked the Minister for Finance, seeing that the opposition is urging us to adopt it, to cost this policy. A lot of heroic assumptions will have to be made because of the lack of detail that Mr Anderson provided, but one thing he did say was that the central plank of the new policy was a pledge to go back to the old days of the government&mdash;nationally, presumably; the federal government&mdash;providing fodder subsidies; not transport subsidies on fodder, but actually subsidising the fodder itself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These subsidies were well and truly rorted, as Mr Anderson himself acknowledged yesterday; and when he was asked how he would prevent this he said, `Oh, the opposition wouldn't allow that to happen.' He did not actually indicate how. But the difficulty with fodder subsidies&mdash;and one does not have to be an economic genius to work it out; this is what happened last time&mdash;is that they totally distort the marketplace. They send the price of fodder through the roof by at least the amount of the government subsidy, so the farmer actually getting the fodder subsidy ends up exactly where he was before, at square one, because the subsidy he was getting last time in fact was not even covering the inflated cost of the fodder.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only people who were beneficiaries, as the National Farmers Federation said yesterday, were the suppliers of the fodder, not the poor old primary producer who needed the fodder. The other huge hole in this proposal is that the subsidies go only to farmers who are `severely drought affected.' The price of the fodder, of course, goes up for everybody. Mr Anderson also did not define what severe drought is. I am still waiting to hear that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty with this proposition is that the thousands of farmers across Australia who routinely need and use fodder for their normal farming operations will have to pay the inflated cost of the fodder but will not be receiving any government subsidy for doing so. It is an extraordinary proposition, this central plank of the coalition's policies. But this is, I have to say, a unique document, Mr President. It is the only detailed coalition policy that I have ever seen. It is the only one.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It went through shadow cabinet yesterday, it got ticked by the shadow finance minister, it got ticked by the shadow treasurer, and Mr Anderson said yesterday, in terms of how much it will cost, `We will leave the costing of it until later.' It is a fascinating view of the coalition in government. A portfolio minister walks into the cabinet room with a policy proposal that will cost hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;and it will&mdash;with no costings on it and gets it ticked by the shadow treasurer, the shadow finance minister and, presumably, the shadow prime minister, who all said, `That's okay. That's coalition policy now. Tell us about the price later.' That is an interesting window into how those opposite operate.</PARA>

In light of the significant worsening in the balance of payments over the past year, the further worsening that is forecast as imports boom and continue to outstrip export growth, and the rises in interest rates that have already occurred and will continue to occur, what is the government doing or proposing to do to prevent a repeat of its boom-bust policies that have caused such great harm to all Australians over the past decade?</PARA></TALK.START>

The national account figures that I referred to earlier today are the silk purse. They are, as the market economists have said, indicative of a period of sustained growth with low inflation in Australia. That is what the market economists have been saying. I agree with them, and so does the government and any reasonable commentator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at some of the elements of Senator Short's question, one realises that it is not surprising that he wants to try to denigrate the significance of the national accounts which came out today.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the references that Senator Short has just made is to the level of imports. It is true that in the recent figures the level of imports has been up. That is a fact, and that does reflect on the balance of payments. But when we look at the nature of the imports, we see that a large part of those imports is in new plant and equipment. That new plant and equipment represents investment in refurbishing the industrial capacity of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from the opposition at the time of the budget that the investment figures would not be realised. We see now in the latest statistics coming through every likelihood that those investment figures will be over-achieved. One of the indications of that is the level of imports of capital goods into Australia. That is not a sign for commiseration. That is a sign that the economy is on the move; that it is growing; that it is refurbishing its productive capacity; and that it is positioning itself to capture the opportunities for export, particularly in this part of our market in Asia and the Pacific.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short also made reference to exports. Of course the accounts show a slight negative on that.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will try to answer these one, two, three and four. Firstly, the Medicare benefits are generally not claimable where the health services are funded in some other way. Section 19(2) of the Health Insurance Act 1973 specifically precludes the payment of a Medicare benefit for a professional service provided under any arrangement with the Commonwealth, state or territory, local governing body or an authority established by a law of the Commonwealth. So, in general, Medicare benefits are not paid if there is another source of funding to cover the health costs to that institutional service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the period when the Aboriginal health services were funded directly by the government through the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, it was clear that such services were not eligible for payment of Medicare benefits. However, following the establishment of ATSIC, the situation has been less clear and it is known that some services are employing bulk-billing arrangements. This issue is to be considered by the joint planning committee that has been set up by ATSIC, the Department of Human Services and Health and the national Aboriginal community controlled health organisation, which is examining funding arrangements for Aboriginal health. That is an outcome from the budget initiatives for Aboriginal health.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second question was whether there have been any ministerial determinations permitting payments of benefits to these services. An exemption to the prohibition can be given. There are some orders which predate Medicare which allow one or two services to be billed. There is currently a section 19(2) direction under the Health Insurance Act 1973.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the third question as to whether ATSIC is reducing the funding of some services by the amount of money earned from bulk-billing, there is no conclusive information which can be provided to me at this time. Essentially, that is a question that needs to go to ATSIC, and we are in the process of trying to contact ATSIC&mdash;through the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Robert Tickner&mdash;to see if we can provide further information on that matter.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer to the last question&mdash;whether the minister considers that ATSIC funding should be the only source of funding&mdash;is no. Aboriginal health services receive funding from a variety of sources. Certainly, many attract funding from state or territory governments. Services are eligible for funding from a number of specific programs administered by the human services and health portfolio. The fact that they would get money under ATSIC does not preclude them under women's health programs et cetera. That is just one example. There is no restriction which allows the receiving of only one source of funding.</PARA>

Did Senator Collins mislead the Senate in this way? Why did he falsely suggest that Mr Anderson wanted the government to pay this money when he did not? Why did Senator Collins say that the previous government's fodder subsidies saw fodder prices double when, in fact, the ABARE fodder price index rose by only 16 per cent between 1982 and the abolition of the scheme by the Hawke government?

There was a huge argument there, trying to define what `severe drought' was. It is a very important issue, but he has not defined it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Christopher Evans this day, relating to drought.</PARA>
<PARA>We have a drought at the moment that is most horrific. I do not think that it was really that great for the minister to answer the question in the way he did. All he did was criticise Mr Anderson for what he was suggesting would be a great help to those farmers who are suffering such great hardship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does this minister not understand that Australia has a drought that is killing breeding herds and breeding flocks, and laying waste to our vast wheat lands and our agriculture? Does he not understand that the rural adjustment scheme is not working quite as well as it could be? Does this minister not understand that it is his government's policies over the last 10 years that have meant that no farmers have got enough meat on their bones to be able to get through this drought on their own? Does this minister not understand that, basically, we require to keep that breeding flock intact if we are going to come out of this drought in any shape or form?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell alluded to the fact that Mr Anderson did say, `A third of drought incurred debt'&mdash;not all the debt on which the minister is using the figures&mdash;`in some areas would need to be reduced.' If it has been misreported, it obviously was not heard as well as the tape that was held by his office. He also said that the shadow cabinet subcommittee will be examining the extent and depth of that debt and looking at ways of alleviating it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figure of $17-odd billion debt is horrific. He was talking specifically about those very badly drought-affected areas, which I know the minister has sympathised with. But the minister has actually said, `We have given them $14 million odd.' What Mr Anderson is saying is, `We want to keep that breeding herd and the breeding flock going in Australia so that when the drought breaks we are going to be able to supply those export markets'&mdash;about which Senator McMullan will be very cheesed off if we cannot supply, particularly in beef and mutton&mdash;`when the drought breaks.' That is what he is trying to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1982 policy said that the scheme paid farmers 50 per cent of the cost of feed wheat, less the cost of freight, which was subsidised under the natural disaster relief arrangements with subsidies for all other fodder based on the nutritional value relative to wheat. As the minister well knows, because he has told us he has been on the land, total digestible matter is the way we work out the feed values for what we are going to feed our animals. We do not just feed them anything. We work out what is the best value feed that we can use at that particular time. We work it out relative to the price of wheat. Mr Anderson is saying, `We will give you a subsidy to make sure that you can keep that breeding herd and the breeding flock there.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Collins has got the intent of what Mr Anderson said a little bit wrong. He is saying, `We want to keep the breeding herd and the breeding flock there.' Senator Collins should remember&mdash;and I repeat again&mdash;how the government has slammed the farming community in the last 10 years. It has really kicked them in the guts. It has taken away the IEDs so that they are no good any more. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Maybe the fodder scheme is not perfect. It can be finetuned. I am not going to argue that particular point. But I say to Senator Collins that genetics were kept inside this country as a result of what was done from 1982 to approximately 1984. When we have to start shipping grain across the country, from Western Australia to New South Wales and Queensland, to feed stock&mdash;that is what is happening now&mdash;it is time to step in, move on the issue and look at ways in which assistance can be given to get fodder across the country. It does not matter whether this is done by way of subsidising the cost of freight. But we need to act now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins asked: how do we define `severe drought'? The drought policy committee on which I sat had enormous problems with this question. But I can tell Senator Collins that one does know when a severe drought has arrived. We do know that in Queensland and New South Wales in particular there is now an extremely severe drought. There comes a time when people such as senators who sit in this place and the farm leaders of this country have to make a subjective judgment about what the situation is. The government can put all sorts of fancy measures in place in terms of this, but it has to make a judgment. It would not be very difficult right now to make an assessment that we have a severe drought on our hands and that additional support is required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) that I am very disappointed. I believe that he has tried very hard to come to grips with this problem&mdash;I firmly believe that. But I am very disappointed that he should come in here and behave like he did today. That is a reflection against those very good people out there who are battling their hearts out to stay on top of not only their financial bankruptcy and debt problems but also their emotional problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was greatly disappointed by the performance of the minister. I was disappointed by the way he grabbed that press release. I know it will disappoint rural people. We have to look at positive, constructive ways in which we can address this problem. One way is to look very precisely at giving some assistance to help people in the eastern states get fodder from Western Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Brownhill's impassioned speech today represents the frustration that he is feeling for the people in the bush. Yesterday, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) told me in answer to a question I asked him that in the last 12 months the government had spent $154 million on drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Collins" NAMEID="OF4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I didn't. That is the amount of money that is being spent on the rural adjustment scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rural adjustment scheme had been drawn down to $154 million. I point out that in the 1980s the response from the Fraser government was $356 million, which would be more than double that amount&mdash;$700 million&mdash;in today's terms. That is to be compared with the $150 million, give or take a few more dollars, that the government has spent on RAS. For the minister to find an extra $14 million is just recirculating the money that has been allocated to RAS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us just look at what the allocations have been. In 1992-93 the government put into RAS $168.9 million. In 1993-94 the government's contribution has gone down to $24 million. Yes, it has drawn down on state funds that have already been allocated but have never got out to the farmers because the criteria are too high. They are the allocations. So $24.7 million was allocated by the Commonwealth government to RAS in 1993-94. Sure, money has been drawn down from the states to build it up. But that money has all been re-allocated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the wool `exceptional circumstances' that the government offered. Yes, the government said $42 million, but it made the criteria so high that only $15 million was spent. There is an underspend there of $27 million. Then, with drought `exceptional circumstances' and the worst drought in Australia, there was the allocation of $17 million, of which $10.5 million was spent&mdash;a $6.6 million underspend in the worst drought in Australia. Then, of the total RAS of $187 million in 1993-94, only $113 million was spent&mdash;an underspend of $74 million. No wonder Senator Brownhill, Senator Panizza and Senator Crane are getting frustrated. We know what is going on out there. We know this is a pea and thimble trick. The government is allocating money, not spending it, reallocating it, going out into the bush, getting another $14 million out of the money that it has not spent and regenerating it again&mdash;and the farmers out there are in terrible strife. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All right, let us put that to one side. But it is unforgivable for those opposite to then come in and misrepresent what John Anderson has tried to do. Today, instead of getting in there and supporting him, they bucketed and misrepresented him&mdash;and that is unforgivable. As I have suggested to Senator Collins&mdash;and I think he is man enough to do it&mdash;if he is wrong, he should have the decency to get up in the Senate tomorrow and apologise. People out there in the bush will admire him for doing so. But if he just goes out and buckets someone who is trying to do his best for the farmers, they will treat him with disdain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Collins listens, he might learn something. These days, with lot feeding and non-lot feeding, a lot more wheat is being used than in 1982-83. That is because farmers have to be a lot more careful feeding stock on wheat than on oats, barley, hay or whatever. Using wheat in small measured quantities means that the management has to be a lot stricter. There is a lot more detail to it. It must be remembered that using wheat means being able to control the price paid for fodder.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oats has taken off. We got only $80 a tonne for oats delivered in Fremantle this year. Fortunately, we left it in the grain shed instead.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take a somewhat different tack on the same matter, and link it to the question asked of Senator Gareth Evans by Senator Margetts. The drought we are experiencing now is related to the so-called El Nino effect. We have had four years of El Nino. My understanding is that, while the El Nino phenomenon was recognised in the early 1980s, the records show that on two previous occasions its effects have lasted for three years. One occasion was from 1911 to 1914 and the other was from 1939 to 1942.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in fact, this is not entirely without precedent, although the four-year El Nino, as far as we can discover from the records, is without precedent. The point I make here is that, while no scientist at the moment is prepared to argue that the increase in sea surface temperatures is the cause of El Nino and therefore the cause of the drought, nonetheless it is consistent with the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard in answer to a question today that the government still has a commitment to greenhouse targets; however, it is not going to do things that will interfere with the Australian economy. If, indeed, this present four-year El Nino is related to the greenhouse effect&mdash;it may be; we do not yet know&mdash;as Senator Collins has pointed out, the cost to the Australian economy runs into many billions of dollars. In considering our response to our profligate use of greenhouse gas&mdash;and picking up the point that Senator Crane was making, that we should be addressing the problem&mdash;part of the problem may well be the excessive use of fossil fuel by the world in general and Australia in particular, and we can do something about that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McGauran should wait until I have finished before he makes a fool of himself again. He demonstrated his ignorance on transport subsidies a minute ago. I have been advised that the government of Queensland is preparing a further examination of its own situation for presentation to the Commonwealth government. I also know that the government of New South Wales is doing the same thing. I point to the record in terms of Senator McGauran's interjection&mdash;that the immediate call by the Premier of New South Wales, after he toured the drought affected areas of New South Wales, has already been answered by this government. In fact, it was answered within 24 hours in terms of providing additional finance for exceptional circumstances, which was what Mr Fahey asked for, and for it to be extended to New South Wales&mdash;and we have done that. I think our record speaks for itself on this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated, and so has the Prime Minister, that we are prepared to do this. It is easy when one is in opposition to do all of these things off the top of one's head&mdash;to pump out press releases which do not have to be costed and which do not need the support of the Department of Finance or the Treasury. One also has to work with the appropriate state governments. The most astonishing thing about the policy on drought which the coalition released yesterday&mdash;and this has been reported; if it is wrong, Mr Anderson will have to correct it but seeing that the people who have said it are from the farm organisations concerned, I do not see how it can be wrong, unless they have been misreported, too&mdash;is that it has not discussed this vitally important response to the drought with any of the peak industry bodies in primary industry. It certainly has not discussed it with the state governments&mdash;in the case of New South Wales, that is its colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say as a matter of record that everything the government has done to this point, and will continue to do, has been done in close consultation with the relevant peak industry groups and the state governments, irrespective of what political party they might belong to. They would acknowledge that there has been no degree of partisan politics introduced in any of the discussions that I have had with my state colleagues on this matter, and which I will continue to have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have indicated on the public record, and so has the Prime Minister, that we will work together cooperatively with the state governments. We are waiting for further responses from those governments, which are properly investigating the matter in their own states, in terms of what additional assistance may be required. That is being done now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I apologise to Senator Brownhill for calling him an idiot because he is a senator for whom I have some regard. What I get a little distressed about&mdash;and Senator Brownhill must understand this&mdash;is that I know there is an enormous amount of misunderstanding in rural Australia about the schemes of assistance that can be accessed by farmers. I have spoken to farmers personally, and it has been reported to me far more that there are many people who do not know what is available. We are addressing that. In the last cabinet discussion on this matter&mdash;and I said it publicly&mdash;I got an amount of money that we will use to direct mail farmers around Australia. We have been doing it through the peak organisations and through television and radio but clearly there are still gaps. We will direct mail a complete account of what farmers can apply for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is why&mdash;and unfortunately the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will show it&mdash;I get a little distressed when respected National Party senators say, `The IED scheme has been removed by the government.' Senator Brownhill may criticise how it has been established. He may suggest better ways of doing it. It has not been removed. It currently contains $135 million, comprising 6,500 individual deposits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should look at an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> headlined, `Wipe farm debts, says Coalition to banks'. If that report is wrong, Mr Anderson should take it up with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>.

<PARA>That may well be incorrect, too. I advise Senator Panizza that that is also printed in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>. I do not think it is unreasonable, as I do not have time to attend coalition press conferences&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Troeth this day, relating to Mrs Joan Kirner.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Gareth Evans indicated in his answer that the superannuation board did not accept Mrs Kirner's claim and it was thrown out, and one could therefore judge from that that she was not a suitable subject for compensation. I wonder if Senator Evans realised what he said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kirner is the ex-premier of Victoria and is apparently a figure of very good standing with the Victorian electorate, regardless of the electoral prospects of her party. She must have seriously misrepresented her health claims. The sum of $360,000 would indicate massive health problems. Mrs Kirner mentioned her problems in an interview in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Age</EMPHASIS> of 24 April last in which she said she suffered from tendonitis and migraine. I am sure that we all sympathise with Mrs Kirner on her health problems, but it is a pity that in all her public utterances on her retirement we did not hear more about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reasons that Mrs Kirner advanced publicly for her departure and her retirement were: firstly, generational change; secondly, more things to life than parliamentary politics; and thirdly, retirement so that new blood could be injected. At the ALP conference on 26 March last she said, `I am doing it because I now believe there are women to come behind me'&mdash;a rather ironic comment in view of the subsequent pre-selection of a male for her seat of Williamstown. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, in his reply Senator Evans indicated that, as Mrs Kirner's claim had been rejected by the superannuation fund, perhaps the ex-premier's health problems had not been sufficient to warrant such a massive payout. Mr Deputy President, no wonder the Australian community has such a low opinion of politicians when we have such a glaring example of an attempt to extract money from a state superannuation fund by an ex-premier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This must have been undertaken with the same sense of financial unreality that enabled Mrs Kirner to chalk up $32 billion worth of state debt and let state finances get so out of control that the government was borrowing money just to pay money on past borrowings. This has been a sorry episode in a career allegedly devoted to the public interest. I can only conclude from Senator Evans's remarks that Mrs Kirner grossly misrepresented her medical condition in an attempt to wring more money from the Victorian taxpayer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, is there a crisis facing health care in Australia? Clearly there is. It is largely a funding crisis, and it is largely a crisis of the government's own making. Indeed, for want of a better source of confirmation of that, let us go to the government's former minister Graham Richardson, who said in December 1993, `The case for reform is overwhelming.' I do not usually take his words as gospel, but in this case he is absolutely right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the most recent figures, we will see that only 37.2 per cent of the Australian population currently has private health cover. That compares with roughly 70 per cent at the time of the introduction of Medicare in 1983-84. It is anticipated that in 1997 it will be down to 29 per cent, unless something is done. It means that, under the Labor government, approximately a third of Australians have decided for one reason or another not to provide for their own health  care but to rely on the public system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this is that, if they are not using the private system, they have to use the public system, and the public system is already creaking and groaning at the seams because of the chronic underfunding, largely as a result of federal government cutbacks. The extra costs to New South Wales alone have been estimated at $300 million per year. The situation is in fact so bad that the Medicare agreement signed slightly more than a year ago will now need to be renegotiated because the triggers involved will be reached when the September quarter figures come out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The September quarter figures will show a two per cent fall in Australians with supplementary health insurance over that period of slightly more than a year. So the whole kit and caboodle will need to be renegotiated again with the states. That is how quickly things are deteriorating in Australia. There is a crisis and, sadly, this government has not attempted to address it in any realistic way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of problems is that people have to pay over and over again for health care. Firstly, they have to pay via the Medicare levy. Secondly, they have to pay via their general taxation and other revenues. Thirdly, they may have to pay via their private health insurance premium. Even if they are insured, they have to pay the gap, which this government makes it impossible to cover. The proposals announced by Minister Lawrence today will not fix any of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those costs is relatively dispensable&mdash;the cost of private health insurance; so people drop it. The amazing thing to me is not that the figure is as low as 37.2 per cent; the amazing thing to me is that it is as high as 37.2 per cent, when one looks at all the disincentives to being privately insured&mdash;the extra costs involved and the lack of good benefits, which are a result of government interference and government controls. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are incentives to utilise the public system. What a nonsense it is for a government to say, `Don't provide for your own health care; don't even contribute to it. We'll look after you. We'&mdash;out of taxpayer revenue, of course&mdash;`will do this.' It is absolute madness. Every time there is a one per cent drop in the number of people insured in Australia, it represents, on conservative estimates, another $100 million burden on the purse of the taxpayer. It is paid for out of taxpayers' money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is Minister Carmen's solution? Her perception is that the problem lies with everybody being too greedy: the doctors are too greedy; the hospitals are too greedy; everybody is too greedy. Her solution is to allow the health funds into a privileged, monopolistic position. She will allow them to refuse to pay a private hospital unless they are able to enter into some contract with that hospital. This is a true Damoclean sword hanging over hospitals, forcing them to accept a health fund's offer. Essentially, if the private hospitals do not accept those sorts of offers and contracts, they could be out of business. If I have ever heard of a more blatant contravention of the principles underlying the Trade Practices Act, it must surely be that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me read to the Senate a few quotes about the Trade Practices Act, which will clearly need to be either repealed or severely modified. Michael Duffy, the former Attorney-General, in 1992 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act . . . has become a central pillar in the operation of efficient and competitive markets and is a law of which the Australian Labor Party justifiably may be proud.</PARA>
<PARA>If the government is so proud of that act why is it going to either change or repeal it? Mr Duffy continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It signalled the beginning of the end for the old comfortable but inefficient practices such as resale price maintenance and market sharing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA>This is just what we are talking about. One law was introduced to abolish market sharing arrangements and here we have the minister for health reintroducing them&mdash;good old socialist dogma. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC is essentially imbued with the responsibility of stopping monopolies and yet Minister Lawrence is creating monopolies. In particular, in Western Australia this has the potential to be a major problem. One health fund in WA has about 80 per cent of the market share. Fortunately, that fund is a very honourable and respectable fund but, potentially, it could misuse that power and destroy a private hospital or a private hospital chain by simply refusing to pay benefits. To give that sort of power to any organisation anywhere in Australia is contrary to everything that all of us in this place must surely stand for and believe in. Worse than that, not only is the government doing something terribly damaging but it is doing something which will not work. We have already seen in Victoria that preferred provider arrangements do not cut costs. The minister is attacking the wrong end of the sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By its own admission the government has repeatedly said&mdash;and I think Minister Crowley has said the same thing&mdash;that health funds are inefficient. We have heard figures quoted of overheads of 12 per cent to 18 per cent compared with three per cent for Medicare. So why is the government then saying that it will take a very efficient and cost effective industry, the private hospital industry, and hand it over to an inefficient industry to control? It does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Add to that the extra problem that many of the major funds run their own hospitals and one has an enormous conflict of interest. Of course there are incentives for the health funds to direct patients towards their own hospitals and to put the other hospitals out of business. It may not be misused but the potential for misuse exists and we should not be giving that power to the health funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then if one adds into this equation the fact that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and the Department of Finance are bitterly opposed to any watering down of the Trade Practices Act, it seems that we have a major conflict within the Australian Labor Party and its departments about the validity of this approach. We are undermining here the basic principles of freedom and competition&mdash;something which this government has crowed about but is clearly determined to undermine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community rating, admirable though it is&mdash;we support the principle of community rating&mdash;does not allow competition. Unless the government allows true competition, it will never get anywhere in lowering the premiums. Some of Minister Lawrence's proposals will actually increase premiums. I understand that she will allow private beds in public hospitals to be remunerated at a rate equivalent to private hospital beds. Somebody has to pay for that. The difference is, roughly, between $180 and $400. That will have to be paid for by premiums which will have to rise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Lawrence will force closed funds to become open funds. So the 300,000 people covered by those cheaper, subsidised and industry-based closed funds who will no longer be in that category may well be tempted to drop their private health insurance&mdash;another 300,000 people who will not be covered. That will not help the situation at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a more sinister element to Minister Lawrence's proposals however, and this relates to the reinsurance proposals, which I understand may be part of this package, although I have not had confirmation of that. Essentially, it means that participation in the reinsurance scheme will be dependent upon the profile of the fund. Removing the gobbledygook, essentially that means that funds will be rewarded for having lots of young participants. It is all well and good to encourage young people to join the funds but there is another way of changing the profile and that is to get rid of the elderly and sick who really need the cover. I have seen nothing yet which will stop funds from doing that&mdash;a terrible indictment of the proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another proposal that will intrude is the overseeing of the servicing of patients by the health funds. Year in and year out we have had complaints from Senator Crowley and her colleagues about the American system. One of their complaints has been about the extra level of bureaucracy, the requirement for second opinions and the requirement for overseeing by bureaucrats. Exactly what happens in the United States will now be introduced here. The health funds will be able to say to a doctor, `Why did you do such and such a test? Why did you do such and such a procedure?' This is interference in the clinical management of patients at a level we have never seen before. This little gem is tucked away in the legislation, which in itself is enough to invalidate the whole procedure. If we do not do something about this we as a parliament really should be ashamed of ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say that there are some good things in this. I have no problem at all with allowing patients to know the costs they are up for when they go to see a doctor. I do have problems if that means advertising that Dr Bloggs can do a heart transplant for $5,000 whereas Dr Chang, for example, costs $10,000. That is a very pertinent example because Victor Chang, who sadly is no longer with us, was one of the leading heart surgeons in the world and his fees were appropriately higher. This means that, sadly, there may be an emphasis upon price at the expense of quality. So a lot of safeguards will need to be introduced to make sure that there is not simply a shopping around for the cheapest price, and it is part of an education process, about which I hope the minister would share my concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very sad today, listening to the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. She was prattling on as she always does and the interviewer could not get a word in, as is always the case. She was talking about the importance of cost saving, the importance of efficiency and the importance of deliveries. Nowhere in the whole interview did she talk about quality of care or quality of caring. That is a terrible indictment of any minister, particularly a minister for health and it is a terrible indictment of any government. We must understand that the most important thing we have to face up to here is the quality of care and the end result of caring for those patients. Unless we make that our main priority, we will never have a decent health system of which we can really be proud. </PARA>

A lot of us in this place, and people out there listening, would have to be sick and tired of the opposition's claims that Medicare is sick. On any evidence it is not. If it were sick, why has Senator Woods and his party, at least to this point, endorsed bulk-billing which is the principle underpinning plank of Medicare?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was Senator Newman in here yesterday complaining bitterly about a push to move away from bulk-billing? Good heavens! Let us be consistent! There is nothing sick with Medicare. It is hugely popular in the electorate and it is delivering all that it should. It is delivering an excellent service in public hospitals. The people in this country who do not like their rapidly increasing premiums for private insurance or the fact that with private insurance they get a very big bill&mdash;the only place they can get a big bill&mdash;are leaving private insurance and moving to the excellent public hospital system. That is what the community is saying and doing and that is why Medicare is not, not, not sick. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woods argued in the most peculiar kind of way, covering old, out-of-date and tired points that were never valid and are certainly not valid today. One could ask Senator Woods what his previous health policy got him. It got him into opposition, on the back bench and into the Senate. I would have to say that was pretty good for one health policy. I am glad Senator Woods is smiling because he made a great contribution to the re-election of the Labor government. And why? Because the community loves Medicare. People know it; it is simple and it is clear. In large part, that is what the opposition agrees with and that is why it will not change it dramatically. That is why Senator Woods is standing up here making very curious comments about private health insurance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it puts premiums up. I can tell Senator Woods about it. I chaired a committee and sat opposite the protagonists&mdash;the private health insurance industry and the private hospitals. The representative of the private hospitals said, `Please remove the discrimination. Remove the subsidised private bed contribution for private patients in public hospitals. This will make fair competition. This will ensure that our beds are no more expensive. This will mean that people will return to the private hospitals in droves.' When he turned around, the representative of the private health insurance industry beside him was ashen faced and said, `You can't do that. It'll push premiums up.' Of course it will push premiums up. It will push premiums up if it is done without all the other changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is part of a package of changes and deals with the thing that Senator Woods argued for and said that we are not doing&mdash;introducing more competitive practices, encouraging a fair comparison of the costs of a private bed, without subsidy, in a public hospital. That is what the Private Hospital Association wants and what the private health insurance industry will be able to incorporate in this whole package of changes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> medical writer Steve Dow stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Victorian Minister for Health, Ms Tehan, has said that preferred-provider arrangements will fail to stop the decline in private insurance coverage . . . because it had not done so in Victoria.</PARA>
<PARA>On 25 August the health writer for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS>, Bill Birnbauer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Health Minister, Mrs Tehan, conceded yesterday that reduced waiting lists at public hospitals had contributed to sharp falls in the number of privately-insured Victorians.</PARA>
<PARA>She made no apology for that. So efficient and effective are the public hospitals in Victoria that it has taken away an inducement for people to take out private insurance. The waiting list argument is a spurious argument. It always has been and there is Minister Tehan saying so. She then changed her mind very quickly. I am sure people rang her up and said, `Woops, hold on, that is a line for the opposition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> also states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the chief executive of the Australian Health Insurance Association, Mr Russell Schneider, said yesterday the Victorian deals had never been "genuine" preferred-provider arrangements because fund benefits had risen to meet hospital charges, rather than hospitals lowering their charges to meet the demands of funds.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly why there is a change; the package of goods allows for that to change in a very different way. A number of the regulations that have constrained private health insurance have gone. The consumer focus is there. There is a requirement for single billing, more patent costing of charges and the medical expenses to be made clear to patients before they purchase. All of those things will be ways in which private funds will be assisted to be more competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the most important point that we have to deal with is the continuing false argument about public hospital waiting lists being a cause for major concern. There is a very small amount of concern as Senator Woods, more than most people, would know. He knows that that is a false argument. In his own state of New South Wales he can get those figures, and they are very encouraging. For all emergency procedures, something like about half of the one million or so fronting up at New South Wales public hospitals are dealt with within 24 hours and, of course, it is usually very much less than that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point is that of the majority of people who are coming in for non-emergent&mdash;that is, elective&mdash;surgery Minister Tehan says that the waiting list is largely gone in Victoria. I do not think Senator O'Chee would want to argue with the Minister for Health in Victoria. In New South Wales the figures show that only a small percentage of people  have a longer time to wait. We all know that that longer waiting time is the thing that matters and that that is unacceptable. That is why the government has introduced special arrangements, including increased funding, as incentives to reduce those waiting lists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know that a number of private hospitals had been initially willing to take those public patients into their private beds&mdash;there are some good examples in New South Wales&mdash;and then the doctors refused to do the work on public patients in private beds. It is a disgrace, but that is what we have had to deal with and, indeed, why there has been a continuing unacceptable waiting time for some people in specialist needs for elective surgery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do know is that the opposition is trying, particularly with a whole series of new announcements, whereby the consumers will be the big winners. The contribution of private health insurance is being encouraged by ways in which the cost of premiums will be reduced; where patients will have more access to information, a charter of rights, so that they will know more clearly what the obligations of hospitals and the health service is to them; where they will have single billing; and where the requirement is for medical practitioners to outline to the patients what they can expect to pay before the procedure, so that they do not find a series of bills coming in afterwards that shocks them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woods knows more than most that this notion of crisis in Medicare is absolutely untrue, confirmed again and again by the popular polling on this matter and confused by things like the state hospitals, particularly New South Wales and Victoria, dramatically cutting their funding out of health under the guise of casemix. They have had higher funding than they have ever had and as the Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, says the Commonwealth pours the money in from one end and the states are taking it straight out the other. They have taken 12 per cent out for the Victorian health system and 2 per cent out for the New South Wales system. Minister Phillips then has the gall to come asking for another $10 million. Minister Phillips should spend what he has got and fix it up for the people of New South Wales. He should not anticipate an imminent New South Wales election, particularly after he has been clobbered in the Parramatta by-election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woods made a comment about looking at quality rather than just talking about economics. I believe that Australia has one of the most accessible and equitable health services in the world. I think if we, unfortunately, take out of that the health statistics of our Aboriginal community and just look at the life expectancy of the rest of Australians, infant mortality rates et cetera, we will see that we certainly have a health system that gives us one of the highest levels of care anywhere in the world. If we look then at the economic side of it, we spend some 8.6 per cent of our gross domestic product. While that is slightly above the OECD average, it is nowhere near the high expenditure rates in some other Western countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at the specific question that we have before us today on whether or not we have a crisis in health funding in Australia, I would like to take it one part at a time. Firstly, I will answer some of Senator Wood's comments as to the crisis in private health insurance and to answer those, what I believe to be spurious remarks, I think we just need to look at the statistics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no crisis in private health insurance. When we take the period between 1984-85 and 1992-93 and actually look at the contributions that have gone into the coffers, we see that there has been a 171 per cent increase in the actual income that the funds have received. If we look over that period at the increased amount of money they have spent on management, we see that it has gone up 126 per cent. If we take one final figure, and that is the total reserves, we see that they have increased over that period by 132 per cent. They have gone from total reserves of $520 million in 1984-85 up to $1.205 billion in reserves for the private health insurance industry as a whole. So I would argue that, far from being in crisis, they are doing very nicely thank you. The only problem they have is that many Australians are voting with their feet. They are actually looking at what they get for their dollar and they are deciding that it really is not worth it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we try to find another crisis, the next place we can look is in the private hospital system. Again, we have a great deal of trouble finding any sign of a crisis because they are, in fact, increasing the number of beds that they are providing. Surely no-one is going to go into business providing hospital beds if they think that they are going to make a loss. If we actually look at the number of people that are choosing to use private hospital beds, we see that there has been an increase. It has gone up to about 29 per cent of the total patient admissions, compared with before Medicare when only about 23 per cent of total admissions were into the private hospital system. So there is no sign of a crisis there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we then move on to the public hospital system. I will argue here that, while we do not have a crisis, we certainly have some problems. If we want to look at Medicare as a whole, we see that a big crack is appearing in the public hospital system and we have to stand back and look at why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly one of the problems revolves around the fact that we have the highest hospitalisation rate in the western world, give or take Iceland. It depends how one counts where we are, but we are certainly way up there with the top few countries. We have to ask why. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I move around and visit hospitals, particularly in my home state of South Australia, I come back again to the lack of other services: the lack of mental health services; the lack of aged care services; and the lack of drug and alcohol counselling. There is a lack of allied services such as appropriate accommodation for people awaiting admission to nursing homes. There is lack of services for people suffering from a drug-related illness&mdash;people who, simply because there is nowhere else to go, are sent to a hospital, often by a kind policeman who decides not to lock them up in police cells. Unfortunately, after being detoxed or treated for the night they often go back onto the streets, only to find themselves back in hospital again in a few days time, using up one of the most expensive services in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats suggest that if we put more money into the next level of services, into community services, we would in fact save money. To save money in this country we will initially have to spend some money to provide that level of services, the cheaper option services. The money will not just go into what we might call the traditional health areas; it will also be spread across into housing. We need to have other facilities for people rather than the very expensive option of a public hospital bed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the time available to me, I would like to look at a few of the other problems in the public hospital system. We see the cost shifting that is going on, thanks to the state governments. Victoria has taken out some $370 million at the same time as the federal government has tried to pump in some $270 million. I have to agree here with the minister that several state governments are now cost shifting at such a rate that they are undermining the very system they are supposedly supporting and preserving for their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My home state of South Australia will also be using casemix funding, not as an approved system of administration but simply as a means of freeing up money to be used for purposes other than those within the health system. We note the high administrative costs of having various levels of state and federal administration. We also note the duplication and overlapping of services, and the very poor coordination and integration of services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ask the federal government to consider whether it wants to just sit back and look at the public hospital systems in many states being run down to the point where they will be closed or privatised, as is happening in many rural areas, particularly in Victoria. Does it want public hospital services shifted to aged care areas with the communities losing a range of other services, particularly some of their crisis care services?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure that we can call the situation regarding waiting lists in our public hospitals a crisis. Certainly there is a problem in some parts of Australia. The base problem is that we do not have any sort of state-wide computerised system of adequate lists to tell us where the wait is or what it is for. If we could get those systems in place we could surely start to look at the availability of specialists rather than shift patients from the north of Sydney to the south, or from the east of Adelaide to the west or whatever. Until we have those waiting lists, which will have to be compiled by state governments, we cannot continue to claim that we have a problem of huge waiting lists. A lot of this is anecdotal, and in my home state a lot of the problems could be solved by suggesting that people talk to their doctors and look again at perhaps moving to other hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Casemix funding, which I have touched on very briefly, will give us the opportunity actually to spend some of the dollars in a range of other community services. Instead of that, at least three state governments are using this simply as a cost saving measure. Instead of taking that money out of health, if we could spend it in areas such as rehabilitation, adequate discharge planning and community nursing and, as I said before, for specific programs such as aged people with dementia and for those with alcohol related illnesses, we would see fewer people actually needing our public hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot get away from the issue of the inequitable distribution of services. This is the only area in respect of which I will agree with Senator Bob Woods that we have a crisis. In particular, I wish to highlight the crisis in funding for Aboriginal health. This is an area in which the government's words do not meet its actions. In this year's budget we were told that there was to be an additional $500 million for Aboriginal health. But when one looks at the papers, at the figures and at the sums, one sees that the vast bulk of that money was in fact ongoing funding to maintain the 90-odd community health services at the existing inadequate levels. There is only just over $5 million per year of extra money to be spread around those 90-odd Aboriginal community health services. Bearing in mind that there is already a crisis in that last year many of these health services were not able to get through to even the end of the year before running out of money, one wonders how that very small amount of money spread across so many services will go anywhere near solving those problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another poor area is the area of mental health. Again we see several crises there due to a lack of adequate funding, particularly in rural areas. The government has done very little about the general area of preventive medicine. We can see huge potential problems in this area unless we again tackle the whole question of primary health care services and prevention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the potential problems that I do not have time to cover in this speech include the increasing range of litigation and the cost of litigation. We have to look at the cost of new drugs and new procedures. We need to look at the way in which we will have to come to terms with some form of rationing of services and some way of distributing services equitably as we move towards the year 2000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a matter of public importance proposed by Senator Bob Woods relating to the government's continued failure to understand the extent of the crisis in health funding in Australia and its failure to devise the correct policy response. One of the best ways for us to try to get some decent answers in this place would be for the government, if it really treated this issue seriously, to give us a minister in the Senate who could understand and respond to the serious questions being asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments today of the Minister for Family Services, Senator Crowley, were nothing short of very disturbing. For a minister in this place to stand up and say that Medicare is the solve-all and be-all of everything and that there is nothing wrong with the health system is just appalling. The suggestion that there are no waiting lists and that this matter is of no concern bears no relevance whatsoever to the reality faced by those who are on waiting lists. One day Senator Crowley may well be on a waiting list. Needless to say, as a high income earner and as a Labor member of parliament, she is not privately health insured. I hope for her sake that she does not end up on the back end of a waiting list because that is when she will find out what the reality is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister then tried to say how wonderful the public hospital system is for patients who have heart attacks, because they are taken to a public hospital. Could Senator Crowley tell me where emergency patients are generally taken when they have a heart attack? Of course they are taken to public hospitals and invariably they are then transferred to the private hospital of their choice. They can choose to be transferred. We have been down that track.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The problem is that Senator Crowley does not understand all of the ramifications of what is going on. To say that there is no problem flies straight in the face of what former senator Graham Richardson said when he was health minister and also what the current Minister for Human Services and Health, Dr Lawrence, is saying&mdash;that is, that the whole system needs to be reformed. If they were to take Senator Crowley's advice they would sit on their hands and do nothing. What has happened today is the next best thing to doing nothing. What has happened today has not pinpointed the problems so that they can be resolved. The continuing false argument&mdash;I do not know what Senator Crowley is trying to say&mdash;about waiting lists is very serious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley also added that the measure announced today will put premiums up. Senator Crowley said that with some pride. I would suggest that increased premiums will be a further disincentive for people to join the private health insurance system. There was a 70 per cent coverage rate by private health insurance in the pre-1984 era. However, since the introduction of Medicare that rate has dropped to 37.2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She is talking here about Medicare being so wonderful, and how we can indulge ourselves further by increasing health insurance. It is just remarkable. She mentioned in the Senate, and the minister for health mentioned in her press release, that people are voting with their feet and getting out of private health insurance schemes. That is quite right, to one extent: they have to because they are being booted out. They are feeling the force of a foot, all right. They are feeling the force of a foot right in the backside that is pushing them out on an economic basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government could not give a continental about that. It could not care that it is forcing more and more people out of a system because they can no longer afford to pay it. This government must recognise that it is pushing the system out of the reach of so many ordinary Australians. The number of pensioners who are actually insured in the private health insurance system at their personal expense is extraordinarily high. Why? Because they do not trust Medicare. Why? Because when they might need a hip replacement, they cannot get one. Why? Because when they might need a cataract operation, they cannot get one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, this government has a responsibility to make private health insurance more affordable. But it is not doing that. The issue of gap insurance, for example, has long been a stumbling block for this government. The latest attempt by Dr Lawrence is this preferred provider plan which allows insurers to make deals on fees with doctors in private hospitals, allowing them to set lower insurance premiums for people who agree to be treated by such providers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That might sound good on the surface, but let us have a look at the reality of the whole situation. There will be, as Dr Nelson said, the possibility of monopolies and oligopolies. But does this government care about that? No, it does not care about the oligopolies. It could not care less. The government must know that there is a crisis, and yet the minister for health refuses to speak to the doctors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Nelson, the federal president of the AMA, has phoned the minister for health three days in a row and she refuses to return his phone calls. Until such time as there is some determined attack on this, we will see a further decline of the private health insurance system. In her press release today, the minister said, `In recent times consumers have been voting with their feet.' As I say, they have been doing that quite clearly for very obvious reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She also went on to say that the private health insurance industry is an important and successful part of our health system. Well, bully for her! Why then have government policies been so determined to run that very same system down? Insurers can offer preferred provider packages which will supposedly offer reduced premiums, but they lose their rights. Where can they then start to have a total right of where they want to go, and why should they not have a right? Everybody should have a right. But once again, what we are talking about is further government control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very serious in those states, such as mine, where there is a monopoly&mdash;and I am not saying that the Hospital Benefit Fund is not a superb private health insurer. As a member of it, I know that it is a superb private health insurer. But the fact of the matter, as Senator Woods has already said, is that there is a risk that these private health insurance companies who own hospitals can then manipulate the system. I do not want to see that risk being run, but this government does not seem to care about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is one certain outcome from Dr Lawrence's submission to cabinet this morning, it is more uncertainty and a less clear future for people who need to get into private health insurance. The private health insurers will be given more power than is desirable in the preferred provider plan, and that is something that we need to focus upon. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the second health discussion on a matter of public importance in three days. I agree that health is very important. However, today's debate, I think, can be characterised by the words `understand' and `has not had it confirmed', which stand out most in my mind from the first speaker. That was because he did not understand or did not know what Dr Lawrence had put out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why choose today, of all days, the day when the minister took a submission to cabinet about the issue, the day when we will find out what the government is planning to do, and the day when those opposite will be able to read and understand? But instead those opposite chose to bring it to the parliament today. It was quite apparent that their lead speaker had not been able to read, understand and digest the material that had been provided by the minister. That is a shame because it reduces the standard of the debate. The second speaker, however, did not go down that path, but went down the usual path of a vitriolic personal attack upon the minister in this house, which we are getting used to her doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing those opposite did not do, which differentiates their attack on this issue from the Australian Democrats' attack, is that again they did not tell us what their policies are. We know that they do not have many policies. They support bulk billing; we know that. We know that their shadow health minister has been writing in the Sunday papers about how there should be tax relief and tax rebates for health insurance premiums. But that is about all we do know. We know very little else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that those opposite are going to put out their directions statement, but I guess it was like everything else that has been going through their party room in the last couple of days&mdash;they have to have 3 1/2-hour debates just to discuss one piece of legislation. When they have made up their minds, I guess we will know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to turn to what we do know about their health policies or what we assume are their health policies&mdash;they might just be Mrs Bishop's policies; we do not know&mdash;and that is the big issue of tax rebates. There are several points that are very important to look at when we are talking about tax rebates as an incentive to encourage people to take out private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first one is: who pays the money to give a rebate to people? The answer to that is the government. The government gives the money. But whose money is it? It is the people's money. It is the taxpayers' money. Who does it benefit the most? It benefits those most who pay the most tax. So those of us sitting here on our $70,000-plus a year incomes, thank you very much&mdash;with an extra $1,000 off or whatever it is for the private health insurance these days: I do not know because I do not pay that sort of thing&mdash;will have this rebate which we can claim against our tax. Therefore, we benefit more than those people on low incomes or non-taxable incomes&mdash;pensioners. People on low incomes pay very little or no tax and therefore they do not receive a very great benefit from a tax rebate. If we do not pay tax, getting a tax rebate is of absolutely no value to us. This is the case with the pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criticism that I receive most from people about the health industry is, `I have paid into the highest health fund and now when I have a call upon it, I am getting bills&mdash;and big bills.' I have a neighbour who recently had bilateral cataracts done in a private hospital. She had top health cover. It cost her, over and above the health insurance, $6,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They had been insured for 40 years or more. Her sister, who requires bilateral cataracts also but who has no health insurance, is choosing to go to a private hospital and to pay cash. It will cost her $1,000. That is probably the amount of money that a family would pay in a year for top cover health insurance. So it is no wonder people are choosing not to take out top cover health insurance when they are going to be hit with huge bills for which they have no redress. But if they saved their money, banked their money, or invested their money, they could afford to pay the bill themselves. These are the sorts of reasons why people have opted out of private health insurance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a problem when we add this uncertainty as to what people are going to have to pay when they do enter a private hospital. If people know and can negotiate beforehand with their fund&mdash;which gives them some power&mdash;and their doctor what the cost is going to be, I think they will then be encouraged to use their private health insurance, if they have it and so wish to use it, because they will know what their health treatment will cost and they will be able to budget for it, instead of just going into hospital and copping these huge bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to people who say that rebates are important to those on lower incomes that it is not just the cost of the health insurance that is the problem for these people&mdash;it is the cost of the health care when they actually go into the private system. It is very important for people to recognise that point and to recognise why tax rebates are not the way we should be going. As I keep saying&mdash;and we need to keep reiterating this to people&mdash;tax rebates would really be of biggest benefit to those of us on high incomes, and I do not think that is a particularly socially equitable way to be going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that the cost to the government if there were total tax rebates for private health insurance would be in the vicinity of $2.9 billion. Of course, the question that is then raised&mdash;we heard the interjection from the people opposite to the Democrats' proposals&mdash;is, but where will the money come from? Those opposite have not looked at where the money will come from in relation to this cost. At question time today a comment was made about a drought policy release from the opposition. The comment that has been picked up in the media is that the opposition will leave the costing till later. One can only assume that those opposite are leaving the costing of their health policies until later as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point about tax rebates is that they would send a clear signal to the medical profession to charge whatever it wants because people will have private health insurance, and the community would have to pick up the tab. Australia's expenditure on health is about eight per cent of GDP, which, compared with other countries, is very favourable and is not a figure that we would want to blow out. However, the opposition does not seem to care too much about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we are still waiting on Mrs Bishop to release the precise details of the opposition's tax relief plans including tax rebates. As usual, opposition senators come in here and have lots of things to carp about, be critical about and have personal invective about but nothing constructive in the way of what their opposition policy will be. Health policy is of extreme importance to the community, and it is something that people want to know about prior to their even thinking about how they will vote. </PARA>

Those were Senator Richardson's words. He knew that the waiting lists were totally atrocious.

There was about a 75 per cent acceptance rate in three studies that were done at taxpayers' expense, about which I asked for details in an estimates committee hearing, to show that there was a general acceptance in the community that it was reasonable to expect people to pay a small amount of money when they went to a general practitioner, and that this would reduce the number of people seeing a doctor when they really did not need to and the incidence of doctors asking patients to come back when there was really no necessity for it. </PARA>

I cannot remember how many health responses the coalition has had in the last 10 or so years nor how many health spokespersons it has had. Some of them, I understand, are selling Amway these days; others have retired to the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we are debating the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act Repeal Bill 1994. This bill repeals legislation which over the years has been used to raise an export duty against uranium to pay for the costs of, essentially, the Office of the Supervising Scientist in the Northern Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export duty has risen on a number of occasions since its introduction, through amendments to section 6(1) of the principal act, in 1987, 1988, 1989 and 1991. Currently, the duty stands at $1.30 per kilogram. The reason for the increase in duty on each occasion has been stated in parliament to be the need to move towards full cost recovery for the activities of monitoring and information gathering. In 1987 the increase brought cost recovery to 50 per cent; in 1988 to 75 per cent; and thereafter closer to full cost recovery. In previous debates on this particular area of legislation I have certainly supported the notion of full cost recovery because, clearly, if we were not mining uranium we would not need the Office of the Supervising Scientist and we would not then need to pay for this expense.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that, having been associated with the early stages of the Ranger mine through the so-called Ranger inquiry under Mr Justice Fox, having given considerable evidence to that inquiry, having gone up to the Northern Territory and visited this area before Kakadu National Park was created as a world heritage area, and having been part of the ACF push to establish that area, I was certainly very keen that the environment be properly looked after.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that when Mr Bob Fry was moved from what was then the Australian Atomic Energy Commission over to the Office of the Supervising Scientist I was rather doubtful about whether that office would carry out its duties in a diligent way and I wondered whether in fact it would be overly protective of uranium mining. But over the years Mr Fry did an excellent job and I think the Office of the Supervising Scientist has performed extremely well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, when one looks at the environmental protection which has gone on in the Northern Territory in relation to the Ranger mine, one sees that the environmental protection has certainly been of a much higher quality than that we have seen in the case of the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia where, as I think most senators would know, the tailings dam has leaked very seriously. Western Mining knew over a number of years that the tailings dam was leaking down into the water table and in fact failed to inform the South Australian government and any independent monitoring authority that that leakage was occurring. In the Northern Territory, on the other hand, I think we have had reasonably good environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now come to this particular piece of legislation which seeks to remove the levy from uranium mining. I think that in itself is a very interesting exercise because it says a great deal about the profitability and competitiveness of uranium mining, comparing one mine with the other, and uranium mining with other activities in the economy. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bills Digest</EMPHASIS> states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The explanatory memorandum to the Bill states that the abolition of the levy is a result of&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I think these words need emphasis&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the current uncertainty in the world uranium market, and the view that it is no longer an appropriate mechanism for ensuring adequate industry contribution to environmental costs of mining in the region.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister's second reading speech brings out exactly the same thing. Among other things it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, with diminishing exports from the Alligator Rivers Region, due to the closure of the Nabarlek mine and declining exports from the Ranger mine due to the poor state of the market for uranium, levy collections have become uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ranger, as the sole producer of the Region and the only one contributing to the levy should therefore not be expected to meet the full costs of these activities.</PARA>
<PARA>It then talks about the need for Ranger to be able to better compete with Roxby Downs or the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia where the export levy does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the fact that there is a marked difference in the environmental standards to which the Ranger mine and Olympic Dam have been forced to adhere. What we have here is the removal of the levy because the mine which has been able to operate with much lower environmental standards is able to compete unfairly with a mine which, through the Office of the Supervising Scientist, has been forced to maintain much higher standards. That indicates one of the ways in which this government is going for lower and lower environmental standards as a way of encouraging some of our export related industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is simply not acceptable. We must insist that our industries maintain not the lowest but the highest environmental standards. If that means the imposition of a levy on the mining industry which represents the externality associated with environmental damage and the picking up of that externality through appropriate environmental protection regime, then so be it. That is the appropriate, economically sound way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pick up another point which comes out in the minister's second reading speech. I have already quoted that the Ranger mine is not able to pay the levy because of the poor state of the market for uranium and that levy collections have become uncertain. I point out again to the Senate that, currently, Ranger has a five-year contract with Kazakhstan to import from it roughly one-third of the uranium which it puts on the market because that nation can produce uranium at a much lower cost than that of getting it out of the Ranger mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Tambling and others from the Northern Territory who have held out this marvellous bonanza of more mines, more profits and employment for Aboriginal people really want to address this problem, they should be concerned about the fact that here we have a mine in the Northern Territory right in the middle of an important Aboriginal area that could provide more employment. The reason it is not providing that employment is that the market for uranium is so poor that ERA is importing 30 per cent of its uranium from Kazakhstan, which can produce it much cheaper. I think that simply indicates&mdash;this whole piece of legislation indicates&mdash;the failure of the predictions which have been made by those in the nuclear industry who want to promote it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the situation in countries which have gone very much to a free market situation, we see that in the United Kingdom the Thatcher government sold the central electricity generating board lock, stock and barrel. It found that it could not sell the nuclear reactors. Indeed, no new nuclear plants are opening up under that private scheme. Similarly, in the States, under an open market system, nuclear energy simply cannot compete. In those countries in which nuclear reactors are being built, they are being built with very heavy government subsidies, not in an open market system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this also bears on another point which is of great importance. It was held out by Senator Boswell in his speech on this bill that somehow or other the opening up of these mines was going to produce a lot of jobs and that it was terribly unfair of the Democrats to in any way oppose uranium mining because what we were doing was impeding Aboriginal people getting jobs. I point again to the fact that the Olympic Dam mine in South Australia is currently contemplating an expansion worth $1 billion to produce an extra 300 jobs. That is $3 million of capital investment for each job created. Quite clearly, that is not going to produce the jobs that are necessary to solve the unemployment problem in Australia, whether it is Aboriginal employment or any other employment. The whole idea that an expansion of uranium mining is either going to be an economic bonanza for Australia or will produce very many jobs simply perpetuates a fraud on the Australian people. It is particularly pernicious when that fraud is being foisted upon Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that I made the other day in an urgency debate is that the figures from the international uranium mining body indicate that should the disarmament agreement between the Russian and US governments be fulfilled, the amount of highly enriched uranium&mdash;which would have to be diluted&mdash;which would come on to the market over the next 20 years would be sufficient to meet all the needs of the civil nuclear fuel cycle without any more uranium being mined. Again, the likelihood of an expansion in the market leading to the profitable and employment generating opening of new mines is simply not on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am building on what the minister has put down in his second reading speech, which I think is terribly relevant at this time when the Labor government may well be contemplating whether to move from essentially a two-mine policy to an open slather. I think it is also worth pointing out the figures which came out of the Industry Commission report No. 7 on the actual costs of production, bearing in mind that in June 1994 the spot price for Australian produced uranium was between $9.20 and $9.30 per pound. The levy of $1.30 per kilogram which we are now removing&mdash;roughly 60c per pound which is coming off the price&mdash;is thought to be a sufficient inducement to Ranger to make a competitive difference. But the former communist countries are producing uranium at $7 to $7.20 per pound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IC report No. 7 states that the costs of production at Ranger are $15 per pound and $15 to $20 per pound at Roxby Downs. Of course, Roxby Downs is primarily a copper mine and therefore it does not matter too much what price they get for the uranium. The figure for Koongarra is $20 to $25, and $25 to $30 for Jabiluka&mdash;the mine which I do not doubt Senator Tambling will mention in a moment should be opened up. The prospect of that mine becoming profitable in the foreseeable future&mdash;and I am talking about a 20 to 30 year range&mdash;is really ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to a point which I made the other day. If the opposition is claiming that uranium mining should simply be left in the hands of the private marketplace&mdash;if it is profitable then investments will be made and if it is not profitable, investments will not be made; governments should wash their hands of policy&mdash;I simply point to two areas. It is not possible to maintain high standards of safeguards if one is desperate to sell a product at less than the cost of production. Under those circumstances one is forced to compromise on the question of safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a question to Senator Gareth Evans in October 1993, less than a year ago, I asked about sales of uranium to Taiwan and whether the government was trying to circumvent its own safety standards&mdash;that is, to fulfil the requirement that another party must be a party to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, that they must have negotiated a safety agreement with the IAEA and also must enter into a bilateral agreement with Australia. At the time, in October 1993, when the Australian government was attempting to circumvent its own safeguards agreements, Taiwan could not meet two out of the three of those safety requirements. Yet Australia was attempting to get Australian uranium to Taiwan via a third party, America. It indicates the lengths to which governments and commercial interests are forced when the producer is operating very much in a buyer's market. When the price that one can get for a product is less than the cost of production, it is extremely difficult to go in hard on the question of safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further to the matter of whether the government should leave its uranium mining policy simply to market forces, I again stress that when mining is such a high capital cost industry, when the number of jobs likely to be produced is marginal compared with the number of unemployed people in Australia, when the profitability is likely to be marginal, I believe the government has a responsibility to ensure as far as it can that investment flows into those areas which will be most socially beneficial in terms of production of jobs and most beneficial to the economy as a whole, so that the benefit to the country in terms of exports will be improved. Uranium does not meet either of those criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is just one other matter which I would like to mention. Fifty per cent of Australia's uranium is currently going to Japan. Japan is engaged in a program of attempting to build breeder reactors&mdash;breeder reactors which will get 60 times as much energy out of the uranium by breeding plutonium than the normal burner reactors that most countries which have nuclear reactors now are using. It seems quite likely that this technology will be developed in Japan. If that technology is successful over the next 20 years, it seems that the demand for Australian uranium will be extremely small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is another nail in the coffin of the uranium production industry. The demand around the world for uranium, including Australian uranium, will remain extremely small. In the meantime, the very fact that Japan is going down this road and that we are allowing the Japanese to reprocess our uranium to build up a stockpile of plutonium in anticipation of its breeder reactor program is one of the primary causes of the development of nuclear weapons in North Korea. Recently, we have seen the North Koreans hold the world to ransom and extract billions of dollars of ransom payment from the United States in return for not going nuclear. That again indicates the inherent danger of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we are not opposing this legislation, but the minister's second reading speech indicates the extremely parlous state of the uranium mining industry, and indicates yet again the reason why the government should not move from a two mines policy to open slather in uranium mining. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to rise and support the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act Repeal Bill 1994. We are reminded that this legislation has as the main features of reform the incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency; the refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders; allowing the Alligator Rivers Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the region on a commercial basis; and the conduct of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not share Senator Coulter's apprehensions or criticisms in this regard. I represent the Northern Territory where the application of this legislation has very direct and consequential effects. It has been very interesting to look at the history of the Ranger mine at Jabiru which is directly affected by this legislation. It was also very interesting that Senator Coulter did not outline any criticism of any environmental damage or problem at Kakadu or in connection with Ranger. I think it is a compliment that one of the environmental policemen of Australia, Senator Coulter&mdash;who sees himself in that role&mdash;did not come out and outline anything that has been wrong with the history of the development of this particular mine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we do review the functions of ERA, the mining company, and the Office of Supervising Scientist which has carried out work in this important environmental area, they can stand very proud of their record in this entire area of the environment. When we review the functions of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, and when we review the economic basis and underpinning by ERA&mdash;which has been required in the past to pay the levy that has funded the office of supervising scientist&mdash;we can look very proudly at the records of environment protection and the standards that have been maintained at the Ranger mine and in Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me look specifically at the operations of Energy Resources of Australia, the mine operator, and particularly at its environmental management record. It is incumbent on us to recognise that in 1993 the company was given several very credible awards in this area. Firstly, the company was given the award for environmental excellence at Ranger by the Australian Minerals Energy and Environment Foundation. Secondly, ERA received the landcare research award into environment protection at Ranger from Northern Territory Landcare. Those are two very significant, credible and hard judged awards in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also aware of a considerable amount of collaborative research with the CSIRO in the whole area of mine site rehabilitation. Similarly, the company has now developed a considerable bank of environmental expertise and it is in a position to gain commercially from selling that expertise and that operation to other mining interests in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in Australia. That is a credible record for a company that has now accumulated this particular skill in its own operation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we also look at the record that Ranger has with the National Safety Council of Australia we see that it is given the credit of holding a five star management rating&mdash;the highest possible rating from the National Safety Council&mdash;with regard to the whole issue of the safety of employees. This, of course, benefits ERA. It affects the company's rating for insurance purposes and has a direct bearing on the costs of operation. But it has to come from a proven record in the field. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, ERA also has a very active research program with the ANCA park operator of Kakadu National Park. They work in close collaboration with the traditional Aboriginal owners of the area and with CSIRO. This area of research is not specifically constrained or related to nuclear, uranium or mining issues. It is much broader than that. It covers issues such as weed control, salvinia, fire management strategies for the park area or that affect the park infrastructure, feral animal control, the breeding of local species of fish such as barramundi and sleepy cod, and a species of tropical emu. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These sorts of programs make ERA stand out with what can only be described as a relationship and acceptance in the community as a good neighbour and a very sound and competent corporate citizen. The respect which ERA and the Ranger mine are now accorded by Northern Territory government authorities, and the involvement that the company has with so many Commonwealth government agencies in a whole range of areas of regulatory regimes and cooperation, are a credit to the company and the mine. They are certainly an example to the rest of the country. No matter what audit procedure or review process are used, it is very evident that there is no detriment whatsoever being caused in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The company would be able to capitalise on these research and technology areas if it was allowed to expand into the associated project at Jabiluka which is now going under the title of Ranger North. That is an associated area of ERA's commercial interests. All of this accumulated wisdom in the area of the environment can be applied to reduce any impact of a development project at Jabiluka. I am well aware that the company has started research on underground mining, the managing of radiation and radon, the monitoring that is so closely associated with it, and air quality control at that project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter referred to the applicability of the possible operation of the mine at Koongarra which is owned by other commercial interests. I am sure that those commercial interests would tap into and be able to gain from the knowledge and experience of ERA. As I said, Ranger is obviously in a position to sell on a commercial basis, whether it is at McArthur River, Koongarra, Century Mine over the border in Queensland, or for other possible projects in Western Australia. This whole area can be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why it is but the Democrats seem to have a paranoia, maintained with almost religious fervour, whenever anyone mentions the topic of nuclear energy or the uranium industry. I suppose it is a historical situation. To me, the way in which they look at these issues places the Democrats back in the 1950s. When we analyse and study the rhetoric and the language used in this area, we find that it is discredited economics. It is really very faulty logic with regard to the operation, be it market economics, environmental issues or environmental economics. For example, in talking about the job possibilities or potential of a mine, the Democrats always seem to jump about five or 10 years that would involve any development or construction phase. They ignore all of that and the compounding and beneficial results that flow through to any community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me tell you, Mr Deputy President, that the township of Jabiru is a very significant community in the Northern Territory. It is there because of one initial starting point: the establishment of the Ranger mine. From that has evolved a very comprehensive system of local government, of community, of services to Aboriginal people, of services to the tourist industry and of infrastructure support in the area of health and so many other government services. That whole township of Jabiru has grown out of the economics of starting a particular mine in a particular community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the Aboriginal people have come to a realisation of the benefits that happen when a mine is properly developed with the proud historical and environmental record that Ranger can boast about and they can see these other benefits that flow through to their particular communities. Therefore, I find it a strange irony that the social policies of the Australian Democrats are riddled with inconsistencies when it comes to addressing the issues that the Aboriginal people of the particular area might or should want to address. They are quite mature in the decision-making processes. They are well aware of the problems of urbanisation, whether it is in Darwin or in Jabiru. They have behind them the resources of a community and a company that can assist in those necessary changes in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter advanced arguments with regard to competitiveness. Again, it is a strange irony that we have had a competitive situation that has been totally frustrated because of an irrational and stupid three-mine uranium policy. From the debate we had last week on the uranium position, I can understand the position that Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette would probably take. They have a very fundamental debate with us on the issue and from their position they say, `No mines.' I am saying quite the reverse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have become a scrambled egg in the middle of this debate. They stood in this chamber last week and said that they just wanted to maintain the three-mine policy. That is not a debate in any way whatsoever. Yes, there is a straight debate between the Greens and ourselves. It is based on points of principle and economics, and therefore I can quite appreciate that. But the way in which Senator Coulter and the Democrats have gone into what I can only call a scrambled egg situation with this issue also reflects the dilemma that is within the current Labor Party policies. The Democrats are nothing more than a totally wandering and lost faction of the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we have seen, the Labor Party is now hopelessly and totally confused in the debate on the whole issue of its uranium policy, which it has to address next month. We must challenge the Labor Party to take a firm and decisive view. I would argue very strongly that the Australian community is sending a very strong and positive signal to the Australian Labor Party to drop its three-mine uranium policy and to adopt a much more open basis. There are sufficient regulations, controls, legislation and international arrangements in place with regard to the protection of and necessary safeguards for the environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever Senator Coulter picks out of his lucky dip bin examples of the energy policies of Taiwan, or the technology coming out of Japan, or uranium coming from other sources such as Russia, or the fears about Korea, he needs to put them into the proper international context of those controls that very properly exist. Australia needs to be a partner in all of those particular areas, just as it must be competitive in all aspects of the marketing of a resource that we have available. I strongly say to the Australian Labor Party that it is incumbent on that party, at its policy conference next month, to change its policy to be consistent for Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it is going to adopt an argument based on Aboriginal issues for a mine such as Coronation Hill, it must also listen when those Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory, who are the owners of the resource, give a statement of intent as traditional owners. The Labor Party has to be consistent in the message and not put one group of Aborigines on one side of a fence and others on the other side, as it does with its marginal seat strategies everywhere else around Australia. That is the type of horse trading that the Labor Party is doing on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are good controls. When we look at the record of what this legislation is here to achieve, I am pleased to see that the levy is being dropped off one particular mine. As Senator Coulter acknowledged, it is not being applied as a levy to Roxby Downs in South Australia. Whilst there are issues affecting the Kakadu National Park, which is an important national park to which we are all committed, again the equity and the funding ought to be there. ERA and Ranger have proved that they are good corporate citizens within a national park. They have proved through their record of investment&mdash;not only in development, but also in the community and all the research areas that are so integrally tied up with it&mdash;that they can operate in a very efficient way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am confident that any other mine of this nature&mdash;with the sorts of arrangements that will be put in place with both the Commonwealth government and the Northern Territory government, or state governments if mines were to open in other states&mdash;would be just as effective as this mine in the Kakadu National Park. On that basis, I am very pleased to support the legislation in the anticipation that this is just a forerunner of the many changes in the area of uranium policy by the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The principles behind this Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act Repeal Bill are curious to say the least. It appears that because the levy currently payable under the act is not considered fair&mdash;because other mining operations, particularly the one at Roxby Downs, do not pay a similar levy&mdash;the levy should be dropped and replaced by a contractual arrangement. My initial reaction to that proposition is to suggest that, if Roxby does not currently pay a levy to fund environmental monitoring, it should be required to do so. The recent highlighted problems with respect to leakage from settling ponds at Roxby provides ample evidence of the urgent need for proper monitoring of the environmental impact of uranium mines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Uranium mining should not be considered in the same category as iron ore or bauxite mining, for example, because of the occupational health and long-term environmental impacts of this radioactive ore. Who is going to pay for the environmental monitoring at Ranger and Roxby for the next 10,000 years? Mr Jamie Pittock from the Northern Territory Environment Centre in a media release on 27 September 1993 stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The environmental threat from the uranium mine [at Ranger] is getting worse as it ages and will be more expensive to manage in the future.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Pittock then quotes from the OSS, the Office of Supervising Scientist, annual report of 1991-92. He states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At Ranger the expected environmental effects of a large operating uranium mine are beginning to be discernible outside the immediate environs of the minesite.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no question that substantial environmental monitoring is required right now and will continue to be required for many years to come. This is part of the hidden cost of mining this dangerous substance. If companies do not pay that as a levy, or if it is done as a one-off agreement with a company, over time there will be the means for companies to leave that cost to the taxpayer, which will mean an even greater subsidy for this industry than currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If companies do not pay that as a levy, or if it is done as a one-off agreement with a company, over time there will be the means for companies to leave that cost to the taxpayer, which will mean an even greater subsidy for this industry than currently exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I would like to raise in this context is that of cost recovery. Whilst I note that Energy Resources of Australia has entered a contractual arrangement to pay the sum of $1.5 million to assist in the funding of the Office of the Supervising Scientist, it should also be noted that the running costs for the OSS are in excess of $7.5 million. Yet again, the Australian taxpayer is contributing to the profits of Australian mining companies. The environmental monitoring being undertaken by OSS should not be considered as a luxury. It is an integral aspect of mining operations and the mining companies should be required to fund that monitoring. If, as I suggested earlier, Roxby Downs was also required by this government to be monitored, it would be possible to spread the cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What surprises me, however, is that this government, which is so committed to cost recovery, applies that principle in a very inconsistent manner. In the education arena, for example, there is a concerning trend for this government to apply the cost recovery principle to the very people in this community who cannot afford to pay&mdash;students. This government, which so often espouses the principle of social justice and concern for the battlers in this community, obviously thinks it more important to fund large mining companies and their highly paid executives than the lower income earners who are battling to improve themselves through tertiary education. Why is the mining industry also not required to pay its fees?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point worthy of note in this regard is the amazing comments of the minister in his second reading speech on this bill. In a discussion of the rationale for abolishing the levy, the minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . with diminishing export from the Alligator Rivers region, due to the closure of the Nabarlek mine and declining exports from the Ranger mine due to the poor state of the market for uranium, levy collections have become uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to know how the minister can reconcile that statement with recent comments by mining industry executives and fellow members of the ALP who have claimed that Australia should open up uranium mining in this country because of a strong international market in that commodity. The Greens will be opposing this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating here today the International Air Services Commission Amendment Bill, which proposes a series of essentially routine amendments to the act. The amendments would streamline the commission's processes, and have been welcomed by the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before 1992, Qantas was designated by the government as Australia's sole international carrier. In the One Nation statement, the government announced that it would permit other Australian airlines to fly international routes. It also announced that it would renegotiate Australia's air service agreements to enable more than one carrier to fly on each route&mdash;a policy known as multiple designation. The government has so far renegotiated 29 of Australia's 45 air service agreements to provide for multiple designation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The International Air Services Commission was established in that year to allocate capacity rights to Australian carriers. That was its independent role. The amendments in the bill can be divided into four principal areas. Australia does not have a formal bilateral air services agreement with Taiwan. The IASC is consequently unable, under the current act, to make determinations concerning capacity rights on the Australia-Taiwan route. The bill empowers the commission to make determinations concerning Taiwan by, amongst other amendments, redefining `another country' to include any region that is part of a foreign country. The bill streamlines the commission's procedures for approving and evaluating applications under the act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission is also required to make capacity allocation determinations according to criteria set out by the Minister for Transport in policy statements. The bill proposes to empower the minister to issue abbreviated criteria that would apply in situations where there was no need for the commission to undertake the full assessment process. This would include situations where: firstly, capacity was unlimited under a particular bilateral agreement, for example, on the Australia-New Zealand route; secondly, no submissions were received opposing the allocation of capacity; thirdly, only one application for capacity was made; or, fourthly, an application for capacity was opposed but not under all of the criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 9 of the bill would allow the commission to permit carriers to transfer their capacity rights to their wholly owned subsidiaries. The proposed amendment would rectify an anomaly in the current act which recently forced Ansett to create a new company, Ansett International, to run its international operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act currently requires the IASC to invite public submissions whenever a carrier applies for a determination to vary its capacity. The commission would, as a result, be required to call public submissions if a carrier wished to hand back a portion of its entitlements. Clause 12 of the bill would remove the consultation requirement for reviews in which the only effect of the varied determination would be to reduce the capacity allocated to the carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Air Navigation Regulations, a wide range of operational decisions such as timetabling must be made by airlines flying to and from Australia and must first be approved by the Department of Transport. Section 9(1) of the International Air Services Commission Act prohibits the department from issuing an approval that is inconsistent with a commission determination. As a result, Australian airlines must apply to the commission before they can make minor operational changes, such as running supplementary flights during peak periods. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill would permit the department to approve minor and temporary operational decisions without reference to the IASC. The scope of the department's authority would be delineated by regulation. The bill finally includes a number of miscellaneous provisions intended to streamline the day-to-day operations of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The establishment of the IASC was one element of the government's 1992 reform of the aviation industry, which was announced in One Nation and in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian aviation: toward the 21st century</EMPHASIS>. The IASC has been relatively successful during its first two years in operation. To date, the commission has issued about 30 final determinations. The only successful applicants for capacity have been Qantas, the existing international carrier, Ansett, and a freight carrier, National Airlines, which has been awarded unlimited rights to carry freight between Australia and New Zealand. The IASC awarded capacity rights on the Australia-China route to a start-up carrier, Australia Air, but its right to fly that route is in the process of being withdrawn&mdash;not, I might say, without vitriol, with the owners of Australia Air claiming that their financial consultants, Messrs Turnbull and Wran, have been in breach of fiduciary responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other start up carriers applied for capacity allocations but failed to obtain them. One company, Australia World, applied for capacity on the Australia-Holland and Australia-Greece route. Indian Ocean Airlines applied to fly to Singapore, and a start up company called Tropic Isle Air proposed to fly four B767s a week from Osaka to the Whitsundays. One consistent comment that the commission made about the companies' applications was that it was of the view that the financial projections were over optimistic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commission's view reflects the low operating profits recorded by international airlines worldwide. According to the International Civil Aviation Organisation, the world's international airlines, taken as a whole, recorded net operating losses of almost $US1 billion in 1992. It is said that the two years, 1990 and 1991, wiped out all the profits achieved by US airlines since the commencement of air travel&mdash;an incredible figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the commission is right to take a cautious approach to carriers' business plans. It is essential, however, that it is not too cautious. Small companies must be given the opportunity to develop innovative new airline services, but those opportunities must be balanced against the need to preserve the reputation and standing of Australia's tourism industry overseas, an industry which is so vital to the future economic development of this country. The coalition supports the bill. </PARA>

<PARA>In question time today, Senator Margetts asked Senator Gareth Evans a question in relation to greenhouse targets. Senator Evans said, among other things, that the government still has a commitment to the greenhouse targets, but he went on to point out that those targets&mdash;which include stabilisation by the year 2000, and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 20 per cent by the year 2005 compared with 1988&mdash;will not stabilise carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere, something which I think every honourable senator knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every honourable senator would also know, and Senator Evans alluded to this, that the work of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change&mdash;a panel composed of many hundreds of scientists drawn from a large number of countries&mdash;is firming to the view that the consequences of increasing greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will be horrific. We also know of the IPCC's recommendations that the 60 to 80 per cent reduction needs to be made as rapidly as possible. That indeed is receiving a great deal more attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have this desire to increase international tourism based on air travel in one little pigeonhole and, in another pigeonhole, we have many of the world's leading climate scientists saying, `Hang on. We are very concerned about what is happening to the atmosphere. We need to change our practices with respect to the use of fossil fuel&mdash;which, of course, would include air travel&mdash;and we need to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by 60 to 80 per cent as rapidly as possible.' This does not mean that we need to bring the level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere back to where it was in pre-industrial times, but indeed to allow it to asymptote&mdash;to level off&mdash;at a point twice as high as it was in the pre-industrial age. If one allows that Australia is indeed a very profligate user of fossil fuel&mdash;and if we are going to equitably share the ability of the environment to absorb greenhouse gases&mdash;our reduction, as a proportion of the 60 to 80 per cent of fuel use, would have to be considerably greater. </PARA>

I was interested to work out exactly how much fossil fuel use we were responsible for in that international air travel&mdash;just dealing with the air travel and leaving aside entirely the costs in terms of energy use of the construction of those very expensive aircraft, the ground travel that we were engaged in, the energy capital costs of the construction of the vehicles for that ground travel and all of the other things that we were responsible for. That is why I mention it in the context of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to put before the Senate a few figures. In 1991, Australians used 3,722 petajoules&mdash;10(15) joules. A joule is a unit of energy; it is one watt second. To put that into context, there are roughly 4.2 joules per calorie, and human beings need about 1,500 calories per day simply to maintain their physiological processes. That translates to about 6,000 kilojoules per day as the requirement for human metabolic energy. This use of energy by Australians of 3,722 times 10(15) joules would equate, if you divide the Australian population into that number, to an annual use by Australians of 213 gigajoules&mdash;213 times 10(9) joules per person per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will put these two pigeonholes together. Let us assume that the IPCC demands to operate in Australia and see where that leads us. Let us assume that Australians continue to use relatively more energy proportionately than most other people in the world; that is, we cut down only by that 60 to 80 per cent in line with everybody else in the world. If we are going to cut down our use by an average figure of 75 per cent, we would derive an amount of personal energy which would meet that IPCC target. If we divide that 213 gigajoules by a figure of four, we would roughly get 50 gigajoules per person per year&mdash;which would meet the greenhouse targets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned briefly earlier today, the drought which we are now suffering may be&mdash;no scientist is prepared to say that it is&mdash;due to the greenhouse effect. We may already be suffering enormous economic losses as a consequence of the greenhouse effect. We should be, in a precautionary sense, observing these figures very closely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we follow the recommendations of the IPPC, we have 50 gigajoules for use each year. Currently, aircraft use energy at the rate of 3.6 megajoules per kilometre per person. In travelling from Australia to four southern African countries&mdash;the same would apply to tourists flying from Japan or Taiwan to Australia and back again or to tourists visiting Australia from Europe&mdash;we travelled 16,000 kilometres by air. So in only three weeks we used 58 gigajoules in air travel alone. As I pointed out earlier, that calculation totally ignores the capital cost of constructing these very expensive 747s and 737s, the energy used on the ground, and the capital energy cost of the construction of the ground transport. So in only three weeks of travel we exceeded our annual allocation under the IPPC recommendations. Of course, that assumes that Australians continue to have available to them relatively more energy than the rest of the world on a per capita basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us is predicated on the idea that tourism is good and that therefore we will be encouraging more tourists to come to Australia. However, I am stressing the point that that view does not fit in with a greenhouse world. If we take this concern about the greenhouse effect and fit it together with what we will do in relation to tourism, large-scale international tourism does not become part of the solution to our economic problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that we could maintain a world in which people belonging to a small elite had available to them a relatively large amount of energy. If they spent that energy on tourism, that might bring some people to Australia and we might benefit as a consequence&mdash;but that depends on the maintenance of an inequity which the Democrats would not support. It is the energy equivalent of trickledown. Instead of dollars trickling down, energy would be trickling down from the energy rich to the energy poor. I do not think we should go down that road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the figures closely it becomes quite clear that mass tourism is a non-starter. It is about time that the government, the opposition and the bureaucracy, which recommends these pieces of legislation, start allowing the left hand to talk to the right hand. It is time that they started to look at what is in the greenhouse and tourism pigeonholes and brought the two together. If they do, they will realise that we must rethink our whole strategy on transport, particularly air transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism will take on a very different face over the next 20 to 30 years. It is not the face which this government and this opposition have been presenting to the Australian people for the last 10 or 15 years. I believe that it is urgent that we start thinking in those terms. It is urgent that we start bringing our greenhouse gas emissions into line with the IPPC recommendations at an absolute minimum. I believe that we can do it but I also believe that we must seriously change the view that we take of tourism, particularly large-scale international air tourism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1994 proposes amendments which would see some increase in the functions of the Merit Protection and Review Agency. The key amendments include a clarification of the agency's role in relation to the establishment of joint selection committees. In particular, it is proposed that the principal act be amended to make it plain that it is a function of the Merit Protection and Review Agency to provide heads of government agencies with services in connection with the establishment, constitution and operation of joint selection committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These amendments would facilitate the wider use of joint selection committees and appear to provide a statutory basis for the use of those committees in all agencies which come within the jurisdiction of the Merit Protection and Review Agency. They also provide for the Merit Protection and Review Agency to undertake specific employment-related functions&mdash;for example, where there is a spill of positions or to establish an order of merit at the request of both the Commonwealth department or authority concerned and the relevant union. Those are the two main amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the whole, the amendments appear to be largely of a technical or streamlining nature. They do not appear to involve any increased administrative burden for Commonwealth departments or statutory authorities. According to the government&mdash;the coalition accepts this&mdash;there is no expected financial impact stemming from the amendments. The Merit Protection and Review Agency's services in relation to joint selection committees are already generally provided on a user-pays basis. The bill proposes an amendment that would consolidate the agency's ability to charge for the services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the benefit of the Senate I will briefly outline the background to the Merit Protection and Review Agency because it is an agency that is not very well known but is a very important organisation. It has been around since the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984 provided for the establishment of the agency as an independent statutory authority responsible for handling the grievances of public servants and appeals relating to employment decisions. It replaced an old appeals tribunal that had been around for very many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, the Merit Protection and Review Agency's role is to ensure that personnel management practices of Commonwealth departments and authorities reflect accepted principles for human resource management, including fairness, equity, ethics and accountability. It is also there to protect the rights of individual Commonwealth employees without limiting the ability of Commonwealth managers to conform with sound personnel management practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing functions of the Merit Protection and Review Agency and its review committees, of which there are several, are similar in nature to the administrative review functions of the Ombudsman and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Generally, the jurisdiction of these two bodies does not include Commonwealth employment matters. Review committees currently able to be established by the Merit Protection and Review Agency include disciplinary review committees, redeployment and retirement appeal committees, promotion appeal committees, reappointment review committees and reintegration assessment committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the key amendments proposed relate to the establishment and operation of joint selection committees. For some years, the government has sought to encourage more widespread use of joint selection committees as a means of streamlining selection processes in the Commonwealth public sector. In the past, use of these joint selection committees has been resisted by staff organisations because there is generally no right of appeal or review other than to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1992, however, as part of the service-wide enterprise bargaining process, the government and relevant unions agreed to extend the use of joint selection committees in an effort to improve the efficiency and cost effectiveness of selection processes. Since then, these joint selection committees have benefited from more widespread acceptance and the number of transfers and promotions handled in this way has increased quite significantly. In the last year for which I have figures, 1992-93, the number of cases handled in this way was 1,578, which was up from 738 in the preceding year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under current arrangements, the joint selection committees operate as independent statutory committees established under the Public Service Act or, in some cases, under legislation governing statutory authorities. While internal Merit Protection and Review Agency guidelines exist with regard to the operation of joint selection committees, at present there is no formal provision for the issuance of such guidelines. The amendments relate also in part to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition supports the legislation. The issue of greatest concern is the possibility that some of the proposed amendments may expose the Merit Protection and Review Agency to a range of new pressures and work practices not commonly faced by a reviewing authority. However, I think at this stage such concerns should not be overstated, provided that the agency maintains an arms-length involvement and, through that, resolves any conflict of interest. We will watch the results of the amendments carefully. They will need monitoring in the light of their scope, but the amendments are largely of a technical or streamlining nature. We will be supporting the bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Environment, Sport and Territories Legislation Amendment Bill amends several acts. The coalition will be supporting those amendments generally. The bill amends the Christmas Island Act 1958 and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955. Those islands are Commonwealth territories and are subject to Commonwealth and certain Western Australian laws. The amendments provided in this legislation allow power now exclusively in the hands of the minister to be vested in the minister. This means that the power can now be exercised by another minister who is a member of the Executive Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is relatively simple, but I would like to make some comments in passing in relation to both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. As you are aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, a joint committee consisting of, amongst others, your good self, Senator Reid and me is currently looking into certain freight handling difficulties in Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It is not appropriate for me to talk about those matters prior to the bringing down of the report by the joint committee, and I am aware that that will be happening within the next couple of months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By making reference to Western Australian laws, just in passing I wish to flag a matter which has concerned some of us who have been interested in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands, and it relates to the power of the Cocos Islands Cooperative and also the interrelationship between the cooperative and the Cocos Islands Council. Since the Cocos (Keeling) Islands have come to be subjected to Western Australian laws&mdash;particularly those relating to local government&mdash;it is interesting to look very closely, which I know the department is doing, at whether there is the possibility of conflicts of interest in members of the Cocos Islands Cooperative also being members of the Cocos Islands Council and whether that is in some way a breach of the Western Australian law relating to local government. It is good to see that in both Christmas Island and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands regular local governments are now operating under the auspices of the Western Australian law. I envisage that a lot of progress will ensue in both of those territories with some recent rearrangements of the laws under which they operate. </PARA>

I understand that people in the South Australian Labor Party have to do all sorts of shabby little deals&mdash;particularly if they are ministers and want to maintain their spot in the ministry. If Senator Schacht does not do that, if he is not able to get involved in these shabby little deals, he will become an endangered species, and no longer will we have Foghorn Leghorns, to quote Mr Keating, in this particular chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Endangered Species Protection Act has amendments which clarify the term`Commonwealth agency' under the act so that the term does not apply to any person in the ACT, Northern Territory or Norfolk Island or persons appointed under specific legislation. Amendments also clear up some inconsistencies in the definition of `ecological community'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other matters involving endangered species that I wish to just briefly comment upon as we deal with this bill is the situation in Queensland where it appears as though at times there are different rules in relation to endangered species. There seems to be a situation where people belonging to the Aboriginal and Islander community are not subjected to restrictions on the hunting of endangered species. That always seems to me to be a bit unusual in that I would have thought that if a species is endangered it is endangered no matter who is dealing with it and who is destroying it. When the government is looking at endangered species legislation I ask that it bear in mind that if a species is endangered it is endangered no matter what the racial origin of the people who are taking that species is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to raise an issue about the beche-de-mer industry in Far North Queensland. That species at times&mdash;throughout the history of white settlement in Australia, I might say&mdash;has been said to be one that is in danger of being completely destroyed. I understand that the Queensland government, which really is in charge of the beche-de-mer industry and its regulation, is in the process of looking very closely at the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People in the industry have told me recently that there is a huge illegal trade in beche-de-mer. A quota is set by the Queensland government of about 500 tonnes per annum, and that is to be taken by about 24 licence holders. Unfortunately, only about a quarter of the licence holders actually use their licences to harvest beche-de-mer. That means that the processors, who run a multi-million dollar industry in Cairns&mdash;an industry that exported from Cairns last year almost $10 million&mdash;are having real problems in not being able to get in sufficient product because not sufficient of the licence holders are actually harvesting the beche-de-mer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the 500 tonne legal limit is being exceeded by almost three times, as I understand it, by illegal poaching of beche-de-mer. If this illegal poaching of beche-de-mer continues unabated, that species of sea slug could well become a species that in Australian waters no longer exists. Having being told by industry people that the illegal poaching of beche-de-mer is well known in the industry, I am very concerned that it should be known to operatives of the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, which oversees that industry, but for some reason nothing is being done about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that is correct, it is a scandalous situation and one which requires immediate address by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries. Illegal poaching can well destroy that industry. In fact, industry sources have said to me that the industry&mdash;and, I repeat, $10 million export from the Cairns area&mdash;could well be finished by Christmas time if illegal poaching is allowed to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act. Amongst other things, the amendments replace the old name of Uluru National Park with the new name of Uluru Katajuta National Park, and we in the coalition support that as well. When talking about national parks, Mr Acting Deputy President, I should also say that as to the rainforest areas of far North Queensland&mdash;and you as a Queenslander and others here would also be aware of this&mdash;the skyrail project was approved by the Queensland government some time ago, subject to stringent environmental conditions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, during estimates, I asked of the National Capital Planning Authority what was the status of that report that was being prepared to advise the government on whether something would be done to those illegal&mdash;and Senator Bolkus did tell me they were illegal&mdash;and ramshackle buildings on the lawns in front of old Parliament House. The National Capital Planning Authority told me on 23 June this year that a report had been prepared and presented to the minister but that, as the minister was still overseas, the report had not yet been considered or a decision made on whether it would be made public. I asked further questions and eventually said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the minister is not here, but I assume that when a decision is made that the minister will let me know.</PARA>
<PARA>The officer Mr Prattley said, `Yes, certainly, Senator.' That was a question I raised with Senator Bolkus on 3 May and I received the answer from him on 10 May and, here we are, some three or four months later, and I still cannot find out what the government intends to do about those illegal, ramshackle buildings on the lawn in front of old Parliament House.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> If this government is to have any credibility&mdash;it does not have any credibility, but one would think it is there to manage our country&mdash;and things are happening illegally that it knows about and sees every day, then it should do something about it. I cannot even get an answer from the government about its intentions or about what the report specified that the minister called for in relation to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again ask that the government let the parliament know why it is not proceeding to remove those buildings which, as I understand, have been built without permit. Maybe the report will show me to be wrong. I do not know; I have not seen the report. I cannot get my hands on the report. But I would like the government to say why it is not doing something about those buildings that are there without permit, apparently illegally. For some reason the government seems to be not too interested in them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the bill before us repeals the National Fitness Act 1941 as that act is now obsolete and its functions have been moved to other acts and administered by other bodies. As I said, the amendments and repeals of legislation contained in this bill are technical, are a matter of housekeeping and are non-controversial. For those reasons we will not be opposing the bill.</PARA>

Indeed, those people may be property developers who do not work nine to five. They may be share market speculators who in fact are competing with the skyrail and do not work nine to five. They may equally be leeches on the public purse in a different way. One would nonetheless not deny them the right to public protest if they felt strongly about it.

This bill is one which is indeed tidying up a number of loose ends and I do not wish to comment on most parts of it. I comment very briefly on the Endangered Species Protection Act which this bill seeks to amend. It seeks to amend the definition of `Commonwealth agency'. The act currently states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(g)a person holding, or performing duties of, an office established by or under, or on appointment made under, a law of the Commonwealth, other than:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i)a person who, by virtue of by holding that office, is the secretary of a department; or&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and this is the relevant section&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(ii)the Administrator of the Northern Territory or the Administrator of Norfolk Island.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the act already excludes those people from the operation of this act; however, the amendments seek to clarify that even further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to `ecological community' the act states among other things that a community is one which meets the additional criteria as specified in the regulations made for the purposes of this definition and may anticipate the necessary making of regulations. The amendments seek to add the words `if any'&mdash;in other words, to allow the situation in which the definition is fully met without the making of any regulations at all. There are two other references to the advisory committee, and there is a section which wrongly refers to a section of the act and that is corrected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I comment again, as I did when this endangered species legislation was passed, that this is indeed very weak legislation. It requires&mdash;here I would pick up from a different direction the concern of Senator Ian Macdonald&mdash;complementary legislation of the states. The states are not necessarily given to looking after their endangered species and this legislation contains very little in the way of protecting endangered species in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is within the province of the Commonwealth to pass much stronger legislation. As I have said many times, I believe the trade and commerce powers and corporations powers, which the Commonwealth has used, would do most of the things necessary to protect endangered species without involvement of the states. This is, after all, a national issue. It should not be left to the states. It is of equal concern to the people of South Australia if the beche-de-mer, to use the example used by Senator Ian Macdonald, are being overfished in the region of Cairns. It is of national concern and requires national legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I briefly make is that, even with the legislation we have in relation to national parks, endangered species and various other things, there is far too little resource going into the protection of important areas in Australia. We have world heritage areas. We have, to quote another example in Queensland, the proposed Hinchinbrook development on the edge of the Great Barrier Reef. I understand that we have one warden up there who is to supervise that very large area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was recently in the northern part of South Australia, the Lake Eyre region, which, again, the federal government has said that it wants to consider for world heritage nomination. In that vast region we have one volunteer ranger who is provided with a vehicle and petrol for that vehicle and who supervises an enormous area in the north-eastern part of South Australia. The main supervision of that one ranger comes from Hawker, which is 500 kilometres to the south of Cooper Creek and the Coongie Lakes. That is one of the important areas being considered for world heritage nomination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the weakness of the legislation, we are still not putting in the resources which will back it up. To that extent, I agree with the remarks made by Senator Ian Macdonald in that we need to put in a great deal more resource to ensure that the laws we do have are adequately policed to protect not only endangered species but also other species, to protect important ecological systems, and to protect in a sustainable way the Australian environment. As this bill is a tidying up bill&mdash;I am only using this as, in a sense, an excuse to speak of these things&mdash;we will certainly be supporting this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is now in a position to proceed with this bill. The States Grants (General Purposes) Bill 1994 seeks to authorise general purpose funding grants to the states and territories in accordance with the agreement reached at the Premiers Conference in March 1994. For the year at hand, 1994-95, the amount will be about $15 billion, which represents a 4.5 per cent increase over the funding level for 1993-94.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill is basically a standard bill which is introduced annually to provide the states and territories with general purpose funding from the Commonwealth. As such, it should be uncontroversial, although it is in fact a matter of considerable contention from year to year in terms of the amount, and on some occasions for other purposes as well. This year is no exception because again we have seen in this bill the Labor government's attempts to force conditions on grants which, of course, is completely incongruous and which is incompatible with the whole concept of general purpose funding, which is untied funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst example of that in this year's bill is Labor's efforts to enforce compulsory student unionism on campuses. This bill contains what I would describe as quite a perverse clause&mdash;and I use that word in the sense of it being an objectionable clause. It is also quite out of character with the general purpose funding nature of the bill and the whole purpose of this type of funding. At the committee stage we will seek to remove this perverse clause&mdash;clause 15. I am having circulated in the chamber a copy of the amendment which simply seeks to delete clause 15. But we will take that up at the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of states have introduced or proposed laws to introduce varying degrees of voluntary student unionism. Of course, as a fundamental matter of individual human rights, all unionism should be voluntary, and totally voluntary at that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Voluntarism cannot be partial, Senator Zakharov. It cannot be conditional. Either it is voluntary or it is not voluntary. At the moment, campuses enforce compulsory student unionism linked to enrolment. Failure to pay the prescribed union fee, which is up to $350 per annum now, results in the withholding of a student's results and a failure to pass. In other words, no ticket, no degree. That, I think, to most fair-minded Australians, would be regarded as a totally objectionable fact and certainly an objectionable principle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition, with its commitment to true individual liberty and liberalism, finds this situation abhorrent. At a time when students are often under financial pressure and the taxpayer is providing assistance to many through Austudy, it is ridiculous that a compulsory fee of $200 or $300 per student is compelled from all students&mdash;and `compelled' is the operative word there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also incredible that an institution which exists to further intellectual and educational development can be party to such a breach of freedom of association and thought. Student compulsory fees are often imposed to prop up inefficient services which can easily be provided profitably by private contractors, which is what happens on the more efficiently run campuses like the University of Queensland and the Australian National University. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fees are frequently also used to fund unrepresentative political activities. These usually leftist activities frequently include fat salaries and free travel for the office bearers. They involve high overhead costs, often quite extremist type publications, grants to unsupported clubs and, unfortunately, more often than not, a contribution to the National Union of Students which is simply a Labor Party front and which campaigns alongside the Labor Party during election campaigns. Those functions are a waste of students' money and an improper use of funds compulsorily levied. They are activities in regard to which students should be able to decide freely whether they wish to participate or not. No one is suggesting they should not do it but there should be freedom of choice to do it and it should not be funded by compulsory levies on students who may well choose not to so participate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students, by definition, are supposed to be intelligent, and they are. They can and should be able to make their own decisions and choices about how much and where their often scarce money goes. Honourable senators who really believe in either states rights and/or more particularly human rights and the rights of the individual, the rights of people, will vote with the opposition to remove this repugnant provision from the bill when we deal with it in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This general issue and clause 15 are representative of a greater problem in our nation's federal-state relations. That problem is the increasing tendency of the Commonwealth government under Labor control to direct, compel or override elected representative state governments acting on behalf of and in the interests of their electors. Federation unified our states into one nation. That process was formalised, of course, under the constitution. The constitution is a document of the Australian people, not the Commonwealth executive, as Labor would like. It is a document which sets out the responsibilities and the divisions of power between the various tiers of our system of government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective, productive Commonwealth-state relations have not been an area of success for either the Hawke or Keating Labor governments. Indeed, I would say without any fear of contradiction that they have been areas of quite abject failure and that has been at great cost to the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating), we know only too well that he is a power hungry, egotistical, egocentric centralist. He believes, in whatever area of public policy there might be, that he and the central government should have absolutely unfettered power to impose their views on every other Australian. Mr Keating, of course, has a long history of antagonism towards the states and territories. When he was Treasurer he used the states and territories as the means to reduce his budget deficit by slashing their grants whilst at the same time increasing his own expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1984 to 1992, in every one of those eight years, the government of which Mr Keating was Treasurer throughout that period, perhaps with one exception, cut financial assistance grants to the states in real terms. Yet in only three of those eight years, those three years being 1986 to 1989, did he reduce Commonwealth own purpose outlays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even in those years when he did reduce the Commonwealth's outlays he cut the states' money by more than his own. The proportion of Commonwealth budget funds going to state governments has fallen from 25.8 per cent in 1984 to 21.4 per cent this year. As outlays are currently $120 billion, it means a 4.4 per cent fall, which represents $5.28 billion. That is a great deal of money which is being denied the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that the states and territories have stable, sufficient and secure revenue streams to freely and confidently undertake the functions of government for which they have responsibility. The states are directly responsible for almost half of all public expenditure in Australia, yet directly they raise less than 25 per cent of public revenue. The balance is funded by grants from the Commonwealth, of which over 50 per cent under this government are tied to specific spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition parties accept that this problem&mdash;which is known by the archaic term of vertical fiscal imbalance&mdash;must be addressed as a fundamental issue of micro reform. Even Labor's former Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, came around to this point of view before he was knifed by Paul Keating and his comrades in 1991. Indeed, Mr Keating used the Hawke initiatives in this area as one of the reasons for the Hawke political assassination. Following that, the new Prime Minister, Mr Keating, quickly killed off any opportunity for long overdue reform in this area as it was totally incompatible with his own centralist authoritarian nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reform of federal/state relations was most recently discussed at the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, meeting in Darwin last month. Again Prime Minister Keating stonewalled on the issue of reform of financial relations, and again he jeopardised&mdash;deliberately so&mdash;real reform of a number of areas of national priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that a fixed share of Commonwealth taxation revenue should be agreed to be for the states and territories. That share could then be passed to the states free of covenants and conditions to be used by them as they wish and as they determine to meet their expenditure obligations and priorities. Such a proposal would give the states access to a steady broad based income growth tax&mdash;something which they have been lacking ever since they handed their income taxes over to the Commonwealth during the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The states' current narrow based, limited, inefficient transactions or values based taxes severely restrict the states' revenue raising ability. This proposal, which is similar to the one which was agreed to in principle by Prime Minister Hawke and the states in November 1991, would greatly improve the development of cooperative federal relations. It could improve the delivery of substantial other reforms which the states are hesitant to undertake for fear of losing further revenue avenues, and hence control and independence over their own spending flexibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not involve a new tax; it involves an extra tax. It does not involve anything vaguely resembling a state income tax; it is simply administratively and economically sensible and sound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in this debate other coalition colleagues will speak further on some of these items and I will leave it at that point except to say in conclusion that the reform of Commonwealth/state relations will remain an essential item on the national reform agenda until it is properly addressed. It is a very significant requirement that we have fundamental, sensible reform of Commonwealth/state financial relations and the other relationships that flow from and are linked automatically with the financial base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a meeting with representatives of the Business Council of Australia earlier this week I was interested to hear that reform of Commonwealth/state relations is now, in the view of the business community as well, one of the most essential items of reform that is required in this country. This issue will not go away and the longer it continues the more unnecessary duplication and inefficient administrative waste will continue to build up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the government not to let another COAG meeting go by without rectifying this problem. Restoring autonomy to the states and giving them the means and the ability to make decisions in accordance with the wishes and priorities of their constituencies can only enhance our otherwise successful diverse federal system. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At present, the Coarse Grains Levy Act 1992 (the act) provides for the imposition of levies on oats, cereal rye, sorghum, millet, maize and canary seed at ad valorem rates and barley and triticale at specific rates per tonne as recommended by the Grains Council of Australia (GCA) and, in the case of triticale, the Triticale Grain Association of Australia (TGAA) which are the representative organisations under the act. These levies can be increased by regulation up to a maximum rate also specified in the act. The levy rates for barley and triticale are currently $1.10 per tonne and $1 per tonne respectively. The levies attract matching Commonwealth contributions as provided for under the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change is being implemented at the request of the GCA, with the agreement of the TGAA in regard to triticale, and is intended to make the payment arrangements more equitable. The ad valorem levies proposed would ensure that growers' contributions to research are proportional to their net returns from the relevant crop. In other words, the amount of levy payable in dollar terms will be directly linked to the grower's capacity to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change will standardise payment arrangements for all coarse grains and also bring them into line with other grain research levies applying to wheat, oilseeds, seeds and grain legumes which are all levied on an ad valorem basis. The GCA and TGAA have recommended an initial operative levy rate of 1 per cent of the net farm gate value and a maximum rate of 5 per cent for both barley and triticale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with the change from a specific rate to an ad  valorem basis, any exemptions applying will now be expressed in value terms and all references to leviable weight have been omitted from the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change to ad valorem based levies is not expected to result in any significant change in the Commonwealth's dollar-for-dollar matching contributions in relation to barley and triticale as current specific levy rates were set at the equivalent of 1 per cent of net farm gate value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the new levy basis will take effect on 1 October 1994, if possible, to coincide with the commencement of the first quarterly collection period of the new crop year for barley and triticale. If the amending legislation is not effective by that date, it will not commence until 1 October 1995 to avoid changing the levy arrangements during a crop year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity is also being taken to effect a minor drafting amendment to the legislation which will avoid confusion that has been occurring amongst some levy payers regarding their liabilities in respect of oats and rye harvested prior to 1 October 1992 but delivered or processed after that date.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel compelled to take a few minutes of the Senate's time to draw attention in this place to the utter hypocrisy of the Labor Party and this government on the issue of the number of women in federal parliament. For many months we have been hearing Labor Party spokesmen, government ministers and others running around the country talking about how we must get more women into parliament and wanting to see a greater female component in the Commonwealth parliament. We have had Mrs Kirner and Minister Lawrence waxing lyrically about the need to get many more women in parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party, in its various state branches, has been passing motions calling for affirmative action and setting certain percentages to ensure fixed quotas of females in the national parliament. Of course, there has been some resistance from the Queensland Labor Party, Premier Goss and others, and this has caused some considerable division in the Labor Party. But, by and large, there have been proposals enacted to have affirmative action.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us on this side regard this with natural cynicism. The Labor Party has always attracted fewer female votes than male votes and has always suffered, relative to the coalition, in relation to the female vote. This seems to us to be a fairly naked grab for the female vote. I guess it is also a reflection of the fact that the ALP is well aware of the very poor quality of most of its male members and is looking to replenish its stocks by improving it through the number of females. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first test of this brave new world of having many more women in the Labor ranks in Canberra occurs with the  selection of the ALP Senate ticket in South Australia. In South Australia, the ALP went through the utter debacle of the last state election. It was reduced to less than a cricket team. This, of course, followed the incredible infighting in the ALP over preselections in that state. There was factional warfare, with the Centre Left and the Right combining to lock out the Left. It was a complete shemozzle and was one of the factors that led to the wipe-out of the ALP in the last state election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So national executive imposed rules were brought into the South Australian Labor Party. It had to have a certain proportional representation. Rules were put in place to give all factions their day in the sun. Of course, we had the proposals&mdash;now politically correct&mdash;to have quotas for females. I am not quite sure how this will work, but I think the South Australian Labor Party has a figure of 35 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That led to the question of the Senate ticket. The Left of the Labor Party has the state president in a woman called Ms Deirdre Tedmanson. Under the deal arranged through the national executive, she was to have the No. 1 spot on the Senate ticket. This caused something of a problem because the South Australian Labor Party Senate ticket for the next election also has on it ministers Schacht and Crowley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor can get only two seats at the next Senate election.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So with the Left demanding, through Deirdre Tedmanson, one seat, and there being two ministers competing for spots as well, there is going to be a big problem. I would have thought the ALP would be quite happy to see the end of ministers Schacht and Crowley, who are something of an embarrassment to the government. But, no, the national executive has waded into this and overridden its own rules that it effectively imposed on the South Australian Labor Party. We are going to see a deal done this Friday by the national executive of the Labor Party&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right&mdash;Graham Richardson has probably worked this out for them. He has decided that ministers Schacht and Crowley are going to have the first two spots on the ticket, regardless of what opinion is in South Australia and regardless of the effect of the rules which the national executive itself imposed on the South Australian Labor Party. Understandably, Ms Tedmanson is absolutely furious. We see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> today her on the record quotes. She says it is clear that `someone in the party thinks it's open season on ALP presidents'. She went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we introduced proportional representation in the conduct of ballots and the inclusion of more women, it was supposed to put an end to exactly this kind of factional domination.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope Ms Tedmanson stands firm. She says clearly in this article that she intends to, and intends to take this  issue to the wire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But here we have a classic situation: a prominent South Australian Labor woman who, under the new rules implemented by this Labor Party in the name of affirmative action, who should rightly expect to be No. 1 on the next Senate ticket and thereby increase the number of Labor women in the ranks of the Labor Party in South Australia, is about to be dumped by the national executive itself in order to save the scalps of ministers Schacht and Crowley. It is an unbelievable situation. It makes an absolute and utter mockery of all the Labor rhetoric about affirmative action. It makes a mockery of the Labor Party's professed commitment to having more women members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current situation in the South Australian Labor Party is that only one of the eight&mdash;there are only eight left&mdash;South Australian federal Labor MPs is a women, and that is Minister Crowley. Through the arrangements that have been put in place, there was a chance to increase the number of women from South Australia in the federal Labor Party by one. That has been completely dashed by this factional deal worked out and about to be implemented by the national executive to save our two erstwhile ministers who sit opposite us doing very little. This is utter hypocrisy by the Labor Party. All its talk of affirmative action of getting more women into the parliament is shown to be completely hollow by this outrageous factional deal which is making Ms Tedmanson a complete sacrificial lamb. She will be sacrificed in the name of a deal to preserve our two ministers Schacht and Crowley. The women of Australia should see right through the Labor Party  hypocrisy. The women of Australia should believe nothing when it comes to this Labor Party and all its claims about promoting the cause of women. They are dumping their own female Labor president in South Australia, who rightly expects to be No. 1 on their Senate ticket, to the political garbage bin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to bring to the Senate's attention tonight two new Telecom matters which have come to my attention since my speech on the adjournment last Monday. I will seek leave to table relevant documents at the end of this contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first matter is the extraordinary case of Mrs Margaret Prill. Together with her husband, Mrs Prill bought two adjoining blocks of land in Drummoyne from Telecom for the purposes of residential development. After a long delay with rezoning, they commenced construction only to find that $50 million worth&mdash;$50 million&mdash;of Telecom cables were buried under about one quarter of the property. The existence of the cables had never been admitted by Telecom and, indeed, it appeared not to know that they were even there, even though the properties in question adjoined the Drummoyne exchange. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that Telecom made a major error in selling this property and this is admitted in an internal Telecom letter which was inadvertently provided to Mrs Prill. Yet Telecom has refused to buy the property back and has offered what can only be called a derisory amount of compensation to the Prills for stalling their development plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prills have a large amount of money tied up in the property, leaving them unable to purchase further development properties to generate an income. The result has been financial loss and a large level of personal stress. A satisfactory engineering solution has not been found and they have been caught in an impossible situation through no fault of their own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very brief history of the saga which began in April last year and has yet to be resolved. Instead, the Prills have been subjected to the sort of treatment by Telecom which I can only describe as typical and indeed quite brutal. They have been misled, intimidated by aggressive lawyers and made to feel that this disaster is all their fault. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom has refused to take responsibility for an error which it privately admits is its own. I hope to table a letter Mrs Prill faxed to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee), a further note to ourselves, and the internal Telecom letter I referred to which admits Telecom's error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge the minister to direct Telecom to immediately buy back the property and compensate the Prills for the losses they have suffered at Telecom's hands. This is not a complex compensation matter involving intermittent telephone faults which are hard to trace and to quantify. It is a straightforward blunder by Telecom in selling land it should not have sold without making absolutely clear that the cables were there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I want to raise is a new development in the case of a Ballarat man, Mr Robert Bray. Honourable senators will recall that Mr Bray alleges that a Telecom employee rang to tell him his phone calls had been taped and broadcast in Ballarat. As a result of Mr Bray's complaint, he was referred by a Telecom manager to a local hospital for psychiatric treatment. In conversations with the Democrats, Telecom has stated that Mr Bray's calls were neither taped nor monitored. We were very specific in asking about monitoring and taping, and in both cases we were told that it did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning, a Telecom employee who deals regularly with the casualties of Telecom was at the premises of Mr Brian Love, proprietor of Lovey's Restaurant. During the course of the conversation, the employee, Mr Peter Gamble, admitted that Mr Bray's conversations had been monitored. Mr Love has reported this to the Australian Federal Police, who are investigating Mr Bray's allegations. Mr Love has also provided us with a statutory declaration, which I will seek to table shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These examples are completely consistent with the pattern of behaviour I described on Monday. And they are not historical examples. Telecom claims to be changing but there is far too much evidence that this is not the case, even amongst the people who are supposed to be leading the change. I look forward to meeting the minister tomorrow morning to discuss what can be done to shock Telecom into taking seriously its responsibilities as a corporate citizen and public utility. I seek leave to table these documents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was unable to be present in the chamber this morning when the Senate Select Committee on Whistleblowing presented its report. It is over a year now since the Australian Democrats, through membership of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and through its eighth report, first brought allegations by Mr Des O'Neill and Mr Kevin Lindeberg to the attention of the Senate. These allegations concerned irregularities in payments from the superannuation fund of the Queensland Professional Officers Association to certain members.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report tabled in the Senate today is relevant to the sorry saga of alleged official corruption and cover-ups. It is sobering to read the transcript of evidence provided by Mr Lindeberg and Mr O'Neill to the whistleblowers inquiry at a hearing held in Brisbane earlier this year. It appears that the recommendations made to the Senate by the superannuation committee have yet to be taken seriously by the Queensland government and its various agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lindeberg, in a statutory declaration supporting his evidence to the whistleblowers inquiry, indicates however that there is an investigation being undertaken by the Queensland Police Service Fraud and Corporate Crime Squad. In his declaration, Mr Lindeberg states that the police are investigating, firstly, an allegation of misappropriation of moneys held in trust in the Queensland Professional Officers Association superannuation fund by use of false pretences. Secondly, the police are investigating an allegation of conspiracy to attempt to pervert and obstruct justice, of perversion of justice, and of misappropriating public property and public moneys held in trust relating to and flowing from the shredding of public records&mdash;commonly known as the Heiner inquiry documents and tapes&mdash;on 23 March 1990 in order to subvert known litigation in which those public records were the central item of evidence. I seek leave of the Senate to table Mr Lindeberg's statutory declaration which post-dates the committee's report. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="XW4">Senator KERNOT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is important that the Senate understand the extent and seriousness of the allegations made by Mr Lindeberg. For that reason the events surrounding the shredding of the so-called Heiner inquiry documents ought to be outlined for the Senate and the public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lindeberg alleges that four years ago public records were shredded on the order of the Queensland cabinet to reduce the risk of legal action. The intention to commence court proceedings was known at the time of the shredding and there is evidence to this effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a solicitor's letter to the department dated 8 February 1990 expressing the wish to exercise a statutory right of access to those records within seven days. On 15 February the solicitors informed the department in writing of an intention to commence court proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 23 February four crucial events occurred: firstly, the cabinet secretary sought urgent approval from the state archivist to shred the records; secondly, the state archivist approved the shredding without checking all the material; thirdly, Mr Lindeberg met with the departmental head and officially informed her of the union's intention to assist the victim in his court proceedings; and, fourthly, the departmental head assured Mr Lindeberg that the records were safe with crown law and that she was still waiting for crown law advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 March the Goss cabinet ordered shredding to proceed in order to reduce the risk of legal action. The minister's private secretary inadvertently informed Mr Lindeberg of the secret plans to shred. Mr Lindeberg was then removed from the case only days later by the union general secretary on the insistence of the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 March the departmental head informed the victim in writing that she was still waiting for crown law advice. On 22 March the cabinet secretary instructed the state archivist to shred the public records. The next day the material was collected from the office of cabinet, taken to the department and secretly shredded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 18 May 1993 the minister informed the parliament that cabinet ordered the shredding and that the shredding was done in order to reduce the risk of legal action. There is no mention of the victim's anticipated court proceedings. On 7 September 1993 the state archivist informed the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine that she was not made aware that the material was required for litigation when she gave approval to shred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lindeberg, the whistleblower, was sacked on 30 May 1990, with allegations that he had threatened the minister's career. Mr Lindeberg went to the CJC which carried out two investigations. The CJC informed Mr Lindeberg that it was not an offence to mislead the state archivist. In summary, the career of a public servant was utterly destroyed. Mr Lindeberg has been out of work for 3 1/2 years, while he attempts to clear his name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of key questions remain: firstly, minister Warner stated that the cabinet allegedly followed the advice of the crown solicitor. A fundamental question is whether the crown solicitor advised the cabinet to shred public records required in foreshadowed litigation in order to reduce the risk of legal action against all the parties involved, including the crown itself. If he did, he advised the Goss cabinet on how to commit a prima facie offence of obstructing justice. However, if he did not, the Goss government is attempting to cover up its own offence behind a smokescreen of non-existent crown law advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, was the state archivist told by the Goss cabinet about the notification of the intention to commence court proceedings and that the Goss government wanted those public records destroyed in order to reduce the risk of legal action against all the parties involved? If not, then she must report that she was misled in carrying out her public duties. Thirdly, the CJC must be made to declare publicly whether it is lawful for the Goss cabinet to destroy public records required for anticipated litigation in order to reduce the risk of legal action against the crown itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Lindeberg's experience shows that whistleblowing is still a very dangerous occupation. It shows that anyone who endeavours to expose high-level political corruption cannot be assured that their case will be properly investigated. Mr Lindeberg's experience shows that corruption can still block all efforts to achieve justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Watson has noted, tighter prudential standards and other regulatory legislation have encouraged a number of superannuation funds to restructure. The Government welcomes moves to improve efficiency through mergers of funds in the superannuation industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Superannuation is an integral part of the Government's retirement incomes policy. In light of the important role that superannuation plays, and recognising that the current CGT rules operate in a manner which may affect the short run liquidity of merging superannuation funds, the Government announced a limited form of roll-over relief in its Superannuation Policy Statement of 28 June 1994. In that Statement, the Government announced, as part of its small contributions package, that it will allow certain eligible superannuation funds which merge on or after 1 July 1994 and before 1 July 1997 to roll-over their capital gains tax liabilities or losses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government remains of the view that capital gains tax should generally be payable as a result of a realisation of assets which occurs on the merger of entities. The basis of levying CGT is a change of legal ownership of an asset. Existing tax law provides CGT roll-over relief in limited circumstances and only where there is an involuntary disposal or, in the case of business restructures, where there is no change in beneficial ownership. As this is not the case for superannuation fund mergers, the CGT roll-over concession provided to superannuation funds will be strictly limited to that appropriate to the special circumstances of this case. Access to CGT roll-over for capital gains and losses that would arise from the deemed disposal of assets during a complete merger of superannuation funds will be limited to:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator Collins</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The major avenue through which the Government provides direct support for energy research is the Energy Research and Development Corporation (ERDC). Over the past two financial years, ERDC has committed $2.4 million to the development of energy storage research in general, including $0.75 million to storage research of relevance to electric vehicles (eg. batteries). Including funds provided to these projects from other sources, the total funding under ERDC for energy storage research was $6.6 million.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from ERDC investments, total Government funding also arises from grants made by bodies such as the Australian Research Council and the internal allocation of resources within public sector organisations such as CSIRO and the universities. Up to date information on total Government funding of energy research is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Corporation's investments in a specific area are dependent largely on the quantity and quality of proposals received in the particular field. Several energy storage proposals are the subject of current discussion. This year's expected expenditure, therefore, is not known at this stage</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) A major report by the International Energy Agency entitled "Cars and Climate Change" concluded that the greenhouse gas emissions arising from the use of electric vehicles would be comparable to petrol engine vehicles if the electricity used by electric vehicles was derived from coal fired power plants. Some 80% of Australia's electricity is presently produced by coal fired power plants. Therefore, any change in total greenhouse gas emissions would come from vehicles using the one-fifth of electricity generated from sources other than coal. The net effect of this depends on the electricity generation mix.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of electric vehicles in place of petrol engine vehicles would lead to a significant reduction in urban air pollution arising from emissions of carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Yes. There is no doubt that the public acceptability of electric vehicles would be enhanced if an advanced battery was developed which would extend the range of electric vehicles. However, other factors such as the cost of the electric vehicle and the recharging time of the battery, will also determine consumer acceptability.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Department of Primary Industries and Energy is aware of the arguments advanced in the World Resources Institute study and of other studies relating to this issue. The Department's assessment of research findings in this area is that there is considerable potential to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and urban pollutants arising from the use of motor vehicles generally. Greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by improving the fuel efficiency of petrol engine vehicles, using some alternative transport fuels (eg. natural gas, ethanol) and using electric vehicles which rely on electricity produced from sources other than coal. With regard to urban air pollution, studies conducted in the US suggest that it would be far less costly to address the problem by reformulating petrol than using electric vehicles.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Carbon dioxide emissions from the energy sector decreased by 2.9% in 1991-92 and by 3.7% in 1992-93, compared to the "business as usual" projections released in 1991 by the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics (ABARE).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Projected emissions under the "business as usual" scenario for 1991-92 and 1992-93 were 298.7 and 305.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide respectively. This compares with actual emissions of 290.0 and 294.4 million tonnes of carbon dioxide respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Emissions of carbon dioxide from the energy sector in 1992-93 (the latest year for which data is available)  were 294.4 million tonnes. Emissions in 1987-88 were 262.5 million tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Toronto target referred to in the question has not been adopted as an international commitment. In numerical terms, however, an average decline of between 2-3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year would have been required in the period 1988 to 2005 to reach a 20% reduction. This would have required an annual reduction of 1.1% of emissions over this seventeen year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) (a) An annual reduction of between 5-7 million tonnes per year would have been required between 1992 and 2005 to reach a 20% reduction. (b) This would have required an annual reduction of 2.4% of emissions over this thirteen year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) (a) Based on forecasts released by ABARE in 1993, a reduction of between 7.5-12.5 million tonnes per year would be required between 1995 and 2005 to reach a 20% reduction. (b) This would require an annual reduction of 4% of emissions over this ten year period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) Policies and measures adopted by Australia accord with our commitments under the convention. While returning to 1990 levels is an implicit target in the convention, it is not a commitment as such. Moreover, neither the convention nor our greenhouse policy response requires meeting a target in any one sector or any one gas. Both the convention and government policy adopt a comprehensive approach to include all gasses from all sectors. The following answers are given against that background.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (a) No data on 1994 levels of carbon dioxide emissions is available. However, based on the 1993 forecast, emissions of carbon dioxide in 1994 are projected to increase by 7% over the 1990 level. (b) Based on these forecasts, a reduction of 8.2% per annum would be required from 1995 to 2000 to reach the benchmark in the convention of a return by 2000 to 1990 levels.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NOTE: Some of the statistics used in relation to current levels of greenhouse emissions by Australia are subject to further examination by the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory Committee. The Committee is expected to release revised statistics by September 1994. The ABARE publication ENERGY-Demand Supply Projections on which most of the above figures are based, relies heavily on the biennial Fuel and Electricity Survey, which was last completed for the year 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Commonwealth Government and industry are developing cooperative arrangements to advance  Australia's national greenhouse performance. These will involve industry's recording and monitoring greenhouse gas reductions. The process is likely to include steps by industry to move, at the earliest feasible stage, to more efficient technologies and practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) The National Greenhouse Response Strategy (NGRS) was endorsed by the Council of Australian Governments (CoAG) in December 1992. It contained a number of measures in relation to energy supply that will impact on the adoption of best practice. These include co-generation, reform of the electricity supply industry and improved linkages between costs and prices. Progress achieved under the NGRS was reported in the National Greenhouse Steering Committee's Summary Report on Implementation of the NGRS, presented to CoAG in December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The adoption of clean technologies by power producers is the responsibility of State and Territory Governments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(12) Primary responsibility for decisions on responses to power generation externalities resides with State and Territory Governments. Victoria, in collaboration with the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Sport and Territories, engaged a consultant to report on externality policy. This important study was released in December 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister in his Statement on the Environment in December 1992 announced a National Externalities Study, which will assist in the identifications of costs and benefits not properly reflected in the price of energy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(13) (a) See (12) above. (b) The Commonwealth is working cooperatively with the State Governments to reform the electricity supply industry. The Commonwealth is strongly committed to the decision of CoAG to implement a competitive electricity market by 1 July 1995. The structural reforms proposed will remove price distortions (such as cross subsidies), which impede the pursuit of greenhouse objectives. A competitive market structure will ensure that costs incurred by market factors are taken into account and allow a range of energy efficiency benefits to be  realised, such as electricity conservation; promotion of growth in energy service providers; promotion of greater use of co-generation, renewables and remote area power systems; and provision for the greater use of gas as a fuel input.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(14) There have been no estimates by my portfolio of potential "no-regrets" energy savings (but estimates have been calculated for reductions of emissions of carbon dioxide by energy end users, see question (15) below).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(15) The effect of the first phase of the measures contained in the NGRS is currently being reassessed in the light of the latest data. In Appendix D of the NGRS, it was estimated that, by 2005, the effect would be in the range of about 10 million tonnes to 95 million tonnes below the previously estimated "business as usual" figure. In the projections cited above, ABARE used an estimate of the reduction, due to current NGRS measures, in carbon dioxide emissions of about 18 million tonnes by 2005. The NGRS identifies scope for further reductions of non-carbon dioxide greenhouse emissions and for enhancement of sinks of carbon dioxide. Commonwealth Departments are currently examining the scope for further "no-regrets" measures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 June 1994 (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> page 2440) Senator Kernot asked me a question without notice concerning Employee Share Ownership Schemes. The Treasurer has provided the following additional information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes to the taxation of employee share acquisition schemes announced by the Government were prompted by the emerging exploitation of the previous tax provisions which provided scope for virtually unlimited tax deferral on remuneration channelled through employee share acquisition plans.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 26AAC of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 was introduced in 1974 in the context of seeking to ensure that fringe benefits were properly subject to income tax. Since that time there have been major changes to the taxation system, including the introduction of Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) and Capital Gains Tax (CGT).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the broadening of the tax base reducing other opportunities for minimising taxation on remuneration, there was scope for section 26AAC to be increasingly used as an avenue for deferring taxation on large amounts of remuneration over long periods of time. Such opportunities were likely to provide the greatest opportunities for high income earners who would be in the best position to place large amounts of funds in employee share schemes for long periods of time.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, schemes had been developed which allowed participants to defer tax on remuneration through arrangements that did not involve employer company shares but rather operated as general investment vehicles. Such arrangements did nothing to encourage employee participation in the ownership of their employer company.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, the Government introduced a tax exemption on up to $200 of share remuneration a year to employees for discounts on shares in their employer company. However, there were concerns that this concession may have been unattractive to employers because:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax exemption was only provided on up to a 10 per cent discount; that is, in order to access the full $200 exemption employees had to outlay $1800 to purchase $2000 of shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the $200 was effectively clawed back through the CGT upon sale of the shares.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 26AAC therefore provided an inequitable tax deferral opportunity without a set limit on the amount or time of the deferral, as well as a $200 exemption concession that may not have provided </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">an effective incentive in promoting the Government's policy objective of encouraging employee equity participation in employee companies. Such schemes can have significant industrial relations benefits and can be expected to play a useful role in  enterprise bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The changes announced in the Budget will subject remuneration provided to employees through employee share acquisition plans to FBT as is the case with other forms of non-cash remuneration, but with two forms of concessions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Schemes which provide employee remuneration in the form of shares in an employer company will benefit from the following tax concessions: An FBT exemption in respect of share remuneration of up to $500 a year per employee; or tax deferral for up to 10 years in respect of share remuneration of up to $1,500 a year per employee.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This removes the scope for unlimited deferral that was likely to have provided the greatest advantage to high income earners.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The exemption concession has been improved to ensure it is effective. This has been achieved by making four key changes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum exemption has been increased from $200 to $500.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The maximum discount allowed has been increased from 10 per cent to 100 per cent, so that now no outlay by the employee is necessarily required.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of the FBT exemption ($500 in this case) will be allowed as a tax deduction to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CGT cost base will be adjusted to include the $500 exemption to ensure that the exemption is not clawed back by CGT upon sale of the shares.</PARA>
