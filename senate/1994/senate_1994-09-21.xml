<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion seeks to assist the smooth transition to the new committee structure. The Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration has had a standing reference for some years on the central administration of the Australian government. The committee resolved before its imminent dissolution that, as the performance of relevant departments and agencies is to be an inherent responsibility of the new Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, it was unnecessary to explicitly provide for such a general continuing reference to either of the incoming finance and public administration committees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The motion that I propose we debate today is important because we have had a great deal of discussion in this chamber about the drought and its implications socially and on primary industry.

The government is now starting to realise the inadequacies of the rural adjustment scheme. It is also starting to understand that there is a calamity going on out there as far as the drought is concerned. On the evidence that we have had from the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs&mdash;Senator Burns earlier today asked that the committee have more time to report to the Senate; he wants the committee to report to the Senate in early December&mdash;I think it would have been better to wait until we have seen the government's statement today.

I certainly do not object to her motion to suspend standing orders and debate the drought. I think it is an issue that needs as much debate in this parliament as possible. However, I say to Senator Margetts that perhaps it would have been better if she had moved this motion after Senator Collins had brought down his package today.

I think all of us in this chamber are genuinely concerned about the issues relating to drought and the effects that are being felt throughout Australia, and we look forward to receiving and being able to study the government's announcements later today. Many of the issues that are canvassed in the context of drought relief in this particular motion presented by Senator Margetts ought to be considered in the context of such a major policy announcement that is due and should be properly part of that debate and discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which Senator Margetts chose to raise this matter is, to a certain extent, opportunistic in just seeking to put on the agenda the broader issues that relate to the changing climatic conditions. If we look at the motion in detail, we see the problems of an agricultural sector facing massive climatic disruption and, in the last part of the motion, the concentration on the protocol to ensure the reduction of pollutants that may worsen the climatic instability. This whole issue is compounded by Senator Margetts's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it a strange irony that the Australian Democrats and the government would now want to join forces to pass this motion before we have been able to look at and properly canvass the solutions relating to drought relief, which is the thrust of part (a) of Senator Margetts's motion. There is a strange irony because of the pressures that are obviously now being exerted on the Labor Party through the Left and the debates and the issues that will arise at its conference next week. Also press releases, such as one that was issued yesterday by the Wilderness Society and the Environment Centre of the Northern Territory, canvass similar issues. That press release states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While serious for farmers, the so-called drought in the Northern Territory is, in fact, a normal climatic fluctuation. This region of the Northern Territory is one of the driest areas and up to three years without rain is not uncommon.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The availability of subsidies just encourages bad management . . . We should not further subsidise unviable businesses. We must keep people on the land to manage it, but only in the context of a major restructure of the pastoral industry.</PARA>
<PARA>I am afraid that if those sorts of issues are now canvassed by Senator Margetts's motion, then the government has a lot to answer for. Senator Collins, not only as the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy but also as a Senator for the Northern Territory, will face a serious debate.

<PARA>I would like to mention at this stage that notice of this motion was given not yesterday or this week but at the end of the last session. Those people who in the last few minutes have stood up and suggested that this motion is opportunistic, trying to jump the gun on the government's statement today, should be reminded that this motion was on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> before the government notified us that it would be making a statement today about drought relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is, therefore, important today not only to discuss the reason for this motion but also to discuss the links between it and the possible ways of dealing with this issue. If I had waited until after the government's statement on drought relief, the debate would be based on a to and fro discussion about particular government policies on drought relief and would be shying away from whether simply looking at drought relief is a broad enough way to deal with the implications for this country, particularly for the rural sector, of possible climatic change. That is why it is important to deal with this issue in this way and not simply be part of a reactive agenda or political mudslinging from one side to the other in relation to government policy or government reactions to a particular situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought has always been a problem in Australia. We have always been a dry country. But we have always depended on our land based industries&mdash;agriculture, horticulture and pastoral industries&mdash;to generate much of the wealth that this country lives on. Major drought has always been a problem affecting not only the farmers but the nation as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past, drought could be seen as a risk for the industry&mdash;natural variation at its low point&mdash;a time when farmers and the rest of us would try to survive until nature turned a more benign face. Recently the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) stated his acceptance that drought is liable to be the effect of long-term anthropogenic changes in climate and his concern over this issue. We note his words at this time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue is not to doubt that drought is there. Of course it's there and it's there probably because of climate change effects. What the Commonwealth Government has said is look, rather than simply this be part of the natural disaster relief arrangements, disaster means it is intermittent and unlikely and therefore when it comes it has to have arrangements which reflect those kinds of circumstances. Whereas what we know is with these climate change effects is it is much less intermittent than it was, it's becoming a permanent feature of the Australian landscape in one place or another each year. . .</PARA>
<PARA>He also said on SBS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">News Extra</EMPHASIS> on 20 July 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's view is it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>drought&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">should be treated under the Rural Adjustment Scheme programs rather than, say, natural disasters relief because it is not an intermittent disaster. This is coming quite regularly with climate change effects.</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, this is in line with the government's recent argument that drought would not be considered a disaster but the norm, and that farmers would have to adjust to the new conditions rather than be helped through a time of trouble because, until they adjust, their troubles will not end. That is the government's position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider for a moment what this means. A major drought event is liable to reduce our GDP, the measure of economic growth, by one to two per cent a year. It can result in the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs. This is the general impact on the economy from the agricultural sector alone. Direct losses of this particular drought are estimated as being in excess of $1 billion in lost sales. The general impact will be greater and estimates of the damage range from $2 billion to $3.5 billion with a reduction in GDP of over one per cent. As several commentators have noted, this is with the cushion of rising prices to partially offset the devastation of drought. Already this year we have heard that some pasta manufacturers will be importing grain into Australia for their product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motion before us today arose from the comments of the Prime Minister quoted earlier. He stated that drought was not an intermittent disaster but is probably a manifestation of climate change effects, and is becoming a permanent feature of the Australian landscape. I could not agree more. The Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change, which incidentally released a report in Geneva last week confirming yet again that global climate change is inevitable, has pointed in the past to the devastating effect of climate change on the agricultural sector. Evidence of this impact from the IPCC is contained in the excellent report produced by Greenpeace entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Climate time bomb</EMPHASIS>. It states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The warning signs are already here: 1990&mdash;world grain reserves drop to just 60 days after poor harvests, in the drought-affected US in 1988 and in India in 1987. California 1990 the five-year drought, the longest this century. By 1992 agricultural production is crippled and insect plagues proliferate. Voters rate water second only to crime as their main concern. Peru, 1990&mdash;the worst drought this century leads to food and water shortages. UK 1991&mdash;while total UK rainfall remains normal, the most severe drought since the turn of the century is withering southern Europe.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on and on about various sectors of the world and the specific impacts that have occurred that may be the worst this century or the worst on record. I have mentioned this before, but I do not think from what we are hearing that this is beginning to sink in. Officials say that the consequences of the drought will be `severe and permanent'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While many of these droughts can be linked to the El Nino effect, it is now believed that these events will become more frequent and more intense under the impact of global warming. It is also apparent from the Greenpeace report that the effects of global warming will not be confined to temperature increase and drought. There are also concerning trends that indicate that floods and violent storms and other extreme weather patterns will become more prevalent. The evidence is clearly there for everybody but most are too blinkered to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion for consideration today is therefore designed to acknowledge that climate change reality and to link it to the plight being faced by our farming communities. As many in this place have indicated in recent times, our farming community is suffering greatly. My concern is that the fundamental but admittedly long-term solution to many of those problems is not being confronted by either of the major parties in this parliament, and that the need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is the ultimate cause of the farmers' plight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like us to consider again the Prime Minister's words and their implications. If this is the effect of a drought, what will be the effect of such droughts becoming commonplace? It is not a crisis; it is a catastrophe of major proportions. When such a drought occurs, its impact goes beyond the years in which it occurs. Pastoralists reduce stock and it may take several years to bring herd numbers back up. Pushes to expand export markets are hurt and it may take years to re-establish them if inability to supply means that buyers find new sources. Capital in farms is run down and may take years to recover, impairing the farmers' ability to adapt, to buy, to maintain equipment or fences and so on. Again it may take years to recover from an industry standpoint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On an individual basis, some farmers never recover. They lose their farms and move away. Their experience, their investment, their capital, is simply lost. For thousands it is a personal tragedy. In this particular drought it is worse than usual because the drought comes on the back of an economy in recession, on the back of a recent history of low and declining primary commodity prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many farmers went into this drought scraping the bottom of the barrel, the bottom of their reserves, hoping that this year would prove good. Economically it has. Prices are good this year, but good prices mean nothing if one has nothing to sell. So the rising prices create a bitter irony about the situation of this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Take this situation and extend it&mdash;multiply it. Drought may not become a permanent fixture, but the implications of climate change say that it will come far more frequently and may start hitting harder. The good years may be drier and the bad ones even worse. Farmers will find themselves in this position far more frequently. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers live on a basis where economies are averaged over a decade, with good years making up for bad, living often close to the margins over that period. How will that farmer plan or build up to cope with a much higher number of bad years? Where will farmers find the reserves? One likely impact we should consider is that banks, already not very sympathetic to the realities of annual cropping and profits averaged over a decade, will look at the inevitable rise in failure rates and say that farm loans are risky and should attract even higher interest rates. The farmers' problems get worse and worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Things will get worse. News from the climate change scientists is that greenhouse gases are definitely increasing, and average global temperature is expected to rise by four degrees over some time. This is an average figure. The actual rises will vary a bit with location, but by rule of thumb we know that the rise will be least around the equator and greater as we go towards the poles. The temperature rise at the poles from an average rise of four degrees may be as much as 15 degrees, while the rise at the equator may be only 1.5 to two degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agricultural sections of Australia may experience rises of six or seven degrees. Four degrees, even seven degrees, may not seem like a lot of difference. Let me assure honourable senators it is huge. It is easy enough to change current patterns, wind directions and rainfall and affect the distribution of plants. It is estimated that a change of as little as 1 1/2 degrees average temperature at 30 degrees latitude may be enough to essentially reverse the ENSO, that is, the El Nino southern oscillation, which is the weather pattern that is frequently behind drought in Australia. This pattern has two main forms: the normal one and the one called El Nino, which occurs about one year out of seven or eight when conditions are right. Scientists believe that just a bit of global warming would mean that conditions will be right for El Nino most of the time and the other phase will become the rare one. This would mean that the drought conditions we are currently experiencing may become normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The kinds of temperature changes that scientists are talking about would mean changes in all kinds of climatic things. The gulf stream may disappear. Prevailing wind patterns may change. All of this will have an effect on rainfall. All of this will have an effect on setting of fruit and other plants, growing periods, distribution of weeds and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With climate change we are talking about adjustment of a similar sort on the scale of the entire agropastoral industry. If regions will no longer be able to grow the crops they have traditionally grown, what can they grow? Can they grow anything commercially? If not, what happens to the farmers in those areas? If large numbers of farmers try to change their crops and agricultural practices in relation to climate change, what will happen to the markets for goods that they are trying to produce? What security is there in prices for these new crops?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For how long will the new climatic conditions prevail, since climate continues to change? Can farmers adjust to continual climatic change, a continually changing environment? How can farmers plan? What possible security in price or crop output can they have? Without such security, how can an agricultural industry exist? Do we really expect farmers to deal with this all on their own?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we start talking about climatic change effects, we are talking about drought becoming normal in some regions, but also we are talking about a situation where climate changes continually in an ongoing manner. We are talking about asking farmers to adjust to a continually changing situation, about the loss of all security, about the weather or the long-term viability of anything they do. We are talking about something that may see the end of the position of agriculture as a central industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about billions and billions of dollars a year and a major change in trade flows. We are talking about the death of rural Australia, because without an agri-pastoral industry almost no-one will live out there. We are also talking about the death of an industry based on value added food products, unless we seriously believe we will import food for processing and re-export. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say here that I do not believe this is going to happen tomorrow. We are talking 20, 30, 50 years of erosion of the industry, of good years doing less and less to cover the bad ones. While this seems long in political terms, it is blindingly fast in terms of climatic change, and express train speed in terms of the work and commitment involved in establishing an area as an agricultural region producing a certain crop. That kind of work is not simply putting different seeds in the seeder and, presto, business as usual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the first place, farmers are liable to need a different seeder. They may need other new or different equipment. They will need different practices in planting and harvesting. They may need different practices and equipment for handling and storage. They will have to get involved in a whole new market, find buyers, develop relationships, build a reputation and so on. This is just the farmers' work up to the farm gate, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a region to get ahead, it requires more than just one farmer. The infrastructure must be developed; transport established appropriate to the crop and market, food industries or downstream processes established in the region; and support and service industries established for the new crops. Seed and plant stocks will be needed, as will correct types of fencing, equipment or whatever, and they will have to be available regionally. Rural communities are living, dynamic things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All of this will need to be considered in agricultural adjustment. For such rural adjustment to be done well will be expensive. If the conditions keep changing, the cost will escalate while any security as to return diminishes. Not to undertake such adjustment is likely to be far more expensive in human terms, in economic terms and in environmental terms. Environmental costs of not adjusting will include mainly degradation of land through attempting to make a go of a deteriorating situation, through over-farming and through inappropriate farming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the comments made by the Prime Minister that are referenced in this motion, this government has consistently failed to acknowledge the realities of climate change and to provide policies that respond to the very urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, we have the government regurgitating the arguments of the business lobby in this country that, because we are so heavily dependent on fossil fuels, we should be excused from the need to contribute to the international effort to reduce greenhouse emissions. What an astounding proposition! As I stated in a recent media statement, that is analogous to an alcoholic claiming that his dependence excuses him from the need to reduce his intake of alcoholic beverages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is not immune from such claims. The opposition consistently suggests that any efforts to reduce greenhouse emissions will cost the business community too much and that this will reduce international competitiveness. This is again a blind acceptance of the facile arguments of the business community. Mr Tony Beck of the Business Council of Australia is one of the key proponents of this propaganda. In a recent edition of the APEA journal, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For a country like Australia with growing energy demand and a dependence on fossil fuels, the potential costs of meeting stringent greenhouse emission constraints are high, both in terms of domestic economic costs and lost export markets. We need to be vigilant with respect to policy developments in other countries and need to ensure that domestic greenhouse policies are appropriate to our circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>I can only say to Mr Beck, and to the majority of senators in this place who appear to support his proposition, that the cost of not meeting our greenhouse targets will be very high from both an environmental and an economic perspective. Environmentally, we will suffer enormous climatic changes and an increasing prevalence of natural disasters such as floods and cyclones. In addition, this climate change will have an inevitable effect on vegetation and may lead to the loss of biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economically, we will increasingly find ourselves unable to compete on the international market as our energy costs and our energy inefficiency in manufactured goods remain high. Why will we have comparatively high energy costs? Because internationally many nations are discovering that energy conservation and efficiency is the cheapest form of energy production. This fact has obviously been lost on our political and business leaders because they talk about no-regrets options such as these, but they are not being pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, despite relatively high establishment costs, many nations are now acknowledging that renewable energy options are also substantially lower in the long term. Pursuing the renewable energy options also provides many export and domestic opportunities for business. Yet again, Australia has not been sufficiently perceptive to see the opportunities that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As indicated earlier, this failure to acknowledge the realities of climate change has been felt most evidently in the farming sector. I wonder if the Business Council is prepared to see the farming sector as a sacrificial lamb on the altar of corporate profits, for that is the inevitable consequence of the failure to take action on greenhouse emissions. Any compromise will only be a bandaid solution for both the environment and for the farming sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the government is supporting this motion, and has been working up a program for addressing the problems of farmers. We hope that it is not simply drought relief on the old model, since we agree with government that farmers will need to adjust to new conditions, and there is little point trying to help them hang on in doing something that no longer works, particularly if it only degrades their land further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we would like to see is a comprehensive package for rural adjustment, with particular attention to the need to adjust to the likely impacts of climate change. We think that the government needs to make a substantial commitment in this adjustment process&mdash;and we mean really substantial&mdash;not just some training schemes and a few information bulletins at the local ag department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Greens do not think that drought relief works any more does not mean we oppose emergency relief. Quite the opposite. This rural adjustment should have been already under way. Climate change is not news. The warnings went out from CSIRO, international scientific and intergovernmental fora and NGOs. It has been a major issue for decades. If the government has not heeded information on the implications of climate change, that is not the farmers' fault. It is hard for farmers to decide suddenly to move or to change their practice and put that decision into action, especially when they are trying desperately simply to cover the maintenance on their loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers are now in the situation where they are in a desperate plight. Even if we want to change agriculture, we need the farmers who have the background and commitment to the industry. We cannot just leave them. They are in a desperate plight and need help now, and the Greens support giving such emergency assistance to at least the extent of the old drought relief programs. We just think it needs to be made clear that it is not drought relief with the implication that it is a remedy for a short-term problem, but should be called something like `climate change emergency relief', so that people know what the score is. Such relief payments should also be used as a basis for determining who may be most at risk from climate change and be used in establishing the target group for rural adjustment work to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of urgency, there needs to be established under the rural adjustment program, or as a separate program, long-term measures to address the problems of rural adjustment to climate change. Strategies need to be developed to cope with the probable range of situations and difficulties facing rural communities. These should be developed with active participation of farmers, pastoralists, rural communities and regional institutions; and that participation should extend to inclusion in formulation of strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is important to support CSIRO and other organisations in providing better projections, it is important to realise that defensive adjustment strategies can be developed without exact details. For example, moving from monocultural production to more diverse production will provide a basic defence not only against climate change but against other problems such as economic overdependence on a single crop whose prices may fluctuate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Development of a more diverse and flexible storage and marketing system would also have other positive benefits. To accomplish these objectives and other objectives under the regional development section of the Working Nation white paper will require a substantial increase in funding to the rural adjustment program or some similar program; and a long-term commitment to such funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Coulter and the Australian Democrats for their support on this issue. I am pleased that the government has agreed to support this motion. I remind the government, however, that the environment movement is waiting to see a substantial commitment on this issue in terms of positive policy initiatives. It is disappointing that the opposition has abandoned the farming sector and is not supporting this motion. I trust that it will soon be prepared to acknowledge the realities of climate change and work together with all members of this parliament to find some long-term hope for the farming community and the rest of the population on this planet. </PARA>

Undoubtedly, we will have some opportunity to debate the package&mdash;whether later today, tomorrow or some other sitting day in the next couple of weeks&mdash;and express our views on it. Despite Senator Margetts's best intentions, I doubt that her contribution this morning, given the very narrow time frame between her contribution and the cabinet consideration of the drought package, will influence what is in that package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, there are some other elements related to drought. This morning I intend to make some comment on the issue of climatic change, which was specifically referred to in the motion. But I stress that there will undoubtedly be a major debate on the government's drought package that will touch on all the issues that Senator Margetts has discussed this morning&mdash;and almost certainly other matters. Minister Collins, other members of the Senate and I will make extensive contributions on these issues at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying principle of a national drought policy, agreed by the Commonwealth and all the states in July 1992, is that climate variability is a feature of the Australian farming environment. It is a normal feature. But that is not to say that the current drought, particularly in Queensland and New South Wales, is normal. It is anything but that; it is quite extraordinary and, certainly by any measure, is as bad as anything we have seen this century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under so-called normal drought conditions, good farm managers should be in a position to draw on accumulated risk management reserves. The exceptional circumstance provisions are intended to assist in those circumstances for which a good manager could not be expected to be prepared. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current period of rainfall deficiency is associated with the El Nino effect. The El Nino is an accumulation of warm waters in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean off the South American coast and the accumulation of cold waters off northern Australia. This disturbs the air mass circulation over the Pacific Ocean, leading to reduced rainfall over eastern Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An El Nino phase is associated with a sustained period of negative southern oscillation index, known as SOI, values; a relative measure of air pressure between Darwin and Tahiti. The SOI has been essentially negative since mid-1990 because of warmer than normal waters in the eastern and central Pacific. The present period of negative SOI has been exceeded by only one other episode&mdash;from 1911 to 1916. I understand that that was a period of major drought as well. </PARA>

There have been other periods of drought in Australia's history, but certainly the current drought and the one experienced during the period of World War I are the two major droughts of this century.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Queensland and northern New South Wales rainfall shows the highest correlation with the SOI. In the worst affected state, Queensland, 38 per cent of the state is drought declared. It has been experiencing essentially similar conditions for the last three years. In New South Wales, drought declarations now cover 83 per cent of the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had indicated that the Labor government will not abandon farmers. The government has certainly been addressing this issue progressively in line with the progressively worsening situation.

Obviously, that announcement will be made in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I want to touch on, which is dealt with in subclause (iii) of clause (d) of the motion, relates essentially to greenhouse issues. The government's response to climatic change has been effective in reducing emissions of greenhouse gases. I want to strongly rebut Senator Margetts's contribution in this area. The government has been acting; and those greenhouse gas emissions are well below what otherwise would have been reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia will bridge 54 per cent of the gap between our 1990 emissions and those projected for the year 2000. This represents a seven per cent decrease in total emissions against the projected business as usual scenario; that is, the without any measures level. This is a good performance and compares favourably with countries such as the US and the United Kingdom. It is harder for Australia to meet the implied 1990 target in the climate change convention because in percentage terms our projected business as usual emissions are higher than most other OECD countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recognises that there is more that can be done to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In keeping with the dynamic phased approach of the 1992 national greenhouse response strategy, the government is developing further greenhouse options, including innovative approaches involving the active participation of industry. Current measures adopted by the government to meet Australia's international commitments cover a wide range of areas encompassing energy and agriculture. Moreover, they constitute a responsible and balanced approach that reflects the need to protect our vital economic and trade interests. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier when we were debating the suspension of standing orders, it is rather premature to be calling on the Senate to be debating an issue such as this at a time when we are waiting for the government to come out with its drought alleviation plan. It is still debating it at the moment, I would imagine, in its cabinet. I would have thought that it would be better to wait and see what is happening, and I think Senator Sherry has said that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather sad to be debating at this stage something that will be scientifically looked at to find out whether or not there is a warming&mdash;I do not entirely agree that there is any real proof yet to say there is or there is not&mdash;because, basically, people out there are really hurting with this drought. This drought is not about looking at what will happen in 30 years time. First of all, we should be looking at how we can help the people out there who are really hurting at the moment. It is urgent. I think the urgency of the drought is what we should be debating this afternoon after we hear what the government has come down with in its recommendations as to what it will do about the rural adjustment scheme, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is at long last starting to recognise that there is a drought out there, there is a lot of hurt and hardship going on and that, if it does not do something at the moment to retain our breeding herds and our breeding flocks, there will be a dramatic downturn in revenue from our exports in three years time. I have said that in this place numerous times already since we have been debating the drought. The National Party and the Liberal Party have been talking in this place about drought and the problems associated with it much more than anyone else and trying to make the government aware of the problems out there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) even made a statement&mdash;it was just about the same time as he made the statement that Senator Margetts is talking about in her motion&mdash;asking why the National Party is out there shedding crocodile tears about the drought when it is a natural, recurring phenomenon. The fact is that drought does recur. There is no doubt about drought recurring. It recurs in different cycles and at different times. Whether there is any more frequency of drought at the moment, I do not know. Some areas of Australia last year had most probably better seasons than they have ever had. Other areas of Australia have had drought for four years. So I think it is very hard to work out what is happening in relation to the frequency of droughts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, of which numerous of us in this chamber are members, has been all over Australia looking at the rural adjustment scheme and how it is working to see whether or not it is working adequately, to see what can be done and to see what recommendations it can make. As Senator Burns said earlier today, such recommendations will be coming down in the first week of the December sittings. Hopefully the government will take some notice of those recommendations. It has not always taken notice of some of the recommendations that have been made. For example, we had an inquiry into drought in 1992 and, had the government taken notice of some of the things that were recommended, maybe there would not be such a problem out in the rural areas at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Drought, as I said, occurs sometimes once every five years. It may be that once every five years farmers lose a crop. It is once every six years in some areas. It varies all over Australia. There are major droughts. Senator Sherry alluded to when those major droughts occurred in Australia and whether or not they related to the southern oscillation index. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make another point about RAS, which we have been looking at, before I go on to the substantive parts of Senator Margetts's motion. A lot of people have been falling through the cracks in the rural adjustment scheme. I hope we find from the recommendations that the government is bringing down today that it is going to do something about this. Either people have been too viable or they have not been viable enough, or  they have been too profitable or they have not been profitable enough, so they have been falling through from one part to another. Obviously, people have been having trouble with Austudy. People have been having trouble educating their kids. I will just quote what somebody said to us at one of the hearings: `If you can't put food on the table, if you can't educate your kids as well as the city people, surely it is time for the government to take notice.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has taken notice. Hopefully in the recommendations that it comes down with today it will give help and assistance to the people out there who have all of the problems associated with the climate and everything else. In fact, the farmers have no meat on their bones at the moment. They have no fat on the meat of their bones. This is all basically because of this government, which in the last 10 years has gutted the rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before we start talking about this motion, we have to start looking at why the people in the rural areas are having so many problems and why they are crying out for help at the moment. Considering that the new drought scheme came into place in 1992, there has not been time for people to prepare for this drought. There has been only a short time since the government came down with its changes to the drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has the government done in the last 10 years that has really guttered the rural communities? We have to look at this. The government took away the effective IED scheme, the income equalisation deposits scheme. It made it so that people did not in the good years they had during the 1980s put away money in that scheme. There is only $137 million in that scheme at the moment. That is not enough money to carry people through because they were not given enough incentive to put their money in there. So the government gutted that scheme. The government did not take the scheme away entirely, but it changed and gutted it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the government do in the mid-1980s? It foisted the rural communities with interest rates that crippled people. Interest rates went from 12 per cent in some cases to 24 per cent. They doubled. People were giving away a quarter of their income every year in paying the interest on their loans, and remember that people in the rural communities have loans. Some people say they are net lenders, but a lot of the rural people have overdrafts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else did the government do? It took away the floor price of wool. I am not arguing whether it was good or bad, but the government took away the floor price after having said it would not take it away.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had commodity downturns, which I cannot blame the government for, in the rural sector during the 1980s. What did the government do? It thought that it had better foist a fringe benefits tax onto the rural communities. It was quite interesting when we were at hearings in the Northern Territory the other day to hear evidence from people that they are paying $40 a week on fringe benefits tax because they are supplying food to the ringers out in the mustering camps. Basically, I do not know what the alternative restaurants would be out in the centre of the Northern Territory. Are they under the gum trees? Anyway, the employers are getting slogged something like $40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government changed the capital gains tax and put in de facto death duties. This all applies to people in the rural communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government changed the depreciation allowances and took away completely the investment allowances. The government should have had that in place&mdash;it would have known that if it had looked at the recommendations of our drought committee&mdash;to make sure that people put up silos, sheds and other sorts of things to put fodder away, and put money away into the income equalisation deposits scheme so that people could have prepared for this drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government took drought out of the natural disaster area. Personally, it does not matter whether it is or is not in the natural disaster area; what really matters is whether government takes note of something that gets beyond the individual's ability to cope with.

Having done all the things expected of them, when things get beyond rural people the government should at least recognise that they have to be given some help or assistance. </PARA>

Does this government not realise that people who live out in country areas use a lot more fuel than people who live in the cities? The government slammed up the fuel excise from about 6c to nearly 30c a litre. People in the bush do not get any alleviation from this excise when they travel by road. They are being slugged by this government again. The excise put up the cost of the freight into and out of their properties. </PARA>

Now, under this government, something like $13 billion is being collected in wholesale taxes. Much of this tax applies to the transport industry and it is another slug on the carriage of goods in and out of farmers' properties. I have already mentioned the assets test for Austudy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to set the scene for where we are at the moment, I have outlined what the government has done to rural communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In her motion, Senator Margetts quotes a few things that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said on 4RK Rockhampton. Her motion states that, in the context of drought relief, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that drought is not an intermittent disaster but is probably a manifestation of climate change effects and is becoming a permanent feature of the Australian landscape . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister was condemned all over Australia by every person in the rural community for saying that drought is a natural recurring phenomenon. As I said earlier, droughts, little dry times or whatever occur about every five or six years. Maybe they occur every 10 years in some areas. Maybe in Victoria they never occur. People can cope with little droughts or little dry times. But every now and again there is a scorcher. The drought at the moment is a scorcher. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the government will announce today some sort of fodder scheme that will help people keep their breeding herd and their breeding flock alive. There is an animal welfare aspect to this because people in a lot of places are letting their stock die. I hope the minister is taking a little notice of this problem and that we will hear something today about that as well. If we let our flocks and herds die, what will happen to our meat exports and our wool exports in the next few years? Government senators are all smiling because wool prices are up at the moment.

<PARA>I can assure the Senate that floods are a disruption, droughts are a disruption, high winds are a disruption and terrible runs of frost are a disruption. This year some places had 30-odd scorching frosts in a row, which really knocked out the back end of what little grass there was. A series of very cold nights and heavy frosts knock the heck out of stock, too. Part (c) of her motion states:</PARA>

<PARA>I do not disagree with that. But I do disagree with the claim by the Prime Minister in the first part of her motion that drought `is probably a manifestation of climate change effects and is becoming a permanent feature of the Australian landscape'. I do not think there is any real proof at this stage, and I will refer in a minute to some of the evidence we had in 1992 on this matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts then calls for `a major commitment of funding to address the longer term structural problems of an agriculture sector facing massive climatic disruption'. I agree with that because this government has gutted this sector in the past, and it stands condemned for doing so. The government now wants to get into farmers' pockets. Instead of getting into their pockets, the government should get into its own pockets. It gives plenty to ANL. It gives plenty to its mates. If its old union mates need a bit of dough, it gives it to them. What about the poor old farmers? Why do the poor old farmers not get a bit?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part (d)(i) of the motion talks about the agricultural sector `facing massive climatic disruption'. Yes, there is climatic disruption at the moment. This very big climatic disruption has caused a big drought. Part (d)(ii) states:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me begin by pointing out that Senator Margetts's original motion was substantially amended by the President on the grounds that it contained very significant extracts of statements which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) had made. My own view is that, in doing that, the President substantially changed the motion. I am being kind to the opposition here, but perhaps that is one of the reasons why the opposition has not picked up the central theme which was well developed by Senator Margetts, that is, that the emphasis is on climate change rather than drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Brownhill that quite clearly those farmers in New South Wales and Queensland, in particular, who have suffered from drought for four years and who have had up to eight failures of crops are not, at this stage, thinking about climate change. What those farmers want is immediate relief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is the responsibility of this government and this parliament to take a longer term view, and therefore it is absolutely appropriate that Senator Margetts draw attention to the fact that this may well be not an extreme event in a normal cycle, but rather an extreme event which would be expected under a greenhouse scenario. Therefore, it is absolutely appropriate for this parliament and this government to be looking at that aspect in addition to the immediate relief which farmers are clearly seeking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a principle which has been clearly enunciated by the ecologically sustainable development working groups, and it has been enunciated more broadly in a number of publications, including the Brundtland report. That principle broadly says that, if one is in a situation where one cannot be absolutely certain of the consequences but some of those consequences are going to be potentially quite disastrous, then a wise and prudent person would take precautions to ensure that those worst consequences were put off for as long as possible until one had better knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One is absolutely surprised to hear the opposition say, `But we don't have proof yet that we are in a greenhouse situation.' My God, how long do we wait? Do we wait until we are hanging right over the edge of the cliff, about to drop into the abyss, knowing full well that by that stage, if we are suffering a climate change, the consequences will be so disastrous that there is no going back? Alternatively, do we intelligently recognise that the levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are increasing; that the rate of increase is accelerating; that all the climate models in the world indicate that that will bring about climate change; and that scientists have made reasonable predictions in relation to those expected climate changes? Looking at that, do we then take the precautionary approach and seek to slow down those changes as far as we can until we have a better fix on it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest to Senator Brownhill and to members of the opposition&mdash;I will deal with the government later&mdash;that a wise person would take that precautionary view, and a wise person would therefore be factoring in the possible consequences of these greenhouse changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do know is that the levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere have increased very substantially since the start of the industrial age: they have gone from roughly 270 parts per million to about 350 parts per million. As I indicated a moment ago, they are still increasing. I stress again: a wise person, looking at that global change and recognising that this is the only habitable piece of rock in our corner of the universe, would say, `My God, we should slow that down until we get a better handle on exactly what the consequences of that change are.'</PARA>

If those changes prove to be disastrous and if Australia's agriculture collapses&mdash;as Senator Margetts indicates may well happen under a significant greenhouse climate change&mdash;we have nowhere else to go.

We are animals with physiological requirements which I will get onto in a moment because that bears very much on how we address this question. We have also observed that there have been significant increases in methane in the global atmosphere. We know about the CFCs. Fewer people recognise that the HCFCs, which we are using to substitute for the CFCs, are also greenhouse gases, and they are increasing very substantially in the atmosphere at the moment. We should be concerned about that. Nitrogen, oxides and a variety of other agents are also greenhouse gases, and they are increasing in concentration in the atmosphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The model predicts that there will be a rise in global temperature. What do we find when we look at the record? We find that there is a rise in global temperature. No competent scientist is prepared to say at this stage that that rise is due to the greenhouse effect, but every one of them is prepared to say that the rise is consistent with it and if we were suffering from a greenhouse effect, this is what one would see. Moreover, as Senator Margetts has pointed out, the models predict that the frequency of extreme events is expected to increase. The area under the tails of the distribution curve will increase very substantially with quite modest changes in mean temperature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do we find when we look specifically at this drought? We find that we have had a four-year drought. The prediction is that it will go on into at least March of next year. When looking over the record&mdash;and I stand to be corrected on this&mdash;I understood that the drought to which Senator Sherry referred was from 1911 to 1914, and there was also one from 1939 to 1942. The drought that we are suffering from at the moment is an extreme event since white settlement by any measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No competent scientist is prepared to say that this drought is due to the greenhouse effect, but I am sure that most of them would say that this is the sort of thing that we would expect if we were suffering from the greenhouse effect. I come back to the point that a prudent person&mdash;evidently we do not have prudent people among the opposition&mdash;would attempt to slow down that rate of change in the global atmosphere until one had a better handle on the exact consequences and would not simply let the thing go until it was too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent predictions one has seen coming from the CSIRO are that, even with the most vigorous attention given to greenhouse gases, as of 1994 we will almost certainly double the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere as compared with what that they were prior to the onset of the industrial age before we can cause them to level off at some point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to predictions relating to the greenhouse effect, the very first paper that I have in my file is dated 1972. It is a very comprehensive and well-referenced document. I am reminded of the Swedish chemist Arrhenius who, at the end of the last century, pointed to the increase in the use of fossil fuel and the danger which that would pose to the world in relation to increasing the level of CO(2) and, therefore, that would have an effect on the global atmosphere with the sort of consequences that are now being more widely talked about. The</PARA>
<PARA>notion that this is something new that we do not know about is simply not true. Scientists have been concerned about this effect for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the cost benefit analysis&mdash;Senator Margetts has drawn our attention to this as well&mdash;we find that a number of people in industry and a number of right wing think-tanks in this country are saying, `It is far too expensive to address the greenhouse problem because Australia is dependent on fossil fuel.' However, taking into account the precautionary principle, the realistic way to do this cost benefit analysis would allow that this drought may well be due to the greenhouse effect. That would be put on the cost side of the equation and put against the fact that we are a major exporter of coal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were asked by way of an interjection earlier what we would do about coal exports. I have frequently been on the record in this place saying that the coal industry is a dying industry and, recognising the greenhouse consequences, we should be progressively phasing it out. We should not have spent 90 per cent of our energy research dollars on coal research, as this government has done since it came to office in 1983. The government should have been spending that money in other directions, developing energy efficient alternatives and renewable energy systems&mdash;and there are many of both of these. If we had gone down that road, we would certainly be further advanced in relation to being able to tackle this problem. Australia is a very profligate user of fossil fuel. We cannot excuse ourselves on the grounds that we are dependent upon that fossil fuel and, therefore, we have to continue on in that way into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point that I want to dwell on is the government's lack of action in this area. I contest Senator Sherry's claim that there has been an action on the part of the government which has reduced the greenhouse gas emissions compared with what they would have been under a business-as-usual scenario. I do not know of one action which this government can point to and say, `That action by this government has reduced our greenhouse gas emissions by this amount.' Certainly, during the years of the recession, greenhouse gas emissions have declined compared with where they would have been had we had the gung-ho economic growth of the earlier 1980s. In a peculiar way, I suppose the government was responsible for this with the recession, if that is what it is claiming. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I do not think for one moment that the government can point to any action that it has taken which has effectively reduced the greenhouse gas emissions in the long term in this country. I would certainly like the minister to point to any specific measures if he can. On the contrary, what one finds in this government is that throughout all of the portfolios&mdash;with the exception of the environment portfolio through the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner), who seems to be looking at the greenhouse problem&mdash;all of the actions that are going forward are taking no account whatsoever of the problem of the greenhouse effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention just one example which was on the news this morning. The Prime Minister of Australia met with the Irish Prime Minister and he talked about the desirability of tourism between our two countries. I was recently in southern Africa and I happened to do a few calculations on the energy costs of tourism. When one does these calculations, one finds&mdash;I was not surprised by this, I more or less expected it&mdash;that international tourism is an absolute no-no if it is based on air travel in a greenhouse world. If Australia is going to meet its greenhouse target as set by the IPCC of a 60 to 80 per cent reduction and be fair to the rest of the world&mdash;and I point out that Australia is a very profligate user of greenhouse gases&mdash;we would need to reduce the level by a great deal more than that unless we intended to retain for ourselves a larger proportion of the energy which the world uses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we cut down our greenhouse gas emissions by 75 per cent, we would have 50 gigajoules available to each person in Australia each year. Every tourist coming from Ireland to Australia and going back again or every tourist going from Australia to Ireland would use twice that amount in the period of their two- to three-week trip. I use this example to point out that the government goes ahead with the idea of tourism and totally ignores the consequences which that will have in the greenhouse area. Therefore, it totally ignores the consequences which that activity would have on agriculture in Australia through climate change. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will pick-up on food production. There is a long history of studies on the energy costs of Western agriculture. I will come back to the point that human beings are, after all, animals which require a certain intake of calories or megajoules each day for their sustenance. Like all animals, we are approximately 10 per cent efficient in energy terms. In other words, we require 10 units of energy taken in each day to put out one energy of useful work. In gatherer-hunter societies, obviously, we were very efficient. We took in a great deal more than 10 units of energy for one unit of output because gatherer-hunter societies were actually able to spend a lot of their time in creative activities away from actual food gathering and production. What does one find in so-called modern agricultural systems?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out some work done by Perelman many years ago, which has been repeated by a number of other people, which shows that for every unit of energy which appears on the table, say in Australia, five units of energy go into that production. So in energy terms our agricultural systems are very inefficient. If we were to do our sums in energy terms rather than in dollar terms, we would recognise that we have very significant changes to make. We have a GATT agreement. We have a government which is committed to the idea of increasing international trade and transport. One of the major energy costs of putting food on the table is the transport cost and that has been referred to. But rather than reduce the costs, one has to reduce the energy inputs and, in seriously addressing the problem of greenhouse, that is the way we need to go.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another example which brings it right home. We would personally use in our air travelling to and from Canberra from our home bases twice the amount of energy that we would have available to us in a greenhouse world. Are we going to selfishly retain to ourselves a larger slice of the energy available to Australia, or are we going to seriously look at the fact that we need to restructure not only the way we produce, transport and process our food but also the way in which we organise our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government has not even begun to think about these sorts of issues because it has not really grasped the problem of greenhouse, which is a major problem. It is a problem that really underpins everything else that we need to address in every possible portfolio in every aspect of our social life and our economy if we are seriously to come to grips with this problem. The consequences if we do not, as Senator Margetts's motion points out, are that we may well suffer these sorts of droughts far more frequently and we may see a major change in the whole structure of agriculture in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will emphasise another point that Senator Margetts made in her speech and that is that because we have one drought we do not change our agricultural practices. The uncertainty means that it is very difficult to change our agricultural practices. It takes a long time. We will have to have long and repeated droughts before we recognise that this is a permanent condition. In a greenhouse world the past will not be a predictor of the future. We need to think in different ways. We need to recognise the uncertainty which makes it extremely difficult for farmers and pastoralists to reorganise their practices on the land. It is not just the costs of the equipment and retooling that Senator Margetts was talking about; it is the uncertainty to which Senator Brownhill has already drawn attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by pointing out that in other areas the government is also pursuing quite the wrong course. We have recently seen processes put in place in relation to the national grid system, which is primarily aimed to make electricity cheaper. It will, almost certainly, drive the electricity system into generating electricity from brown coal in Victoria and from black coal in New South Wales, rather than natural gas in South Australia&mdash;a fuel which emits in its burning far less greenhouse gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government&mdash;driven by this economic rationalism and driven by reports from the Industry Commission and bodies such as that&mdash;is simply not looking at the greenhouse consequences of its actions. It is true that we will not get increased energy efficiency if we strive to make energy as cheap as possible and totally ignore the greenhouse externalities. We need to write those externalities in. We need to recognise that the cost of this drought may well be due to greenhouse. Writing those costs in will drive us towards the alternatives that we need to develop and there are many of these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the domestic energy area&mdash;one that I have drawn attention to repeatedly&mdash;the government has put a paltry sum of $6 million towards a solar domestic hot water system, but it is totally inadequate. What one finds in my home state of South Australia is that the Electricity Trust of South Australia is still strongly promoting the use of electricity for domestic water heating&mdash;something which is very inefficient and which results in enormous releases of greenhouse gas. Yet we have probably one of the best developed solar hot water systems in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have some of the best technology here. It is a technology which we are already exporting to a number of nearby countries and which could be increased very substantially. The costs, again, could be reduced if our domestic industry were producing more units, so the unit cost would actually come down. We have a number of manufacturers in Australia. They employ a large number of people. Very significant reductions in the domestic use of electricity, a very inefficient form of energy, could be made through that measure.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have put in place a proposal for ethanol for transport. There are exciting possibilities here in relation to a renewable fuel based on cellulose from waste paper, timber wastes and so on to provide fuel and enormous regional and country employment. There is a very good proposal in South Australia to use low value grain to produce ethanol for on farm use which, I hope, at least in the next year, will attract the bounty scheme and get under way. It will provide farmers with not just a cheaper fuel but a fuel over which they have some control and a fuel which they produce locally themselves. There are enormous opportunities. We are turning our backs on so many things that we could do. That would certainly not meet the IPC's targets; I do not think there is any technology we have at the moment that would allow us to get down to that sort of level, but at least we can make a start. We can certainly exceed the 20 per cent target which the government and other governments had set by the year 2005. In going down that road, via a suitable iterative approach and looking at where we are, at new technologies and at the change in institutional and social structures that would need to be put in place in relation to transport and a whole range of other human activities, we can make further changes as we go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we do that, we will find that Senator Margetts's motion is absolutely spot on. We will almost certainly see an increased frequency of these extreme events. We will need to pay enormous costs, which eventually will probably far and away outweigh any temporary benefit that we get from remaining wedded to fossil fuel exports. It really is not intelligent for us not to take the precautionary approach. It would be far more intelligent for us to recognise the real possibility that we are indeed going towards the abyss. We do not want to be hanging by our fingernails over the edge before we recognise where we are. We therefore need to put in place those measures which we already know about, which will substantially reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. We will therefore, in that process, give some longer term hope to farmers that these sorts of conditions will not be visited on them more frequently in the future. </PARA>

The whole focus of our farming industry today will be on the package that the government will be bringing down. That is why I say that is the main game today. Nevertheless, Senator Margetts raised some important issues which I found interesting from an academic point of view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter also raised some issues that need to be debated. But during his contribution today he hardly touched on the drought.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that this drought has been going on for four years. I first raised it as an issue on 21 November 1992. It was bad then and it is worse now. But the drought is only the third leg of the trifecta. The first was low commodity prices, caused by a collapse in the wool industry and the firm commitment of the government to stand by the floor prices. That commitment was supposed to be irrefutable, rock solid, set in cement and never to be changed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 13 occasions Mr Kerin went out and told the woolgrowers that they could rely on a floor price. The woolgrowers made their adjustments and planned their budgets on the basis of that agreement. Their financial commitments were based on the fact that Mr Kerin had said that the floor price would not disappear. When it did disappear that was the first hit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second hit&mdash;I think this is even worse than the drought&mdash;was the high interest rates that just sucked the equity out of their properties. They had planned on interest rates holding at 15 per cent but they went to 18 to 23 to 24 per cent, and that took the equity out of their farms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the third part of the trifecta is the drought. On 19 July the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) made some comments on the radio. Those comments have been incorporated in the motion moved by Senator Margetts and I do not want to repeat them. But the fact is that this government had to be dragged kicking and screaming into this drought debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 19 July it was just another drought that had occurred on top of all the other droughts that are always occurring in Australia. If it had not been for Channel 9 and the media generally dragging this government into this debate it would not have entered into it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> presented programs depicting, among other things, young farm children who could not get Austudy. That was one of the stories that led to the establishment of the Farm Hand appeal. But it is not the media's job to run a social welfare package for farmers, as welcome as it may be; that is the government's job. The role of the media is to report the events; the government is there to solve the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 21 November 1992 the drought was already bad. People were in trouble&mdash;they were being thrown off their farms and were losing equity in their properties. It is now September 1994&mdash;nearly two years later&mdash;and the government is only now about to bring down a package. Meanwhile, people have been thrown off their properties, looking for work off the farm, cashing in their insurance policies and selling their wedding presents and jewellery to keep their children at school. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, because of the pressure brought by Channel 9, by the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>, by the press gallery and by the media generally, the government was forced to act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My colleagues Senator Margetts and Senator Coulter have put forward some careful arguments and I know that Senator Margetts will deal with others in her closing remarks. I wish to touch on two aspects that are relevant and need to be raised. I refer to forest management practices and the impact of land clearing. The new report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that the world's climate is at serious risk. This should add pressure on the government to stop logging our old-growth forests. Poor forest management by both state and federal governments definitely adds to Australia's inability to meet targets for greenhouse gas reductions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well as having inherent value and great importance as a species habitat, the forests play an important role in absorbing carbon dioxide. The uniquely Australian issue of the contribution of carbon dioxide from the use of fire as a land management tool is also a matter of great concern, contributing&mdash;and here I speak of my own state of Western Australia&mdash;to carbon dioxide emissions by the logging of our old-growth forests. But as well as destroying plants and animal habitats, excessive prescribed burning increases an already unacceptable level of carbon dioxide emission. The Conservation and Land Management Department of Western Australia is further contributing by allowing a large bark dump near the Diamond chip mill to burn non-stop since 1976. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our forests in the south-west and in other parts of Australia have been under threat for some time. Logging and burning have resulted in the loss of our natural heritage and the extinction of species. Now we see that these practices are also threatening the `lungs of the earth'. If greenhouse gas reduction targets are to be met and forests protected, there needs to be a real shift in political will so that environmental protection becomes central to government decision making and action rather than secondary to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this to be achieved the government needs to stop logging native forests immediately and move to plantations. It should change tax and land policies to provide incentives for retaining and planting bush. It needs to seriously examine the use of fire in forest and land management and to implement its own policies for buying recycled paper products. The contribution of agricultural policies to greenhouse emissions should not be overlooked. The government's approach to supporting farmers should not only relate to immediate concerns and the impact of drought, but look to the long-term future of the entire agricultural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change confirmed that emissions of greenhouse gases are the main reason that the atmosphere's ability to absorb and emit energy is changing. When the environment minister, Senator Faulkner, released the greenhouse gas inventory he admitted that Australia would not reach reduction targets for greenhouse gases if only existing measures were followed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution of land clearing to greenhouse gases is unexpected and of serious concern. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the inventory, the energy sector is the single largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and emissions from land clearing contribute about half as much carbon dioxide as the energy sector. This was unexpected, but it should not have been. We need to consider the increasing amount of information that tells us that the impact of stocking and of land clearance on our agricultural sector has been disastrous in its economic consequences. Now we can see that it has global implications and that Australia has a strong responsibility in this regard because we have the scientific and technological information to address the problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also have the alternative strategies that simply need encouragement to be put in place. What we lack is political will. Unless we take a multifaceted approach to this problem, then Australia will suffer serious ecological, social and economic consequences. As well as developing strategies in regard to the energy and other industries, we also need to restructure the wood products industry so that alternative sources of wood and pulp for paper are further developed and used. Further, we need to develop agricultural policies whereby farmers are subsidised and given incentives for ecologically sustainable agriculture. The government should change tax and land policies to remove the present disincentives to retaining and planting bush. The long-term support for our agricultural sector which is embedded in Senator Margetts's motion is vital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell has called on us to speak on the government package but said that the package is `too late for many'. The Greens' view is that, unless the package addresses the long-term impact of climate change and ecologically unsound agricultural practices, it will be too late even for those who have immediate benefit or who are left in our agricultural sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join others in this chamber, and certainly people in the community, in expressing concern about the drought that has gripped Australia. I acknowledge the contributions to this debate by my National Party colleagues Senator Brownhill and Senator Boswell. Senator Boswell has been the leader in raising the plight of stricken farmers, particularly those in Queensland. All Queensland farmers know that he is the politician that they can turn to in their desperation. He has been vigorous on these matters, both in this chamber and in the community, and also he has raised the media profile on this issue which has brought the matter to the attention of the government. He has brought home to this parliament that we have a national disaster on our hands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anybody who knows Senator Brownhill will be aware that he is not a man of fluctuating emotions, but on this issue he has a hair-trigger in relation to the plight of the farmers and towards anyone who underplays the plight of New South Wales farmers. He spoke from the heart today, as he has done on so many other occasions, on the drought. What he and Senator Boswell said encapsulates the emotions throughout Australia. Not just in the parliament or among politicians, who often come in too late on these matters, but across Australia and the community a great deal of emotion is now being expressed for the stricken farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My state of Victoria has had its driest winter since the 1982 droughts, which in themselves were savage. This spring is not promising for farmers. Victoria's north-west, the mallee area, is bone dry, and crops across Victoria have failed. The weather bureau fears that the drought that has gripped eastern Australia will continue south into Victoria. We already know that 83 per cent of New South Wales is drought declared and over one-third of Queensland is in that category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought has taken on the largeness of a national disaster. It now has the almighty reputation of being the worst drought ever. In our sunburnt country of sweeping plains that truly is a mighty claim, especially when we think back to the times of heartbreak faced by our pioneering ancestors. Those were times when much of our culture was shaped, and when our traditional bush songs, poetry and stories emerged. Yet today things are worse than in those earlier times. It is the same harsh realities faced by past and present Australians that have allowed the never-say-die quality to be passed on through the generations to this moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of late there has been a great deal of emotion generated and captured throughout the rural communities. The finest report to date has been the Channel 9 drought report by Paul Ransley. In every way that story captured the plight of the rural communities and surely would have moved every city person watching this early morning <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program from the comfort of his or her lounge room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One particular aspect that emerged from the story was the great strength displayed by the rural women. On each occasion that the farmer and his wife were interviewed, the man referred to his wife and, when he unashamedly broke down and could not continue with the interview, the wife took up the reins. I think Henry Lawson's poems <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Drover's Wife</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brighten's Sister-in-Law</EMPHASIS> still hold true today for those rural women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Equally, the stirring of our city cousins, who so often borrow from our bush ethics, has been greatly and deeply appreciated. The high profile farmhand appeal, raising millions of dollars, and so many other charities and church groups that have chipped in, have helped the rural community in trouble with that unique Australian quality, that fine spirit of mateship. Why that spirit of mateship is one of Australia's best characteristics I cannot say, but it truly is and there is evidence of it today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economic losses of the drought will not be confined to the rural and regional areas. Rather, the impact will be felt throughout the whole economy. How can it not be when this country so heavily relies upon our primary industries? Its major exports of wool, wheat, beef and horticulture total some 20 per cent of exports. The effect of the drought upon the whole economy cannot be underestimated, yet I fear it is being underestimated. The roll-on effects are only now starting to be realised by the government and the economic writers. Already the failed winter crop has wiped out over $1.5 billion from export income, and Australian consumers will soon be feeling the impact of the escalating grain prices throughout the retail outlets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government forecasts of the losses from the drought seem to be underplayed when it says that the loss will be about $2 billion, or a 0.5 per cent shave off the GDP. I think those forecasts are looking rather underestimated. The National Farmers Federation has estimated the drought will cost the farm households alone over $1 billion directly in lost income. It is obvious that this lost income will have a roll-on effect on thousands of small businesses and industries that supply the farm sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The longer this national disaster continues, the greater the likelihood that this country will slip back into a recession in 1995-96. The drought is guaranteed to have an inflationary effect upon all points of the economy, an economy that is already facing an upswing in interest rates. That is a recipe for a renewed recession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">History will show that the greatest effect of this drought and the following wave of economic downturn will be yet another exodus of the family farmer. The family farm is the most efficient and social economic unit in society, yet there has been a growing assault on its economic structure and, indeed, its social structure. Over the past decade there has been the catchcry `small is no longer beautiful.' The great deregulation and privatisation debates have gained bull-at-a-gate support from all sections of the political leadership, without too much regard for the social and economic effects upon rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the general case with small business, family farms are the dynamo of private enterprise. Family farms represent Australian ownership of our natural resources. Such private access is rapidly being denied in other sectors of the economy due to the concentration of ownership in fewer and fewer hands. The link between ownership and work is a powerful stimulus to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the blow-out in social welfare expenditure and the consequent government debt could have been avoided if such social and economic integration had been supported in metropolitan Australia before this time, especially if we are to meet the daunting economic challenges that face us post-drought. It is therefore incumbent upon the government not only to claim our breeding herds and crops as national assets worthy to be supported and preserved, but also to believe that the family farm is worth preserving and understand that farms do not always work as big organised corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever the Australian public needed evidence that governments in Canberra become isolated from the happenings of the rest of Australia, it is sorely provided by this government's reaction to the four-year-long drought. Australian farmers and rural communities were reduced to a fourth year of severe drought and accepting packages from charity organisations before this government made a worthwhile contribution to this national disaster. Even then it was probably due to the very high media profile given to the farmhand fundraising effort, which subsequently created an enormous public interest across Australia, that politicians in Canberra, who hold the power and in government can do so much, really sat up and took notice. Prior to this, any effort to bring the drought to the attention of the government and, in particular, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) were met with those immortal words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I notice the National Party running around saying I should be standing in a paddock in some drought affected area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought is around now in Australia all the time so we have said let's try and cover this as a normal recurrence of rural life.</PARA>
<PARA>As for the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), he defended the government's record by relying upon the rural adjustment scheme as the cornerstone of government drought policy, even though he was aware that access to RAS was log jammed in red tape, and so great were its inefficiencies that it was subject at that very time he was defending it to a major Senate inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To rub salt into the wounds, the latest settlement in the waterfront strike must have confirmed where this government's ultimate loyalties lie. The absurd waterfront strike in defence of the bankrupt ANL shipping line cost the nation $55 million, yet it created a sense of urgency for settlement in Canberra, an urgency never given to the four-year-long drought which ravages parts of this country. While it has been only in the last month or so that the federal government has given the drought recognition, it took only 24 hours for the federal government to concede a remarkable tax-free concession to maritime workers. Australia's economy stands to lose billions of dollars from the drought and yet another blow is dealt to the Australian family farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mercifully, the government will today announce a welcome drought relief package and we will have time later on to scrutinise that package. It will go some of the way towards relieving the plight of our devastated farmers and rural communities and, in turn, will support the economy in general from collapsing. However, if we are to save our farmers and the rural communities, the focus must equally be upon the banking sector. In reality, the banking sector holds more power to the survival of the farmers than the government itself. Yet, unlike the government, it has yet to be brought to proper account and has been deafening in its silence regarding bank drought policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will acknowledge the National Australia Bank as it has been a major player in the farmhand appeal. I trust this reflects a policy of understanding and leniency towards the hard-hit farming families and the rural communities. But the heat must go on the other banks to force a stated policy. It is not good enough for the Prime Minister, the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy or the National Farmers Federation simply to appeal to the reasonableness of the banks. The banking sector is very well versed in offering measured public relations responses to such appeals, and these appeals will carry little weight with recession hardened financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stronger action is required. Farmers and small business need post-drought hope to fight present adversity. Hopelessness will set in with those fighting the drought if bank foreclosures haunt post-drought recovery. The banks' reputation in rural Australia is not good. What cut deepest during the recession of rural Australia was turning on the 6 o'clock news to the scene of a farmer and his family being dragged off their land following a dawn raid by sheriffs and banking officers. The tales of the banks' carpetbaggers have become as firm in legend in rural Australia as they were in the Deep South following the American Civil War carpetbaggers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even the National Farmers Federation has warned against the honesty of the banks by suggesting that they would prey upon the charity money raised for the farmers. If that sounds like an exaggeration, I refer the Senate to the comments of the National Farmers Federation in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 14 September 1994. The government has the authority to force a policy statement from the Australian Bankers Association and to monitor the tenets of that policy through the parliamentary banking, finance and public administration committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, this time the bush is fighting for its life. It has faced over the past 11 years the crippling effect of high and sustained interest rates; a ruthless bank sector; uncaring and callous governments; depressed commodity prices; unmerciful and corrupt trading partners; and now the final blow&mdash;mother nature herself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is doubtful that any other country in the world, particularly any country that relied so much on its primary industry, would abandon its rural sector to abject poverty as this country has done. This should not be taken as the usual rural or bush cry. Unless this government and the Australian community wish to see forever a fundamental change in our rural landscape, every effort without exception must be made to sustain our farming community through these hard times. If not, we face a barren land beyond the metropolitan and coastal regions. The government's regional policy will amount to nil, and Australia as a nation would have thrown away its heritage and its wealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been listening to only part of what has been said this morning, as I was involved in another meeting. What has been said so far this morning about the drought, from what I can ascertain, has pertained to the eastern states&mdash;that is, Queensland, New South Wales and, I believe, part of Victoria&mdash;and, I suppose, rightly so. But that does not mean that my state of Western Australia is totally free of drought.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did a round of what I thought may be the drought areas about three weeks ago, and since that time there has been no great amount of rainfall. There is a place in the south-east of Western Australia&mdash;incidentally, it includes the area in which Senator Winston Crane farms and stretches from Gnowangerup in the west to Condingup in the east, and from Salmon Gums in the north to Esperance in the south, a diamond shaped area&mdash;that has been badly affected by drought this year. The rainfall for Esperance, for instance, is 60 per cent below its lowest ever recording. Esperance is a town which normally receives 27 inches of rainfall, so it is normally regarded as a rather safe area. So it is a totally disastrous situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought has caused crop losses in quite a few cases. In most cases, in Esperance it rained so late that there was very little crop sown, which is probably an advantage because at least the inputs did not go in. Stock were removed very early in the piece&mdash;fortunately, while prices were still all right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought has caused other problems as well. It has caused a shortage of water on farms. The Jerramungup shire&mdash;and there is another town, the name of which I cannot think of at the moment, but I will come to it later&mdash;has had to start carting water to its own town and to towns such as Ongerup. When I was visiting that town there was only about 10 to 12 days supply of water in the town dams. They would have had to start carting water initially from about 100 kilometres away, but that dam would have lasted only about a week, and then from 250 kilometres, either coming from Lake Grace or from Esperance at the other end. Esperance, of course, is reasonably short of water itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether anyone spoke from your side, Mr Deputy President&mdash;and you are a Western Australian senator&mdash;but what I am telling you is that Western Australia is not totally devoid of drought, but fortunately is not in the same situation as the eastern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that three-quarters of the wheat belt of Western Australia is affected and would have had below average rainfall. We can expect below average seasons, but I put on record that Western Australia is not having the season that a few people may think. With three-quarters of the wheat belt in the state affected, I believe that even Western Australia's wheat production will be down quite a bit this year compared to the average, let alone last year's figure. I will put on record also that, although a quarter of the wheat belt&mdash;that part towards the west coast&mdash;is having quite a good season, it will not make up for the three-quarters of the state that is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government's package this afternoon, especially for the eastern states, has to be a good one. I believe that the Fraser government, in the final analysis, allocated some $360 million for the 1982 drought. This government so far, to my knowledge, has committed only $14 million, and I believe that what will be announced this afternoon will take that up to $100 million, which is far short of that $360 million that was allocated by the Fraser government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not know when this drought is going to break. That is the big question. Taking the experience of 1982, it broke towards the end of March in the eastern states. But it does not mean that, when the drought breaks, the income starts coming in. It is generally when the next crop is planted, some seven or eight months later. So this government would have to be well ready to provide assistance up to the figure provided by the Fraser government in 1982. The Fraser government, having supplied that assistance, saw the benefit down the track. Farmers were still on their farms when the good years came and the people were able to remain in the country, not necessarily on the farms but in allied service industries, and receive the benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government does a good job of this package this afternoon, then it can look forward to the benefits of it when the seasons turn around. The seasons will turn around. A good season generally follows a drought, or at least a better season. That is a self-evident fact. But if the government does the right thing and provides a good package, then it will get the benefit in time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I also compare the figure that has been allocated for drought to date with the amount given to ANL the other day&mdash;$50 million was not too hard to find. I hope the government is just as generous with the very hard situation caused by the drought in the eastern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make a special appeal to the government on behalf of young people from the country who are doing university courses or other courses&mdash;that the assistance to be given in the package will assist them to at least finish their courses. </PARA>

I certainly support the previous speakers on the coalition side in their approach to this motion moved by the Western Australian Greens.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been many speeches so far on the effects of the drought on our nation. It is important to recognise that the whole of regional Australia is in that situation. It will suffer increasingly from the effects of the drought&mdash;not only the farmers, who are the hardest and most directly hit, but all those other people in rural and regional communities who rely on the incomes that farmers generate in the good times. Any package from the government, of necessity, must include consideration for small businessmen in rural and regional areas and for workers and others thrown out of their jobs because of the effects of the drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many instances, farmers and small businessmen are simply no longer able to continue the employment of their employees, many of whom have worked with particular farmers or  small businessmen all of their lives. They suffer the emotional tragedy of having to say to those people who have worked loyally in their business&mdash;a farm business or a town business&mdash;all of their lives, `Sorry, we just can't continue your employment.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The effects of the drought are so widespread in regional communities. Some of my colleagues have mentioned the very real fear that whole towns and communities in regional Australia will simply have to shut down because once the farm income stops, the small businessmen cannot continue to operate; once the small businessmen are not there, their employees do not have jobs; and once farmers and small businessmen are not paying rates, councils find it very difficult to continue. Even though councils try to mop up some of the unemployed in rural and regional towns, their resources are very limited and they are not able to continue to do that. It is a real tragedy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues, very appropriately, have mentioned the enormous effect on farmers and farm families. I simply wish to emphasise that the effects of the drought are more widespread&mdash;there are effects on small businesses in rural communities and towns, on workers and councils. In fact everyone has a very difficult time in an extreme drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a Queensland senator, I have travelled in a lot of drought areas. The Liberal Party is very concerned. I know that Mr Taylor, the member for Groom, whose electorate is one of the worst hit, has a real concern for the ongoing viability and livelihood of many of the communities in the Darling Downs area. As I travel around Western Queensland, particularly in the Rockhampton area, I can see that the effects of the drought are horrific, not only in an economic sense but also in a personal and emotional way. </PARA>

I will perhaps elaborate further on that point when the matter is discussed upon the announcement of the government's package for drought relief.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important to get things a little in perspective. There has been quite a lot of discussion from the Greens and the Australian Democrats about the need to adjust such industries to the changing situation in the world, the need to have the economic smarts to realise the changes that are necessary and the need to realise also that industries that may be big in some senses may not be bringing Australia a great many benefits at the same time as they are imposing a great many environmental costs now and for the future. The reality is that Australia is being played as a pawn in a game by coal multinationals. Most of those companies are owned and controlled overseas. Very little of their profits are going into Australia. In terms of employment, it is not a big industry&mdash;and it is one we can afford to restructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not see people jumping up and down about the many more thousands of people who are losing their jobs as a result of such things as tariff reductions through GATT or the lead-up to GATT in industries such as the footwear, clothing and textile industries. I think that for credibility we would have to see equal concern for the many more people losing their jobs in other industries than are currently likely to have their jobs at risk in an industry like coal which does need readjustment for us to be able to meet our future commitments. We have also had quite a lot of discussion on the nature of proof. What proof do we have and what proof do we not have? What has come out a lot in this discussion is that there seems to be a lack of understanding about the nature of proof in the field of climatology. It is acknowledged in climatology that there is never any total proof. It is not like something we can put in a test tube and say, `Yes, that has happened on a certain number of occasions; therefore we can comfortably predict that it will happen given certain conditions.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the problem that if we wait until we have absolute proof, it may well be too late. Very recently from the CSIRO we received information that the kinds of changes we are talking about involve a change of two to four per cent over a hundred years, when the world would normally be expected to move towards an ice age over a minimum of 10,000 to 15,000 years&mdash;perhaps up to 100,000 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill talked about little dry periods. We are talking about some massive changes and the possibility of a very significant change that, as I said before, could be up to 15 per cent in areas with the most ice in the world. That would mean we would have massive increases in sea levels. That has not really come up in today's debate. We should think of the impact of those kinds of changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about statements that are coming from a scattered number of scientists. The outcome of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been mentioned on a number of occasions today. I would like to mention a couple of points from its statements. Its statement of 5 September is entitled `While Sceptics and Alarmists Square Off, the IPCC Forges Consensus'. This is the acknowledgment:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Geneva, September 1994&mdash;The climate change debate as it takes place through the media and other public fora is not always based on sound science.</PARA>
<PARA>The statement talks about the possibility for alarmists and sceptics, and it is very right to do so. But it also mentions:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IPCC is an intergovernmental scientific and technical body consisting of a very small secretariat and a world wide network of 2,500 scientists and experts who are leaders in their fields.</PARA>
<PARA>We are not talking about a handful of people. To get this kind of consensus in this kind of scientific discussion is phenomenal. The statement also mentions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because carbon dioxide&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA>This is not alarmist stuff, as I said. It is trying to get into contact with reality. We have also had a number of other statements today. Senator Brownhill mentioned, and he was right, that people are suffering now. But he also said that we cannot worry about what will happen 30 years down the track.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. Senator Coulter mentioned that a great deal of greenhouse gas is produced by intercountry air travel. It is true that any change in policies which means we have the ability to use less sea travel certainly will impact on the level of global greenhouse gases. Although some may be thinking of using aircraft for freight instead of using shipping, which is much better in terms of greenhouse gas production, in reality we may not even need to worry about this in the long-term because, according to global predictions, in 20 years time we will have basically run out of aviation gas. We seem to be forgetting that, too. Petroleum as a resource also has a finite period. So there are many reasons why we have to change the way we do business. We do not have to stop producing for our needs. What we emphasise and what the Democrats are emphasising today is that we need to do things smarter and differently in order to meet our needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to highlight that the whole drought question has wider physical implications than just those for agriculture. Scientists are currently working, especially in the Americas, on the consequences in terms of biological diversity; and that has been mentioned a few times today. With such a rapid change of climate, many species will become unsuited to their habitat. Plants cannot walk away and find better habitats, and natural movement is slow&mdash;far slower than climate change. As a consequence, a lot of plants may become extinct and there may be serious implications for forests, wetlands and other biomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In North America, it is thought, whole forests may simply die. Animals can walk, but there are real problems for animals that need a certain habitat. There are problems where animals exist in parks and biological islands with no corridors to possible new habitats. Many animal species may also be endangered. This would have all sorts of implications, including economic ones, especially for forestry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say strongly that all of this&mdash;the emergency relief and the adjustment programs&mdash;is a consequence of human created climate change, or it would be seem that it is in line with what we are expecting from that. There are proposals to do something to stop such change. The government has shown little commitment to do anything about slowing or stopping the effects of greenhouse by addressing sources. It has not taken any conservative measures; it is talking about going and claiming economic disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Part of the problem is that in reports on greenhouse such as the CRA report, the Industry Commission report and the ecologically sustainable development report there was never any value placed on the damage the greenhouse effect might cause. It was said that this was not quantifiable and, therefore, no value could be assigned&mdash;where there are no costs assigned to climate change, there are no benefits from stopping such change. This has been a fundamental distortion in the Australian calculations of the costs and benefits of greenhouse gas reduction, although even things that clearly had no cost implications anyway we could have examined; and they were not implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to note that we can at least begin to calculate a cost. So far this year the cost is likely to be about $3 billion, not including the cost of relief, the cost of fires resulting from drought conditions, the cost of possible loss of forests and other biological resources, the cost of land degradation due to farming under poor conditions, and the cost of adjustment and relief. All up, this year it may cost something closer to $5 billion or $6 billion. People should put that in their calculations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will argue that we are small producers on a global scale. True, but we are major producers of greenhouse gas on a per capita basis. We are somewhere in the top four. Two of the top five global producers of greenhouse emissions are our neighbours India and China. They use a small fraction per capita of the energy we do, and most of their emissions come from animals and swamps. If we want them to take any action, how can we think of going back to the convention and asking for an exemption because we think it would cost us something? People will laugh in our face; and if they do not take greenhouse seriously, we are well and truly down the tubes economically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a matter of urgency and rational action, we must do something for farmers if we want to have an agricultural industry left in 30 years time. We will need to do this regardless, because we have already been changing our climate. We do not want this problem to get worse and worse until we pass the stage where we have the ability to cope. We need to do something about stopping emissions globally. We need to get serious and do it soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just put in our national communication as required under the convention. It shows that we have done little and will not meet our targets. I say it is time for the government to come to terms with this issue and it must do so by February next year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to ensure that Australia's onshore refugee determination system is not open to the abuse of forum shopping by asylum seekers who have been denied refugee status by or who have access to protection in another country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will ensure that non-citizens covered by the Comprehensive Plan of Action for Indo-chinese refugees (CPA) or in relation to whom there is a safe third country, should not be able to apply for a protection visa and, in some cases, any other visa. An immediate example is that of people for whom there is a safe third country who have been assessed by a refugee determination process which is accepted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Under this bill such people will not be entitled to opt for another assessment under Australian processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments to the Migration Act are being introduced following the arrival in Australia of 17 Vietnamese people on a boat codenamed "Vagabond" from a refugee holding centre in Galang, Indonesia. These people, who had been rejected as refugees in Indonesia by a refugee determination process approved by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, sought to have another assessment of their cases conducted by Australia. They have, in effect, forum-shopped in the expectation of obtaining the outcome they were seeking through the refugee determination process in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current domestic law there is no option but to allow such arrivals access to Australia's refugee determination process, which we operate as a party to the 1951 UN Convention and the 1967 Protocol relating to the status of refugees. Consequently, this access was granted, despite requests from the UNHCR and the Indonesian Government not to process the applicants but to return them immediately to Galang. The UNHCR undertook to examine any fresh claims or evidence put forward by the Vagabond arrivals following their return to Indonesia. If the legislation introduced today had existed at the time that the Vagabond landed we would have been able to comply with these requests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the event, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, after examining all claims, decided not to grant refugee status to 14 of the 17 Vagabond arrivals. Three were found to be refugees on the basis of new information. Had this information been available to the UNHCR the further refugee claims of these three people would have been examined by them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the prejudice to our international relations that would have arisen from any change in the decisions refusing the 14 Vagabond applicants refugee status, the Minister issued conclusive certificates denying them access to the Refugee Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth reviewing the history of this issue in the region, which provides context for the bill. Until 1989, the international response to the problem of Indo-Chinese asylum seekers had been a combination of temporary asylum in countries in the region, and international resettlement. Increasingly, the reasons given by those fleeing related to poverty, rather than persecution. In 1989, the UNHCR-sponsored CPA, in which Australia has been a major participant, constituted a new framework to safeguard the protection of refugees. Under the CPA, those screened in as refugees are offered third country resettlement. Those screened out are required to return to Vietnam under arrangements monitored by the UNHCR. The CPA also provides a framework for orderly migration from Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A crucial part of the CPA has been the establishment of refugee status determination procedures in countries of first asylum such as Indonesia. These processes are conducted in association with the UNHCR and according to the UN Convention definition of "refugee". They include both primary and secondary levels of assessment. The 17 Vietnamese boat people who arrived in Broome on 7 July, 1994 had been assessed under these UNHCR sponsored processes in Indonesia and had been found not to be refugees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From July 1989 to July 1994, Australia has resettled 17,600 Vietnamese and Laotian refugees under the CPA, with about 1,400 expected to arrive during 1994-95. Our effort has been, and continues to be exemplary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A continuation of the present Australian law, where anyone who can get into a boat in Galang or other camps in South East Asia and sail to Australia is entitled to another assessment of their refugee status would severely undermine the whole CPA process and weaken the credibility of all such comprehensive international approaches. If there is to be no difference in the way genuine refugees and those assessed to be economic migrants are treated, protection for those in real need will be seriously weakened, and the genuine refugee pushed aside by the forum shopper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In July, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs stated the Government's firm intention to act urgently when Parliament resumed to ensure that Australia's policies and refugee procedures are brought into line with UNHCR's concerns. This bill puts this resolve into effect. The seriousness of the potential undermining of the CPA is highlighted by the arrival in Australia of a second boat of Vietnamese people from Galang on 9 September and the recent interception of a third boat by Indonesian authorities which was heading from Galang to Australia. As foreshadowed by the Minister on 29 August, the bill will cover the period from 1 September onwards, and so, in effect will deny the second, and any subsequent boats, the chance to contribute further to the breakdown of the CPA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While initiated because of events relating to the CPA, the bill also enables Australia to identify safe third countries which will allow for the return to those countries of any asylum seekers who could have availed themselves or did avail themselves of an equitable refugee assessment process or protection in those countries, or for whom effective protection is available in those countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with our obligations under international law, countries with whom we enter into safe third country agreements would need to observe the principle of non-refoulement of refugees and internationally accepted minimum standards of human rights. The bill requires the Minister to make a statement to the Parliament after a particular safe country is prescribed by the regulations, about the country's compliance with relevant international law concerning the protection of persons seeking asylum and relevant human rights standards. Furthermore the formal mechanism for designating Safe Third Countries by way of Regulations will afford the Parliament the opportunity to scrutinise that designation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Persons who have the necessary connection with a safe third country will not be permitted to apply for a protection visa in Australia. Further, those persons who have not been immigration cleared will not be permitted to apply for any other form of visa: they will be detained and removed from Australia. To ensure there are not harsh or unintended results the bill contains two key safeguards. The first is to exempt coverage of persons by the legislation through the making of a regulation, for example where conditions in the country of origin have changed to the extent that temporary asylum in Australia is the most appropriate form of response to their situation. And secondly in relation to individuals, the bill provides a non-compellable power for the Minister to set aside the operation of the safe third country provisions to allow an application to be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill requires the mandatory removal of people covered by the amendment who have not been immigration cleared, and of people who, having been immigration cleared, are in detention and have not made a valid application for any other visa that can be granted in the migration zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is a staunch supporter of UNHCR's massive efforts throughout the world to assist genuine refugees, and the imaginative and enlightened adoption by countries in our region of the comprehensive solution of the CPA. It is because of this that the Government regards this legislation as a crucial defence of proper, equitable and humane processes. To do less undermines the CPA in what is its most difficult period, following the screening of all in the camps and the requirement to return those found not to be refugees, which now constitutes almost all of the population of the camps. Not to make the changes would also undermine the integrity of, and public support for, Australia's own refugee determination system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In an era when on-shore refugee determination systems in most asylum countries are being modified to refocus attention on convention refugees and to limit the impact of irregular migration upon the ability to offer protection to those who genuinely need it, Australia can not afford to be left behind. It is essential that our determination system keep pace with developments in other asylum countries and continue to enable Australia to honour its international obligations to refugees.</PARA>

Secondly, the government traditionally does not support formal motions that relate to the formation of Senate select committees.

<PARA>I want to say at the outset that I, the Greens (WA) and the Greens in general are strong supporters of the ABC. We very much value the institution of a national public broadcaster and we see this reference as in no way an attack on the ABC or on the institution of a national public broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there has been a growing number of instances over the past year where concern has been expressed about, firstly, the way in which the ABC has been managed; secondly, whether some of its activities exceed its charter&mdash;and I refer to the ATV Asian and regional focus rather than the national focus as one example; and, thirdly, how management reaches its decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I were asked about the many subclauses in this motion relating to this reference, then I would like to say that none of paragraphs (a) to (f) is intended, in our view, to be singled out. We do not want to overemphasise any particular area. We are just listing the numerous concerns that have been gradually mounting regarding the ABC. The first concern is about Australian Television International, its penetration of target markets in Asia and the usage of its funding that may well be disadvantaging the maintenance of quality national broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been grave concern in the community&mdash;particularly in Western Australia and the other regional areas&mdash;regarding the proposal to abolish regional TV news programs and the increasing centralisation of the process on a national basis. The most recent indicator was the evidence that ABC program sponsorship rules may have been significantly and deliberately breached in a number of ABC co-productions that have gone to air. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the inclusion of this matter in a rationale for an inquiry does not pre-empt the Palmer inquiry, but is complementary to it. If this committee is set up and has to report back on 1 March 1995, there is no difficulty in delaying hearings in relation to that particular matter referred to in section (1)(c) of my motion. Those hearings could be deferred until the completion of the Palmer inquiry. We could draw any valuable reflections and results from that inquiry into the final consideration of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a continuing high level of resignations and departures by senior experienced broadcasting managers and program makers from the ABC. Whilst I would not want any particular facet to be overemphasised, that matter has contributed substantially to the Greens' concern which has brought us to this point. The chamber may well remember that in June I proposed a select committee on possible political influence in personnel matters in the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. I took that action as a result of being contacted by the Queensland Greens, who were concerned that there was a need for a serious investigation of some matters occurring in that state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that my involvement in the whistleblowers committee also assisted me in that regard. When we had committee hearings in Queensland it was quite apparent that there were serious problems in relation to allegations, at the very least, regarding the media and the state government. It is in the public interest that those concerns be raised under the auspices of a parliamentary committee. I believe that any serious allegations of political influence in our national public broadcaster deserve careful examination. They are as important as any other matters that have been raised in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were concerns that dismissals and resignations of journalists and program management staff in Queensland may have been as a result of government or other pressure, or have been caused by staff discontent with perceptions of such pressure. It is vital for freedom of expression in Australia that the national broadcaster not only be free of such pressures and allegations, but is seen to be free of them. Evidence of such pressures and influences is notoriously difficult to uncover without access to information and without the power of an independent and formal inquiry. For that reason, I believe that those who have expressed concern but who may have been in fear of the consequences of their speaking out will have one of the most beneficial aspects of the Senate process&mdash;a Senate committee&mdash;to assist them. They will be able to appear in-confidence or on the public record with information that may be of vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Controversies have been raised surrounding appointments to the ABC board. There have been concerns that individual merit and potential contribution to the policy direction, public standing and political independence of the ABC were no longer the sole criteria for appointments. That concern deserves to be addressed. There is increasing and continuing public concern about the nature and extent of the ABC's involvement in commercial activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst any one of these concerns may have merited an inquiry in its own right, each of them could have been accused of being some sort of witch-hunt. However, I believe that we are doing it in a constructive and positive way by adopting this method. We are not overemphasising any of these matters. We are not engaged in a trawling exercise, as the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) implied in her comments. We see it as a positive step to clear the air regarding the ABC&mdash;and the air waves, I might add&mdash;and to ensure that the great institution of the ABC will continue into the next century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I continue my series of speeches on the advent in Australia of the information superhighway. I have spoken in a number of other matters of public interest speeches about my recent trip to the United States and the information superhighway coming, ready or not. The metaphor is that the information superhighway is a complex web of network communications connections. We have developing in America&mdash;and, indeed, starting to develop in Australia&mdash;an optic fibre superhighway which is coming to link telephone, television and computers, and to provide a whole range of broadband services. The implication for Australian industry, and in particular for Australian society, is massive. The advent of this superhighway will impact upon the home, education, the workplace and health care delivery.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today I want to focus on the implications for this parliament and this federal government, and on the regulatory regime that is needed to focus and shape the development of this new information age. Around the world, governments are acting to do this, but unfortunately this government is very slow to act on this matter. It has a major inquiry going on at this time, and that is fine; but in my experience overseas I saw many examples of governments, particularly those of different states in the United States, not just having inquiries but acting and putting plans into place, and having systems developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of North Carolina, as they build up their public infrastructure network, by the year 2000 every home will be within one hour's drive of one of these major nodes of the information superhighway. In Japan there is the Japanese Telecommunications Council, which in a recent report to the government entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Reforms towards the intellectually creative society of 21st century</EMPHASIS> recommended:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the regulatory regime will need reform to accommodate the convergence of telecommunications and broadcasting.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Japanese are heading well down the track. The government needs to respond very quickly in Australia, because the technology and the services are evolving so rapidly. We have some businesses taking advantage of this information superhighway already, but if the government does not get its regulatory framework right there are problems and dangers with the way this is developing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have mega-corporations emerging to take advantage of this new era. We have the Packer-Murdoch-Optus-Continental Cable consortium&mdash;PMOC, as it is called. As these companies converge, and as the technologies converge, they will create enormous economic power in the hands of a few. On the other side of this duopoly is Telecom, which is also linking in with a number of companies. These companies have had a little bit of a hiccup with some of their developments, but I am sure they will get back on track again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have evolving in this country&mdash;unfortunately, like many other industries&mdash;is a massive duopoly that not only controls the means of communication but also has enormous control over the products that travel on that communications network. With the concerns with monopoly power and duopoly power that we have always had in this country, a new era is developing, and the government is just sitting on its hands and letting it develop. It does not have a regulatory framework for this and, indeed, it does not really have a policy to counter this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To show honourable senators where we are going as these mega-corporations develop, I quote from the corporation president of US Bell Atlantic, James Cullen. He was involved in putting together one of these mega-corporations initially. It involved Bell Atlantic and it involved some of the big databases, particularly the communications companies and the movie studios. That particular one was set up and then fell apart, but a whole range of others have developed since. He had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . within five years telecommunication industry distinctions will blur and we'll just have a series of companies using a variety of technologies.</PARA>
<PARA>When I was in America, I discovered that Washington is trying to struggle with the issues that have been raised and that it is trying to move along as quickly as possible a suitable regulatory framework for this. The leader in this issue is Al Gore, the US Vice-President. He has been talking about it for 10 years. He quite frequently appears on national television to talk about his plan for the information superhighway. He has put out a challenge to US industry to connect all of the public institutions in America&mdash;all schools, universities, major business houses and perhaps government departments&mdash;by the year 2000. Given that it is variable across the states, some of the states have taken up this challenge with a vengeance. In fact, North Carolina plans to do that by the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The piece of legislation that the US government is working with is the communications act of&mdash;wait for it&mdash;1934. That act is a little behind the current state of technology but that is the act that is in place. Members of both the US Senate and the Congress are working hard to bring together an act that will basically deregulate the industry and allow companies to carry the services and also provide services. The US is coming up with a framework and it is really getting into things in this area. However, the Australian government is being very slow on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that the government has to look at, apart from the companies that are going to provide a lot of the services, is what is happening in the layout of the information superhighway. There are 1.8 million kilometres of optic fibre cable both in and between Sydney and Melbourne, and that is growing. Telstra will be putting broadband fibre optic and coaxial cable past 1.1 million houses by 1996. Optus and Continental Cablevision are rolling out their network to reach two million homes within four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their network is being rolled out in some very imaginative ways: rather than digging trenches in the ground, in some parts of Sydney their cable will run along the electricity network. This cable can be run along with electricity wires&mdash;there are no rights of way, poles do not have to be built or anything like that. The network that is there is what is used. The Americans are also doing this. It is certainly a very imaginative way of rolling out this information superhighway at a very rapid rate. Not only will this network link Australia, and link businesses in Australia, but it will also very effectively link us to the rest of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Internet system, which is a series of databases&mdash;30,000, in fact&mdash;has been increasingly linking up across America and the rest of the world. That system is growing at a rate of eight per cent annually. In Australia we are well placed with the Aarnet system, which goes across the universities and research institutes. There are a whole lot of groups linking up to our version of the Internet system. The traffic in Australia is growing rapidly. We are now the fourth largest users of Internet worldwide. So the capacity and the usage is starting to develop here, but what is not developing here is this government's policies to properly regulate and develop this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Early in 1994 there were signs of a whole range of new developments that could increase access to the information superhighway and the products on it. New software being released will enable teleconferencing and videoconferencing from ordinary desktop PC workstations. Once this is widely known, it will be rapidly taken up. Public debate in this country is lagging on the issues that I have raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing that struck me when I was in America was that when I turned on the TV or the radio I frequently heard people debating these issues. Issues such as how this new information age was going to change the total industrial structure of the country over the next 50 years, what the government should be doing and how businesses could take better advantage of what was developing were discussed. I find very little evidence of that sort of discussion occurring in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hear in the academic bodies some debate; we hear in the government some debate; but out there, in the broader public consciousness, this issue is not being debated. There are huge ramifications for every individual in Australia because this will affect the whole way their lives develop&mdash;in terms of entertainment, in terms of work and in terms of the way they live. The government's main think-tank on it is the Broadband Services Expert Group and that group is developing the main policy response to the government at this time. So in this bit of a limbo land, other countries have theirs up and running; we are still thinking about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The group was set up on 8 December 1993 and has to report at the end of this year. It is chaired by the Australian Broadcasting Authority Chair, Brian Johns. The interim report was released in July and it does lay down some fundamental conditions for regulatory action and legislation by the parliament. So there is a start. Page 19 of the interim report says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Broadband Services Expert Group believes the benefits of a broadband network will be maximised if non discriminatory access is available to all service provider companies.</PARA>
<PARA>With what I have just said about the development of duopolies and mega-corporations, it is absolutely crucial in the government's policy that it allows smaller companies easier access onto this information superhighway. What we do not want is two mega-companies controlling access onto the information superhighway, having a lot of the products and then cutting out other groups. It must be open access and that is one of the major principles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But where is the government's policy on this? The Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, seems to be sitting on his hands and he is not tackling the really big issues that the development of the information superhighway throws up. If he does not do this quickly, Australians will be the losers. We could lose services potentially worth billions of dollars because, although the information superhighway opens up the opportunity for a whole range of new products, they may not be necessarily Australian products. They could be overseas products in a big way. If we do not get our own products, if the overseas products come on, the people overseas are going to be making the money, not Australians. That will have massive implications for our overseas debt as we import more down the information superhighway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The way in which the government is actually reacting on this was best summed up by Barry Jones in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sleepers, Wake!</EMPHASIS> in 1983. The sleepers are still fast asleep on this issue despite the efforts of Barry Jones. On the ABC, on 12 July this year, he summed up the way the government reacted when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We tend to react to things; we tend to stumble into things . . . we say: Oh really, we ought to have a policy response to that. But we don't anticipate the changes, we react to them.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what is happening in this area at the moment. Our media and telecommunications laws need urgent reform. A single industry law for TV, radio, computers and telephones is urgently needed. We have the development of these consortiums that I mentioned earlier, making the industrial structure of Australia even more concentrated. Not only economic power is being concentrated; political power is also being concentrated. Overseas governments have shown they are concerned with this problem and they are prepared to act. We call, for the sake of Australian industry and the future of this communications industry, for the government to act now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I rise to pay tribute to Libby Slater who died on 2 September at the young age of 37. The announcement of her untimely death from pneumonia, following a flu virus, came as a profound shock to everyone who knew her. Libby Slater was a greatly respected lawyer, teacher and author, not only in Australia but also in the international realm of law. Without a doubt, she was one of Australia's leading superannuation experts. Libby was also a leading expert in tax law. I believe that her enormous professional achievements, in such a short lifetime, must be admired, respected and acknowledged by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She was a partner with the law firm Mallesons Stephen Jaques in Sydney where she had worked since 1983. She wrote numerous authoritative articles and was a member of the editorial board of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Butterworth's Superannuation Bulletin</EMPHASIS>. As an author, Libby Slater wrote a definitive and landmark text on surplus problems for superannuation funds. This text has been extensively used since its publication as an authority on the issues of surplus. In fact, the book raised for the first time issues relating to surplus distribution when adventurous things were being done with surpluses in relation to superannuation without regard to the legal issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate representing the Attorney-General. I refer to the scathing remarks by Perth District Court Judge Nigel Clark that there was a `strong whiff of corruption' around the conduct of former deputy premier David Parker's acceptance of certain large donations. He went on to say that Parker's thefts took place `when the elders of the ALP espoused the precept that electoral victory was an end to justify the means' and that `the rank and file who devote themselves selflessly to fundraising will be discouraged if the guardians of the monies raised plunder them'. In light of the statement by the Minister for Administrative Services, Frank Walker, yesterday that a payment to a politician which is unrelated to an election is not something that should be included in an electoral return, is not this contemptuous, arrogant government really thumbing its nose at an electoral reform designed to stop this type of fraud?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will ignore the political static associated with that particular question and the feigned indignation and synthetic anger that is so characteristic of this otherwise very wimpish character opposite and deal simply with the substantive points in issue. I am advised that the Commonwealth Electoral Act does make a distinction between gifts made to a candidate in a private capacity for personal use and gifts made to a candidate for purposes related to a Commonwealth election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gifts made to a candidate in a private capacity must be disclosed if used solely or substantially for a political purpose. Gifts below certain thresholds need not be disclosed in any circumstances. The act was amended in 1992, as honourable senators will recall, to require third parties to disclose gifts made to candidates or parties. Where a gift is disclosed by a third party, failure by a candidate or his party to acknowledge or account for that gift will automatically lead to the Australian Electoral Commission investigating the matter.</PARA>

Is the minister aware of an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> detailing the impact of growth in manufacturing exports upon the restoration of full employment in Australia? This report is based upon a study undertaken by the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies entitled, `The rebirth of Australian industry'. Is the minister aware that this research study suggests that manufacturing export growth rates could be sustained at five per cent per annum which would have a substantial impact on job growth? What action will the government take to ensure that growth rates for the manufacturing export sector are increased?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1076" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SMALL BUSINESS, CUSTOMS AND CONSTRUCTION" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Carr for his question, and certainly note that he has had a long-term interest in industry development in Australia. The report that he refers to was officially released today here in Canberra. The government is very pleased with the outcome of this report which, as Senator Carr said, is entitled, `The rebirth of Australian industry' by the Victorian-based Centre for Strategic Economic Studies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report, which I commend to all senators, tells a very good news story for Australian manufacturing. The research focuses on our performance in producing and exporting elaborately transformed manufactures, the so-called ETMs. ETMs include products like motor vehicles, ships, pharmaceuticals, sophisticated machinery and computer and communications equipment. Since 1985 growth in Australian exports of ETMs has averaged 14.5 per cent per annum after the previous decade or more showed almost no growth at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent statistics from the ABS show that in the past few years growth has been closer to 20 per cent than to 14 per cent. This compares with the average annual growth rate of less than two per cent in the first half of the 1980s. But, more importantly, the story is also good news when we compare ourselves with the performance of our competitors. While there has been an acceleration of growth in world exports of ETMs, Australian exports of ETMs have grown faster; that is, the pie is getting bigger and we are gaining a bigger share of the bigger pie.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These outcomes did not happen by accident. The report recognises the success of this government's industry policies. Again I commend the report, particularly to senators opposite, so they may see how the government's policies over the past decade have contributed to the growth of ETMs. I want to say that we are now building on that, and particularly on the policies announced in the Working Nation statement of May this year which provided a number of initiatives that encourage innovation and management; provided incentives to increase the uptake of technology; ensured that firms, particularly small- and medium-sized firms, have access to finance to underpin their growth; and stimulate strategic partnerships with industry through enterprise networking. While these are specific policies in the industry statement Working Nation, we will certainly aim, through the trade policies that Senator McMullan is in charge of, to ensure that we continue to look at increasing opportunities opening up for Australian industry in overseas markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The author of the report suggests that the continued improvement in ETM exports could accelerate the fall of unemployment in Australia before the year 2001. It will do so by boosting the growth of GDP to the order of five per cent per year through to the end of the decade. The most important quote from the report says that at the moment we have an ETM export-import ratio of 30 per cent. If that grows, as it is believed it will, to 50 per cent by the year 2001, then, to quote from the report, it `would imply a rate of growth permitted under the balance of payments constraint of 1.5 to two percentage points per annum higher than if the present ratio was maintained. This implies that Australia could achieve economic growth in the order of five per cent per annum over this period'. The achievement of a growth rate of five per cent per annum over the period until 2001 would require successful policies in the areas outlined in the Working Nation statement. This report shows that this government has got it right for the last decade in establishing ETMs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht gave a very important outline of the exports of highly added manufactures earlier in question time, and the same thing is happening in this area and in related services areas. Exports are growing very quickly and they are increasingly important sources of employment growth in the Australian economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information technology and telecommunications products are very important elements of that growth and we should be very proud of the things that are happening. There are a lot of Australians in jobs and offices all around the country in this industry working because of the success of this industry internationally. It is generating jobs in all the cities and many of the major regional centres of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may look at services more broadly and then put this in context, the recent so-called LEK study on intelligent exports and the silent revolution in services said that the increase in services exports is likely to lead to an additional 109,000 new jobs by 1998. In fact, there are some proposals in that report that suggest it might even be earlier. The information technology and telecommunications industry is leading the way. Our exports in this area have grown tenfold over the past decade, from $250 million to $2.5 billion.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems is that Australians underestimate the extent to which Australia does very well in this area. We still have an old-fashioned view of ourselves. More importantly, our markets tend to have an old-fashioned view and see us as essentially a source of commodities and tourist destinations, both of which are very important and should not be under-estimated. But this new growth area of telecommunications and information technology has exports roughly equivalent to, for example, our annual exports of sugar, dairy, wine and spirits combined. It is almost equivalent to iron ore&mdash;$2.5 billion to $2.9 billion is the ratio. It is becoming one of our major sectors of export.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has set itself a very substantial future export growth&mdash;a target of $10 billion per year of exports by the year 2000. We are working very closely with the industry to achieve this laudable goal, and I think the extent of that cooperation will be a key issue in determining whether we succeed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently I had the chance to be associated with the very appropriate decision and cooperative arrangement between the Australian Information Industry Association and Austrade, as a result of which an AIIA export manager will be based within Austrade to help the industry and to coordinate. We are also working very closely with the telecommunications export task force which brings together industry and government representatives. Obviously, the more orthodox bilateral route of governments assisting with business missions, with Australian companies going overseas and seeking to make high level contacts, is valuable because there is a big government role in this area and the countries of our region. We recently had good experience in that regard in Thailand and in China, and previously in Latin America.</PARA>

I asked the minister to reconcile two entirely conflicting environmental reports. Is it not a fact that the minister is having a factional brawl with the Queensland government; that he goes out to get an environmental report that is different from the one the Queensland Labor government has; and that he will keep going until he gets a report that suits his factional position? Is the minister also aware that the developer has said that, because of the minister's procrastination, he is going to proceed with the development on the original plans for which he already has approval, which is a far less desirable form of development than the one he is trying to get approval for now? Unless the minister stops using this issue to have a fight with the right wing of the Labor Party in Queensland, this absolute farce will simply go on and a much needed development for North Queensland, which will create hundreds of jobs and a lot of export dollars, will simply go by the board. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

The key operational commands for the contingent, including in particular command on the ground in Bougainville, will be held by Fiji and Tonga. Australia has been requested by PNG and the other participating nations and other players in the peace process to take responsibility for the planning, training and logistic support of the operation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deployment of the South Pacific peacekeeping contingent to Bougainville is provided for under the `Honiara Commitment to Peace on Bougainville' that was signed on 3 September between Sir Julius and the BRA leader, Sam Kauona. Its main task will be to secure the venue for the Bougainville peace conference to be held in Arawa in October. The contingent is proposed to be deployed for some 14 days presently anticipated to be between 3 and 17 October.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our support for the peacekeeping operation will consist of the preparatory training of the 400-strong contingent in Townsville followed by transport of it to Bougainville in early October. We will also have a role in providing support for the contingent during its stay on Bougainville, and supplying logistic and technical assistance throughout the operation, including rations, medical support and communications.

At the same time, it should be fully understood that Australia in no way assumes responsibility for the success or failure of the peace conference.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to applaud the efforts made by Sir Julius Chan in pursuing a peaceful negotiated settlement of the Bougainville conflict. I very much welcome the renunciation by rebel groups of the use of arms as contained in the cease-fire agreement on Bougainville signed on 8 September. The present peace process has undoubtedly given Bougainville its best chance of returning to normalcy in the six years since the conflict commenced. In that context, I also want to have a word of praise for my colleague Senator Loosley and those in the parliamentary delegation that he led there a few months ago because I think it was the process that was mapped in that particular committee's report that has now seen itself crystallised in this fashion.</PARA>

It is a process which will progressively move existing inflexible, time based training systems into flexible, industry responsive, competency based training. In fact, the National Training Board has endorsed the national competency standards for almost 60 per cent of Australia's work force.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time we have seen all states and territories agree to move towards a competency based training system, and this is a major step forward for training in  Australia.

Bread is not a product presently declared for surveillance under the Prices Surveillance Act. Some wheat products are declared, such as Arnott's biscuits and breakfast cereals, but this is because of the structure of those markets. Bread is a very competitive market and those who seek to raise prices excessively, based on spurious claims about the drought, are likely to lose market share to their competitors.</PARA></TALK.START>

In particular, the exercise to locate and identify all the documents requested under parts (c) and (d) of the motion was considerable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kernot has been running around Queensland trying to pretend, mischievously, that she is a member of the Liberal Party. I assure her that we would never have her in the Liberal Party because she and her party are anti-business, anti-rural people, anti-regional Australia and, really, anti any form of sensible government whatsoever in our country. So we would never have her in the Liberal Party in spite of her going around Queensland trying to pretend she is a member of the Liberal Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not want her&mdash;again, nice person as she is. Her political philosophies are so far removed from ours that even the Labor Party intervenes between the Democrats and us. They are to the very left of the Labor Party. Her colleagues understand that. That is why they are getting a bit concerned about her continuing fall in the polls and the fact that the Democrats simply support the Labor Party on every conceivable major issue. It comes as no surprise to me that the Democrats are doing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Port Hinchinbrook is a tourist development. We heard an amazing contribution from Senator Coulter earlier today in which he criticised international tourism into Australia because he said it meant that we could not reach our greenhouse targets for the end of the century. As I  understand Senator Coulter, he is bagging international tourism and saying we should be cutting it out. He says we should be reducing international tourism into Australia because of its greenhouse effect. I find that breathtaking. It is no wonder that with that general philosophy of the Democrats about stopping international tourism into Australia&mdash;one of Australia's major industries, I might say&mdash;they are trying their best to stop this development. </PARA>

But the Queensland government, time and again, has looked at this matter. It has been on the drawing board for some years now. The Queensland government has gone into it properly. It has had the Loder and Bayly Consulting Group report on the matter at hand. That report has said that there are only nine possible&mdash;not definite&mdash;areas of impact that this development might have on environmental matters. It said that of those nine possible areas, one had a moderate risk of direct impact; four were of low risk direct impact; three were of minimal direct impact; and one had no direct impact at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrasted with that is the report that Senator Faulkner has got for himself from Dr Peter Valentine, who says there are 15 distinct World Heritage impacts, any one of which would destroy the World Heritage values of the area.

I have warned the minister that the developer has said that he can now go ahead on his old permits if he wants to do so. The Labor Party has to get its act together and work out which faction is going to have a say and, for heaven's sake, get the development on the way in an environmentally sensitive manner&mdash;and create jobs. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to quote to the Senate from an article by Julian Cribb in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 August this year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If they gave gold medals for national commitment for science, this country wouldn't even make the semi-finals. It lies 18th in the OECD, and quite a few Asian nations are also zipping past.</PARA>
<PARA>Many recent reports such as this have served to highlight the short-sightedness of the federal Labor government in the area of funding for the CSIRO. The government's policy has effectively slashed the CSIRO budget, and this is leading to a significant number of retrenchments. This has had a particularly severe impact on agricultural research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to highlighting some of the reports on this matter, I wish to bring to the Senate's attention a number of statements which have been made by the chief executive of the CSIRO and by the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) in recent committee hearings. In Estimates Committee D on 26 May 1994, Dr Stocker said that as a result of a shortfall per annum in the next triennium of $20.5 million:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We estimate that the consequence of that will be approximately 100 positions in the next financial year and, across the whole triennium, around 200.</PARA>
<PARA>At the same estimates committee hearing, responding to a question from my colleague Senator Gibson regarding redundancies, Senator Cook said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that most of any staff change in CSIRO will occur by natural effluxion of attrition rather than by any particular program of targeted redundancies. I know that in the way in which all this then gets debated the most dramatic and most threatening scenario is put in centre stage as the most likely or probable scenario. In fact, that is not true.</PARA>
<PARA>They are Senator Cook's words from the same estimates committee hearing. In Estimates Committee D on 23 June, Dr Stocker stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I can give you more accurate figures. The reduction in positions, according to Dr Donald's figures for the Institute of Animal Production and Processing, would be from the present number of 1,554 to 1,416 over the three years, only three of which would be research staff.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to reiterate that at that hearing Dr Stocker stated that the reduction over the three years would include only three research staff. I have received advice in the last week that letters were sent to 200 staff members of CSIRO's division of animal production alone. I am informed that these letters included 30 redundancy notices in this one division, and three research scientists in one state, Western Australia, received these redundancy notices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises a legitimate question, and it is a question for which I will be seeking a definitive answer. Does this mean that no other research scientist in the division of animal production located in states other than Western Australia has received a redundancy notice? Further, does it mean that no more research scientists will be made redundant in the next three years, bearing in mind the words of the chief executive in the estimates committee on 23 June?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There can be no doubt that scientific research is vital to the present and future health of the Australian economy, yet this Labor government sees fit to follow a funding policy which causes the retrenchment of CSIRO scientists at this time. We are now seeing the absolute abandonment by this Keating government of Mr Hawke's promise to make Australia the clever country. Those words have never been followed by action, and the government has now gone one step further and chewed those words up and spat them out in the face of the research science community. If there has ever been an area in which Australia has a comparative advantage over our trading partners, it is in the area of scientific research and its application, particularly in the field of agriculture. The government has jeopardised this comparative advantage by further adding to the brain drain in the research science community. In evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on 2 August 1994, a divisional chief said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite what was said earlier, we are losing excellent scientists. In the last few weeks one of my senior managers took early retirement.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are losing people of that calibre, so there is no doubt that we have a significant problem.</PARA>
<PARA>An article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 30 August this year regarding the resignation of Dr Stocker states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Close associates of Dr Stocker were yesterday in no doubt his resignation was the result of cumulative frustration from cuts to CSIRO, internal and external recrimination, perpetual indecisive political tinkering and an "aura of constant criticism" made worse by lack of policy direction.</PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to quote the President of the Australian Academy of Science, Sir Gustav Nossal, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">His resignation should give the Government cause to look at its commitment to science in this country. The science budget has essentially been flat for 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA>This fact was highlighted in evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure on 2 August when, in answer to a question that was raised by my colleague Senator Coulter, Dr Stocker stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we are well behind the world's best, most effective, rapidly developing nations in terms of world trade in research funding.</PARA>
<PARA>As a percentage of gross domestic product, public and private investment in research and development, Australia is at 1.35 per cent of gross domestic product. This is significantly lower than countries such as Japan, at 2.9 per cent; the UK, at 2.1 per cent; and the United States, at 2.7 per cent. In another submission to the Senate standing committee's inquiry, the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Evaluations of the research outcomes of ten projects in the product/technology category have recently been completed by CSIRO (Johnson et al 1992). These revealed the remarkable figures of a return of $2.371 billion for an outlay of $161 million, equivalent to a cost:benefit ratio of 1:15 at a 5% discount rate. There is little doubt that the national public-good figures will be even more remarkable. It seems remarkable that CSIRO should be investing less in sectors that give such a great return on an investment of public funds. It would be far more logical for the organisation to maintain and even enhance its investment in this area, while at the same time be pulling out all stops to achieve greater funding overall. Such an increase could then be used to strengthen the research effort in manufacturing, mining and information technology.</PARA>
<PARA>That was part of the submission that was put to us by the Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research. Along with these figures and reports that have been highlighted&mdash;particularly in relation to the inquiry that is going on at present, but also in relation to other events that have taken place over time&mdash;it would seem that the concern that is being experienced throughout the science community, particularly within CSIRO, is having an effect on the morale of people within the various divisions and is causing a feeling of uncertainty for these research scientists who consider themselves to be a part of the contribution to the clever country of Australia in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all of the evidence that we have heard so far in this inquiry and in the various discussions that have taken place, there has been mention of the uncertainty of research science, particularly within CSIRO which, as the premier research body recognised worldwide for the quality of work and research that is being done, has certainly come under duress. I would like to conclude by again quoting Sir Gustav Nossal. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> on 30 August reported that, at the national science and industry forum, Sir Gustav said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is through fundamental research that the truly major breakthroughs come, which subsequently fertilise more practical developments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The federal Labor government stands condemned for its short-sightedness in failing to take this advice and its attitude towards research science in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza says that the opposition has seen enough, but it has not seen all the evidence. How can opposition senators come to a conclusion before seeing all the evidence? Why do we have these Senate committee inquiries, if opposition senators come in here in a half-baked way and assert a position before the inquiry is completed? Why bother to have these inquiries in the first place? I could understand if a debate was initiated after the inquiry had been completed and opposition senators were attempting to assert a position based on all the evidence, but the opposition has not done that. That is the second reason why I express my concern and surprise at the fact that we are debating this matter today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will move on to the substance of the matter. Senator Ferguson quoted an article by Julian Cribb in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. With due respect to some of my good friends in the gallery, I forewarn Senator Ferguson never to quote a journalist as an authoritative source. I would have thought that in politics that is one of the first lessons learnt. The important thing is to go to source documents and not use the journalist as the source in order to support a case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ferguson asserted that funding to the CSIRO had been slashed; that there have been significant reductions in agricultural research, not just by the CSIRO but generally; and that there have been significant redundancies. That is the crux of his assertion and the crux of his matter of public importance before the Senate today. Nothing could be further from the truth. Total support for R&amp;D innovation, including direct support through appropriations and the estimated effects of tax revenue forgone, is expected to be $539 million in 1994-95, a real increase of five per cent and a continuation of the substantial support in this area over the past decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major component of this increase is an estimated increase in the effect on business R&amp;D of revenue forgone through the industrial R&amp;D tax incentive which increased to $395 million from $377 million. The cooperative research centre program is addressing the need for interaction between researchers and industry, government agencies and universities. Funds for specific R&amp;D grants, rural R&amp;D, National Health and Medical Research Council grants, other health R&amp;D and small R&amp;D grant schemes together rise to $300 million, up five per cent in real terms. I could go on and quote the real increases in general research funding and commitments made by this government but there is no need. Across the board there have been real increases under this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's aggregate national expenditure on R&amp;D substantially increased in the 1980s, reaching $5,109 million or 1.34 per cent of gross domestic product in 1990-91. That was the highest level on record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why do you need to sack scientists?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to the sacking of scientists in a moment. There is no doubt that our current research expenditure levels are the highest on record. This record level of R&amp;D will continue, given the huge increase in business R&amp;D expenditure in the first results reported in the 1992-93 national R&amp;D survey. We might have hoped that R&amp;D would increase at a faster rate&mdash;I do not think anyone here would disagree with that&mdash;but finding the funding is another thing. Generally, R&amp;D in our economy has continued to grow in real terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall debating the issue of general funding to the CSIRO, at least in the agricultural context, on a previous occasion. Budget support for recurrent CSIRO expenditure has hovered around $400 million in constant dollar terms over the last 15 years. Budget support for CSIRO capital expenditure has varied significantly over that period, reflecting decisions to establish major new facilities. I hope that no-one will assert that the rise and fall of capital expenditure necessarily affects CSIRO program outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CSIRO currently earns around $250 million from external sources. Over the past few years the CSIRO has generally allocated the larger share of its appropriation funds&mdash;about 40 per cent&mdash;to rural research. But I think it is important to emphasise that over the last ten years&mdash;the period of the Labor government&mdash;the moneys that have gone into CSIRO agricultural research, the area with which Senator Ferguson was primarily concerned in his contribution to this debate, are not the only moneys going to agricultural research. We have to look at all the money spent in the area of agricultural research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the opposition, some sections of the research community and possibly even the broader community believe in the myth that the CSIRO receives the bulk of agricultural research money. That is not so. The government allocates moneys to a wide variety of areas. Over the last decade this government has established a number of rural R&amp;D corporations. A few examples, by no means all of them, are: cotton, dairy, fisheries, grains, grape and wine, horticulture, land and water, meat, pig R&amp;D&mdash;a favourite topic of Senator Baume&mdash;sugar, wool and the Rural Industry Research and Development Council, which was specifically set up to deal with those areas not covered by other rural research corporations. There are others such as honeybee and tobacco&mdash;I could go on. Almost all of those research councils have been set up by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984-85, shortly after we were elected to government, total Commonwealth contributions&mdash;this is without industry contributions, which are significant&mdash;were $35.72 million a year. What was the contribution in the last financial year? It had grown to $128 million a year. Then there are other areas, such as the cooperative research centres. There is no doubt&mdash;it cannot be refuted&mdash;that the total financial contribution to agricultural research in this country has increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian government science agencies are undergoing a cultural shift. They are moving to strengthen collaboration with industry. It is no longer simply science for science's sake. Collaboration is expected to result in more exploitable scientific outcomes to stimulate industry to perform more research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a specific criticism about CSIRO staff cut-backs. I have with me the latest available figures. In the CSIRO in 1985, the number of equivalent full-time units&mdash;a term I hate but which is used to describe full-time positions&mdash;was 3,007. Last year the number of equivalent full-time positions was 3,117, so there has been a slight increase. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I understand that changes within the CSIRO were recently foreshadowed, but that does not mean there has been a reduction in agricultural research across the entire economy or in this government's contribution to agricultural research. If redundancies do occur&mdash;and I have not seen any evidence of it yet&mdash;that does not mean that those people will not contribute to research in an ongoing way. Given this government's contribution to agricultural research in other areas, and particularly given its very impressive record of expanding the amount of money allocated to research, they are more than likely to be employed in other research projects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that is the crux of the government's case. Senator Murphy will be on the inquiry, the outcome of which Senator Ferguson is pre-empting with this matter today and by coming to a conclusion before the inquiry is conducted. Senator Murphy will be making a contribution based not only on the evidence that he has seen but also on other materials that he has before him. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I conclude, it would be interesting to look at one aspect of the opposition's policy contribution in this area, as scant as it has been to date. The opposition recently released a document, called `Things that something or other'&mdash;I have not heard the title lately&mdash;outlining the strategies upon which its policy will be developed. It denies that it is a policy document. Page 21 of that document is devoted to science and technology and is headed `At the cutting edge.' In view of the current shambles in the opposition, I suppose that is an appropriate description of its science and technology policy. In addition to some general platitudes about science and technology, it makes the point that its key role will be to stop the brain drain of scientists from Australia. There has been no brain drain from Australia. Australia has been experiencing a substantial brain gain, not brain drain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you for your ruling, Mr Acting Deputy President. Judging from that contribution, there is a serious brain drain in the Senate. Over the last 10 years Australia has experienced a net influx, not a brain drain, of more than 28,000 engineers, scientists and academics. Every year over the last 10 years there has been a net gain of scientists coming into this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of this inflow can be gauged by a comparison with the output of degree completions from Australian universities. By 1992 the net annual influx amounted to about 18 per cent of all science and engineering degree completions in Australia. Of course, this is not to say that there are no shortages in some specialist fields but, nevertheless, we are clearly experiencing a very considerable gain in overall terms. Yet the opposition dished up this sort of nonsense in a document&mdash;it is certainly not a policy document&mdash;which the opposition would now prefer to forget and certainly the public has forgotten. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will put down a few other figures which are official figures from the government's own sources. Let me begin by quoting what was said last week by a very senior scientist&mdash;I cannot quote him word for word because we do not have the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> from last week&mdash;when giving evidence to an inquiry. What he said went something along these lines: we are losing our intellectual science capital in Australia and, if something is not done, we will totally exhaust our intellectual science capital. Our science capital is not being replaced. With various modifications, those are the expressions of concern which we have heard from scientist after scientist after scientist in CSIRO&mdash;that senior people with many years of experience are leaving the organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend very slightly the wording of the motion. The motion begins with the words, `The shortsightedness of Labor Government policy.' I would like to include the word `science', making it `science policy', because I think that is what the motion relates to. If one conducted an inquiry among the university science faculties, one would find exactly the same thing. If one went into the medical research institutions around Australia, again one would find exactly the same thing. Of course, that is what Sir Gustav Nossal was referring to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures are quite clear. These are the government's figures, and they are not really in dispute. We are, as Senator Ferguson said, spending only 1.35 per cent of GDP on science research and development. That does not compare well with the OECD average. We claim that we are a member of the OECD; we are one of those 24 nations. The OECD average is 1.87 per cent. So we are well below the average. If we compare Australia with other countries we find that the US spends 2.78 per cent, Japan spends 2.85 per cent and Sweden spends 2.54 per cent. I do not think the government will contest those figures; they are from its own document. It indicates that over the whole range of science activity in this country we are performing very poorly. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will pick up Senator Murphy's point: 0.57 per cent of GDP comes from private industry, which, I agree, compares poorly with the OECD average&mdash;it is roughly half&mdash;of 1.05 per cent. Therein, of course, lies a problem. But the government is saying to industry, `You have to pick up the tab,' and yet evidence after evidence indicates that so many of our major companies in Australia are now foreign owned, that they do their research overseas and that they are not spending the amount of money that they should be spending in Australia. They are spending it elsewhere. Therefore, it behoves the government to relatively increase its expenditure if we are going to meet the sorts of targets that we need to meet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying also applies to areas other than basic science. I have an editorial from the journal <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science</EMPHASIS> of 6 May 1994. John Armstrong, the former IBM vice-president for research, speaks of the costs of research representing only five per cent of the cost of creating a successful product. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He asserted that world leadership in basic research will confer a competitive advantage only if it is coupled with world-class performance in the extensive set of skills, institutions, and investments that are required for the creation of economic wealth.</PARA>
<PARA>We need to spend a great deal more. Given that Australian industry is not spending the money in the R&amp;D area, government must come in and fill that gap or we will simply lose again and again the applications of our basic science overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But there are other indications that we are not performing well. I turn again to an official document, the 1993 national report on Australia's higher education sector, which ranked 36 of our universities from all states except Tasmania in the order of the minimum access scores for those commencing undergraduate courses. The ranking is in a range from one to five, with five being the highest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medicine scored one in every university; law scored one in all but four universities, in which it scored two; science did not score one in a single university. In other words, we have so degraded the teaching of science in our universities that we do not have a single university in Australia that can attract the highest quality of students. If we average these scores across all institutions, we find that science scored 4.2 on this scale of five, which was only marginally better than the least attractive entrance, which was nursing at 4.5. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that this is happening. The attitude that government is presenting to students who might otherwise go into science is, `Why go into science? There is not much point in going into science; there is no future in science. They are shedding their senior staff and the quality of science is falling. Let us go into something else.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Looking at it another way and comparing the quartiles going into various faculties, we find that almost 99 per cent of students who went into medicine came from the upper quartile, whereas some 22 per cent of students in that upper quartile went into science; none from the lower quartile went into medicine; and some 26 or 28 per cent from the lowest quartile went into science. Again, on that measure of the attractiveness of science, this government has failed. It has failed not just in respect of CSIRO; it has failed in the universities and it is failing generally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third index that I think is quite impossible to refute is the index that comes from the recent work of Professor Bourke at the ANU, where he has looked at the relative science citation index in Australia over the last 10 years. To measure not just the number of publications but the effectiveness of those publications, one looks at the number of times a publication is cited by other people. That is a measure of the value of that research generally to other science workers in the field. The work of Bourke, looking at that relative science citation index over time, indicates that, while it was well maintained up until about 1987-88, from that time onwards it has actually dropped by eight per cent. That is a dramatic increase in only a few short years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some areas, for example, the very area that the government is trying to support most intensely&mdash;the telecommunications and electronics area&mdash;it has dropped by 40 per cent. So the quality of our work is really going down the gurgler. When we put all these things together, it is absolutely irrefutable, I believe, that the perceptions of those scientists who have come before our committee expressing these deep concerns, are well grounded in a very factual base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is conflicting evidence before the committee about the cutbacks in CSIRO. The first time Dr Stocker came before the committee, I put to him that he had lobbied before the last budget claiming that CSIRO needed $60 million simply to maintain its expenditure where it would be had expenditure been maintained at the 1983 level, taking into account inflation. He went on to admit that they in fact had been cut by slightly over $20 million. When I put to him that that amounts to $80 million per year each year for the next triennium, he agreed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly true, as we have heard from the government, that more recently the government has attempted to cover its tracks and claim that expenditure in the rural areas has been increased. Frankly, the figures do not add up. The initial evidence is clear and I think it indicates that CSIRO has indeed been cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I think that the state of science in Australia is extremely parlous; the quality of our science is decreasing; the government is not recognising the seriousness of it; it is particularly pulling funds away from fundamental and basic research; and it needs to get back to and more strongly support research. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I commend Senator Ferguson on bringing this important matter to the parliament today, which is put in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The short sightedness of Labor Government policy leading to the retrenchment of CSIRO scientists at a time when science and research is vitally important to a competitive and successful Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, can I say how disappointing it is that the Australian Labor government has failed to recognise the substance of this matter&mdash;and that is that science and technology, and the application of science and technology, are so vital to the future of a competitive Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is particularly tragic that this government has cut $60 million from CSIRO's budget over a period of three years. Australia's premier scientific organisation, a body with a strong international reputation, having its funding slashed so enormously demonstrates in very vivid terms the low priority that this government attaches to science. Probably in no other way could the government more vividly demonstrate that low priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has been raised today because it coincides with notices being sent out retrenching Australian scientists, putting Australian scientists out of work as a result of this government's deliberate policy. That is why it is important that Senator Ferguson bring this matter to the Senate for debate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have met with some of those scientists as I have travelled around the country visiting CSIRO establishments. I have talked to them about their work, their training, their hopes and their dreams, and their frustration at having those dreams and hopes shortened as a result of this foolish policy. Young scientists, not just old scientists, are losing work in an environment where there is not a lot of other opportunity. The figures show that, unfortunately, the contribution of industry to science in this country is still low. If we want both basic research and, in many cases, applied research, we are still reliant on government, and yet government is cutting back this funding to CSIRO and these scientists are being put out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government responded, although I do not think Senator Sherry was well briefed. If a minister had bothered to attend&mdash;I accept that Senator Cook is unwell&mdash;he would have no doubt used the argument that it is not so much the scientists that are being retrenched but the technicians and administrative staff. But the technicians are, in many cases, just as important to the success of scientific development as are the more highly academically qualified scientists. They are absolutely critical to the maintenance of the scientific programs and it is, therefore, an inadequate response by the government to say that it is others, rather than the most senior scientists, who are losing their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole position of CSIRO is extremely worrying. The chief executive has just announced that he is not prepared to take an extra term, which was a blow to the organisation. It is not just the frustration of having its funding cut. The difficulties that have come about with the shift of headquarters from Canberra to Melbourne&mdash;in fact, the body seems to operate two headquarters at the moment&mdash;and the very expensive legal actions that have come out of attempts to commercialise CSIRO without giving the scientists and support staff an adequate administrative or legal background to do so, have also had an effect on reducing morale within that important organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But perhaps what has hit CSIRO more than anything else has been the attitude of this government, the attitude of the previous minister, Senator Schacht and, more recently, his successor, Senator Cook. Perhaps I could do no better than to refer to one of the important publications in this area, `Scitech'&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Science Technology</EMPHASIS> is its full name&mdash;which, in its current edition of September of this year, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has . . . been increasingly political interference in CSIRO starting with Senator Schacht who tried to impose his own agenda on the CSIRO Board . . . His successor Senator Cook, although much more low key, has also imposed political pressures by forbidding CSIRO to brief opposition politicians without informing his office and having a member of his staff present.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cook, in effect, sought to oppose that agenda. There is nothing wrong with that, but he did so without proper briefing or understanding of the issues. He sought to restructure CSIRO from a basis of being poorly informed. Senator Schacht believed he knew better, did not listen to advice, made an awful mess of the administration of the portfolio and, of course, had to be removed. Senator Cook, who sees political evil around every corner, has had to adopt very much the thought police approach. Although I could say that he seems to have waived it in relation to CSIRO briefings to me, he has not done so in relation to others, and I think that is a matter of great regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess the resignation very recently of Ms Pat Kennedy from CSIRO is just another demonstration of this government's attitude. There is no doubt that, in effect, she was forced out by her active involvement in pursuing the interests of the nation in science, and CSIRO in particular, in the parliamentary process, which was her job. But because her views were in conflict with those of Senator Schacht, in the first instance, and Senator Cook, more recently, the government preferred her to go rather than have her pursue her very worthwhile work. That is a matter of great regret. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time that this government recognised that science and technology is critically important to this country. The government should fund it appropriately, recognise that CSIRO is a body of which we should be proud and which requires proper financial support, and address seriously the issues raised in this matter rather than attempt to dismiss them. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regarding what Senator Coulter said before, he seemed to emphasise the government's funding with respect to research in general, particularly as it related to educative university research, and so on. Certainly, in terms of what Commonwealth funding has been provided in the last 10 years, budget data shows that university research funding had reached $1.3 billion by 1993-94, and had grown in real terms by 67 per cent since this government came to office in 1983. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This compares with real increases of 53 per cent in all Commonwealth support for science and innovation over the same period. Again, Australia's output of scientific papers over the 12-year period to 1992 was 2.3 per cent of all world research papers. Per head of population, our output ranks eighth in the world. What has happened in this debate is that people have come in here and quoted very selectively from various things. Senator Ferguson said that we were ranked 18th in terms of public expenditure but that is simply not the case&mdash;that is deliberately misleading. The fact is that we are ranked about sixth in terms of public expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very easy to use figures in the broad sense, but as Senator Coulter knows, in some of those other countries he is talking about there is much greater private sector investment in research. That is one problem we have in this country. I will give an example. When we talk about government policy, particularly when it is raised by the opposition, it is always appropriate to have a look at what the opposition's policy is. We have some information called `Creating an Innovative Culture' from the Fightback document of March 1993. I will quote one or two things from it. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The restructuring of the scientific and technological research bureaucracy so that it becomes an operational arm of government policy making a more effective means of coordinating planning linkages between the public research sector and industry groups.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on further to talk about the role of government. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The role of government is therefore, first and foremost, a strategic one; to ensure that policies across the range of portfolio areas are integrated to provide the optimal framework to encourage and facilitate research and development.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that the government has implemented a range of things. In particular, we introduced the 150 per cent tax deduction&mdash;and we have created the CRCs. The Liberals were going to abolish both of those things. When those opposite want to criticise the government for its policy, it would certainly pay them to look at the old adage that people in glasshouses should not throw stones. I am afraid their house has well and truly shattered on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, we are part way through an inquiry. On Friday, 2 September we took evidence from the senior executive of the CSIRO, John Stocker, and some of the directors of the institutes. I would like to quote from some evidence John Stocker gave. It relates to expenditure by the CSIRO. According to page 930 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> report he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This then gives a picture across the last triennium which demonstrates that, in appropriation terms and in sponsored research terms, the expenditure that CSIRO has afforded the rural industries has not changed dramatically.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Stocker presented a range of diagrams. Those diagrams showed subsequently that there had generally been about a seven per cent increase in rural research funding. Again we hear claims about scientists being sacked. We can all make spurious claims here about why that might be the case. The opposition, of course, wants to blame the government. But we could look at a whole range of factors. A lot of the evidence that has been received by the committee is more a criticism of the management within the CSIRO than the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked one of the witnesses from within the CSIRO about funding. I said, `Where do you get the view that the government has cut funding?' He said, `I read it in the newspaper.' The figures presented by the people who should know&mdash;that is, the senior executive officer and the directors&mdash;clearly demonstrate that that is not the case. Another important factor regarding research in this country is to try to get greater private sector input.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset I would like to take up the point raised by Senator Murphy and Senator Sherry that it was too early in the piece to debate a matter of public importance of this sort because a Senate committee inquiry relating to the CSIRO is still being conducted. The fact that an inquiry is being conducted has not stopped the government or the CSIRO board from proceeding with selling off farms, dismissing research scientists or cutting off their funding. So this is a very opportune time to tell the people of Australia what is happening while the inquiry is going on. That is exactly why we brought this matter on today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy, in the limited time he had to speak&mdash;and he could not even use that properly&mdash;told us that the committee is not getting the sort of evidence that it had expected to get. I do not believe that we go into any inquiry expecting to be given any sort of evidence. We see what the evidence is and take it as it comes. I do not know whether Senator Murphy was at the meeting of the committee in Armidale&mdash;I do not believe he was there; if he was, he was there in presence only and not in mind, and he did not take any notice of what was going on. He will get his chance to take notice the week after next at Yallebee and in Western Australia as a whole, so I invite him to hold his comments until then. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason we proposed this matter of public importance today was to point out to the people of Australia what is coming out of the inquiry and to ask the CSIRO and the government to stop sacking people until we find out what is really going on. The terms of this matter of public importance is the short-sightedness of the government in its funding of CSIRO. The government has not only been short-sighted in the last 12 months, 18 months, two years or three years; it has been short-sighted on this matter ever since it came to government in 1983. This government will need something more than minor surgery to get it out of this situation. It will need to have a complete eye transplant if it is to see what is going on in CSIRO and what is causing the lack of research in Australia. That is why we asked for the inquiry in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Murphy also accused me of being politically motivated in calling for this inquiry. He knows as well as I do that this inquiry is being conducted because we are reflecting the concern of CSIRO scientists and CSIRO personnel all around Australia. If he does not want to admit that, he should at least stop telling pork pies or something like that to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has shown a lack of interest in CSIRO as is evidenced by the fact that in the last 4 1/2 years&mdash;Senator Childs, who is the chairman of the Senate committee that is conducting this inquiry and who is doing quite a good job, if I may say so, is laughing at the awkward position that Senator Murphy has got himself into&mdash;there have been five ministers in the game. During the time that Dr Stocker has been in charge of the CSIRO, he has had to deal with five different government ministers. No wonder he declined to take up the invitation to renew his contract. It is probably fortunate for him that he took that decision. He will go to a job with better pay anyhow, although he will be a loss to the CSIRO and to science right throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, except for Mr Barry Jones from the other place, there has not been a minister in charge of the science portfolio, which takes in the CSIRO, who has had a scientific and technological background or even anything to do with industry.

In the light of this shortfall, what did the government attempt to do to keep these scientists on? It costs about $190,000 to keep a scientist at the bench doing research. The government decided to sell off the research farms. On the face of it, even I thought that may be a way out, although I do not ever believe in selling off the farm because once one sells off the farm one is never in a position to buy it back within 12 months, even if it were available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farms in Yallebee and Armidale&mdash;and Senator Childs would be able to back me up on this&mdash;were set up for research. The government said, `Sell them off and lease other land.' I would like to know where land can be leased and how it would be set up for research. Those research places have paddocks down to four acres, three acres and one acre. The fencing, the sheds and the research laboratories are virtually worth more than the price of the land. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of this bill continues the historic process that began with the High Court's Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government moved quickly to respond to that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year Parliament passed the Native Title Act, giving legislative effect to the court's rejection of the doctrine of terra nullius, and its recognition of native title to land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is enormous symbolic value in the Mabo decision and the subsequent legislation. For the first time in our history, the inherent rights of indigenous Australians have been recognised and given statutory protection. These developments indicate that as a nation we are maturing; we are able to acknowledge the violence and destruction of our history since European occupation and to accept the responsibility we all have to work towards a new relationship. Much has been achieved, but justice has not yet been done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Justice has not been done because the majority of Australia's indigenous people live on the margins of economic, social and cultural life in this country. We may ask how this can be so, in a country with one of the highest standards of living in the world, a country which prides itself on giving everyone a fair go. It is so, Mr President, because the vast majority of indigenous Australians have been dispossessed, either in whole or part, of that which is most precious to their sense of history and spirituality, that most essential component of their heritage&mdash;their land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Contemporary western culture tends to view land as a commodity, something which can enrich us, not something which we must cherish and nurture, and which will in turn nurture us. It is difficult for non-indigenous Australians to understand what Australia's indigenous people feel about the loss of their land. It is difficult, therefore, to comprehend the extent of their dispossession. Nevertheless, we must try to comprehend it. Unless we understand the importance of land to indigenous peoples, we cannot come to terms with the extent of the loss.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it is a great ambition of this government to establish a new relationship between indigenous Australians and the wider community. We established the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation to guide the nation towards greater understanding and justice, greater unity and universal respect for Australia's indigenous heritage. We introduced native title legislation in recognition that indigenous peoples owned the land before colonisation, and to facilitate the formal legal recognition of those native title interests which have never been extinguished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process however has just begun. The native title legislation, while of profound symbolic significance, will not benefit all indigenous peoples. Because most have been dispossessed they have been unable to maintain the continued association upon which proof of native title depends. We are now ready for another step; the step represented by this bill, which recognises the injustice flowing from dispossession, and goes some way towards redressing it by providing a means for indigenous communities to acquire, manage and maintain land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Land Fund is the first of the social justice measures to be formulated, and represents the major financial element in the government's proposed social justice measures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be further measures on which the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and ATSIC will advise the government later this year. These measures will form part of the social justice package I announced when introducing the native title legislation, and which will be directed towards removing structural and institutional barriers to full participation in Australian economic life by its indigenous peoples, and towards safeguarding and developing indigenous culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this legislation complements the native title legislation, and like that Act, the bill before the house is the product of wide-ranging consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We sought the views of peak indigenous, farming, environmental, industry and church groups. I have had meetings with Aboriginal representatives and a measure of consensus has been reached on the main features of the bill. I have sought the views of Premiers and Chief Ministers, and of our colleagues on the other side of the house, as well as the Democrat and Green senators.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our colleagues on the other side have expressed their opposition to the Land Fund, saying there are higher priorities in Aboriginal affairs. There are indeed many other things to be done, but we maintain that land ownership is fundamental to the well-being of the indigenous community, and should be addressed as a matter of priority. The benefits flowing from re-establishing indigenous attachment to the land will not only be cultural and social, but will lead to improved economic well-being. I hope the Opposition will be swayed in the interests of justice and equity, in the cause of righting historical wrongs, in the hope that we can deliver to future generations an Australia without the scars and stigma of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Key Aspects of the Legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes the Land Fund and the Indigenous Land Corporation, with the purpose of enabling indigenous people to acquire land, and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations. The Indigenous Land Corporation will be a new, independent and commercially oriented statutory body. The government has adopted this structure because such a corporation will ensure a dedicated focus on land matters and will have specialised expertise in land management, land use assessment and environmental issues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Land Fund will receive an allocation from consolidated revenue, pay to the Indigenous Land Corporation a specified amount each year for land acquisition and management, and invest the remainder. After ten years, it is intended that the investments made by the Land Fund will provide sufficient income to cover the allocations to the corporation, and Commonwealth contributions will cease.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first instalment was allocated in this year's budget&mdash;$200 million into the fund, with $25 million to be paid to the corporation, and the remainder to be invested. The Fund will be set up as a Trust Account under the Public Account, and subject to the provisions of part 9 of the Audit Act. To make for a smooth transition, for the first three years, ATSIC will continue with its land acquisition and management programs, and will receive its annual allocation from the Land Fund. After this period, ATSIC's financial allocation will transfer to the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Using the monies paid to it by the Land Fund, the corporation will be responsible for acquiring land, and transferring it to indigenous communities. It may also make grants to indigenous organisations for the purpose of acquiring land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is very much aware of the need for land to be managed in an effective manner. The corporation will therefore carry out an equally important function of promoting and supporting the sustainable management of indigenous-held land. It will do this mainly by entering into agreements with the land holders about the use and management of land; the corporation will have the flexibility to be able to take a direct role in the management of indigenous lands to the extent set down in the agreements. On occasions it may also provide direct grants to land holders for land management purposes. While the government accepts that not all indigenous people will seek to make profits from their ownership of land, we are concerned that they receive sufficient assistance and encouragement to manage their land in a sustainable way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operations of the Indigenous Land Corporation will be governed by a number of principles. It is to adopt a strategic approach, and where it operates on a commercial basis it will do so in line with sound business principles. In addition, in carrying out its functions, the corporation must have regard to maximising the employment of indigenous people and utilising indigenous enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation will be required to prepare national and regional land strategies, covering three to five year periods, and dealing with land acquisition, management and environmental issues. Copies of the documents setting out these strategies will be available on request. Regional bodies including ATSIC Regional Councils will be involved in planning for acquisitions at the local level. The corporation will be able to establish subsidiaries to carry out its functions, allowing for direct participation by local indigenous representatives in land management activities in their area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is designed to meet the aspirations of indigenous people and they must therefore have control over decisions made by the corporation. This is reflected in the structure of the board of directors administering the corporation. At least five of the members must be Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders, and the Chairperson of ATSIC will be included as an ex officio member. In recognition of ATSIC's role as a significant vehicle for indigenous self-determination, at least one other member must be an ATSIC Commissioner. All the directors must have experience in land or environmental management, business or financial management, or in indigenous community life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The corporation has significant powers to conduct its business in the interest of self-determination, including significant commercial functions. The Minister may request and obtain any information about the activities of the corporation. The Minister makes the appointments to the Board of Directors, in consultation with ATSIC and the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has expressed reservations about the Land Fund. His concern is that land acquired under Land Fund provisions, and subject to normal title holding rules, will be claimed under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, and thus lead to an inappropriate increase in land held under inalienable title. This will not result from the legislation before the house today. We have included in the legislation a clause prohibiting claims under the Land Rights Act being made in relation to land acquired by the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Implementation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Native Title Act provides for the establishment of the Land Fund, under s201. However, it does not provide enough scope for the establishment and operations of the Indigenous Land Corporation in the way we consider essential for an effective response to the need for land. That is why this bill was necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an interim measure, the Fund will be set up by regulations under the Native Title Act. We plan that the corporation begin operations on 1 January 1995, when this legislation comes into force, and s201 of the Native Title Act which sets up the Fund will be repealed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need for the interim arrangement as monies have already been allocated, and will have to be invested pending the establishment of the Indigenous Land Corporation under this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC, as the body with primary responsibility for indigenous affairs, will from 1 January undertake the day to day administrative arrangements for the Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, through millennia the indigenous people of this continent have demonstrated extraordinary strength and resilience, and never more so than in the past two hundred years. Since European settlement they have survived the alienation of their land, the destruction of their culture, brutality and disease, the heartbreaking severance of family and community bonds. They have survived, but the losses have been immeasurable and proof of the damage remains all too plainly to be seen. With the native title legislation, Australia took an historic step by finally acknowledging the truth that Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders were the original owners of the continent. In the legislation before the Senate today, we are giving the spirit of that legislation more tangible expression. We are creating the means by which land may be returned to Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders&mdash;and with the foundation of their traditions and identity thus partially restored, we trust that they may be able to protect and revitalise their communities, their culture and their heritage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend this bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill proposes to amend section 6A of the Education Services for Overseas Students (Registration of Providers and Financial Regulation) Act 1991 (the ESOS act) which relates to the operation of notified trust accounts. The bill proposes to amend subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS act to allow Regulations to be made which exempt providers, either in whole or in part, from the requirements concerning notified trust accounts under section 6A of the ESOS act. The amendment will provide more flexible arrangements for the exemption of providers from the requirement to operate a notified trust account.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments are intended to strengthen the protection that the ESOS act offers international students and to ensure the international reputation and growth of this industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 6A of the ESOS act currently requires providers who are not exempt from the financial Regulations of the ESOS act, to pay into notified trust accounts all pre-paid course money received directly or indirectly from overseas students. The ESOS act also specifies that withdrawals or payments from notified trust accounts may not be made except in accordance with the Regulations under the ESOS act. Subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS act only allows Regulations to be made that exempt providers completely from the requirements to operate a notified trust account. Currently, there is no provision to make Regulations for partial exemption of providers from the requirements to operate a notified trust account. The aim of the bill is to amend the Regulation making power in section 6A so that Regulations can be made that will exempt providers either in whole or in part from the operation of section 6A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ESOS act was introduced in 1991 to provide both financial protection and quality assurance for international students in Australian institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993, the ESOS act was amended to enhance the quality and integrity of our educational products and to strengthen the protection the act offers to international students' pre-paid funds. The ESOS Regulations were also amended to include provisions relating to the operation of notified trust accounts and membership of a tuition assurance scheme (TAS)&mdash;the primary objective of which was to ensure that international students receive the education and training for which they paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notified trust account and tuition assurance scheme Regulations were subject to a notice of motion of disallowance in the Senate and then referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training for consideration. Following that Committee's hearing, I proposed a package of amendments to the ESOS legislation to address industry concerns about the Regulations. This included amending the trust account Regulations to meet industry's concerns about agents' commissions and enrolment fees, in return for retaining the tuition assurance scheme provisions in a modified form to meet the Government's concern for a safety net.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the package, the tuition assurance scheme Regulations have been amended, without the further need to amend the ESOS act. Representations from major industry associations to my Department indicate their support for these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Advice from Attorney-General's Department indicated that, in order to amend the trust account Regulations, subsection 6A(5) of the ESOS act would first have to be amended. The bill before Parliament therefore seeks to amend the ESOS act to give effect to my proposals to address industry concerns about the trust account Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The growth of Australia's international education industry depends on the confidence that students overseas have in the quality of the courses they undertake and the protection of the monies they invest in receiving an Australian education. The confidence of students is fundamental to the credibility and viability of the industry which accounts for over $1 billion in export earnings.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 (the act) in accordance with 1994-95 Budget Decisions and other decisions made by the Government in respect of higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill's provisions include an amendment to repayment arrangements for certain students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme&mdash;HECS. The measure, which will come into effect on 1 January 1995, will require that people who leave full-time education for the first time have their HECS debt for that financial year calculated on a pro-rata basis in accordance with the proportion of the year spent in the work force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision, which is estimated to bring forward $15 million in HECS revenue in the period 1995-96 to 1997-98 alone, will shorten the repayment period for affected students without increasing the size of the debt for any person. As importantly, it addresses an anomaly in present HECS repayment arrangements by ensuring consistency with the Income Tax Rates Act 1986 which pro-rates the standard tax-free threshold for people who leave full-time education for the first time. It should be noted that as these arrangements only apply to persons leaving full-time education from 1 January 1995, few people will be affected by the changes in the 1994-1995 financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend Section 17 to increase the amount of maximum grant available for operating purposes in 1993 as well as transfer funds from the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 for appropriation under the Aboriginal Education (Supplementary Assistance) Act 1989. However, the total amount provided by the Commonwealth to institutions for operating purposes has not changed. Although the total amount legislated under Section 17 has increased, this is offset by a corresponding decrease in the amount provided to institutions from the HECS Trust Account. The variation reflects a lower than anticipated Commonwealth contribution required to discharge student liabilities in 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other amendments to the act put forward in this bill include minor modifications to the Open Learning Deferred Payment Scheme. These amendments will clarify some operational characteristics of the scheme. In particular, it will remove the current restriction on the number of units for which an eligible client may defer payment in the first semester to allow students to defer payment for up to a maximum of 8 study units for any two consecutive semesters. Further the amendments will clarify that the amount of basic charge payable by students under the Open Learning Deferred Payments Scheme for a study unit in the December/March semester is the amount payable for study units in the following semesters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the bill seeks to amend the definition of `Overseas Student'. Currently members of certain foreign armed forces enter Australia in the course of their duties and are considered under the act to be HECS liable students. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs treats these members of the armed forces as temporary residents. For consistency, it is more appropriate that these individuals are regarded as full fee-paying students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes a range of provisions to correct anomalies in previous amendments to the act which are of a technical nature and should be rectified so that a consolidated version of the act can be printed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will recall that on 24 March of this year my colleague the Minister for Communications and the Arts, the Hon. Michael Lee, provided the House with details of the government's response, to that time, to allegations that Telecom had monitored and recorded telephone conversations of certain customers without their consent. He indicated at that time that he would report back to the parliament on all of these matters. On 29 August Senator Bourne tabled a number of documents in the Senate concerning these and other issues related to Telecom's performance of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this statement today is to report progress on Telecom network and customer issues, including those raised by Senator Bourne, and to inform the Senate of government initiatives to expedite the basic goals of ensuring that all Australians have access to a telephone service that is affordable and works to world-class standards and that our telephone carriers conform to the highest standards of ethical behaviour and customer service. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Police Investigations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criminal investigation which the Minister for Communications and the Arts initiated in January into allegations that Telecom had recorded phone calls of certain customers without their consent is still being finalised. The report of the Australian Federal Police investigating team is under examination by the Director of Public Prosecutions. The later allegations by Mr Robert Bray that his telephone conversations were monitored without his consent also remain under investigation, and it is important that nothing is said or done which would in any way attempt to intervene or pre-empt the finding of these investigations. I can, however, assure honourable senators that the government will take whatever action is necessary arising from the completion of these investigations. </PARA>
<PARA><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Network and Customer Issues</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the government's further initiatives, let me first deal with the performance of the telephone network. It is essential that the overall performance of each of Australia's carrier networks be of a high standard and meet consumer expectations. Carrier network performance should be measured independently against appropriate minimum standards that apply to residential and business customers and metropolitan and country residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications and the Arts will ask Austel to accelerate its current development of end-to-end network performance standards with a view to having these in place by early 1995. The Austel network performance standards will be mandatory, and failure to comply with these standards will be a breach of the carriers' licence conditions. Austel will monitor performance against these standards and will also review them to ensure that they reflect the changing telecommunications environment. There has been, and will continue to be, consumer input into this process through Austel's Standards Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Austel will, in addition, improve the information content of its quarterly quality of service report. This development will focus on</PARA>
<PARA>switched telephone network performance for customers and will seek to provide information on a wider range of services and quality of service measures than presently reported. Austel intends to consult with consumers and major users in this development. Austel will develop a capability independent of the carriers to monitor compliance with these mandatory standards and will be empowered to appoint independent consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important issue is the ongoing modernisation of telecommunications networks in Australia, including that of Telecom. Telecom has previously developed a major upgrading of its telephone network. To ensure that upgrading proceeds on an equitable basis, the Commonwealth will enter into a formal network development deed with Telecom&mdash;broadly comparable to existing network development deeds with Optus and Vodafone. Targets will be set in consultation with Telecom and Austel, with priority being given to digitisation of exchanges and improving services in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for negotiation of the deed will be threefold: Telecom's future mode of operation, FMO, plan&mdash;this provides for expenditure of $3.3 billion over the next five years; the recommendations in Austel's April 1994 COT report for network modernisation; and the existing commitments on roll out of calling line identification, CLI, capability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This network development deed will be commercial-in-confidence, as are the Optus and Vodafone network development deeds. It will, however, include an annex outlining the major developments and this will be tabled in parliament. Clearly there is also room for improvement in Telecom's relations with its customers and a positive, non-adversarial approach is obviously preferable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications and the Arts has previously welcomed Telecom's decision to implement the recommendations of Austel's report on the COT cases, particularly those recommendations on customer complaints. Austel has reported that Telecom is instituting new customer complaint handling procedures recommended by the independent Coopers and Lybrand study. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, Telecom will be asked to produce quickly a customer charter detailing in plain English what Telecom's customers are entitled to expect in terms of service. It will include clear information on the position with regard to liability, compensation and customer privacy. Telecom will settle appropriate wording for the charter with Austel, the Trade Practices Commission and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter will be effectively communicated to customers through bill inserts, public advertisements and other means after consultation with consumer groups and relevant government agencies. Of equal importance, internal staff training will emphasise the importance of the charter to Telecom staff, with particular emphasis on representation of liability and customer privacy. The Minister for Communications and the Arts will be encouraging the other carriers to follow Telecom's example and adopt a customer charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the Minister for Communications and the Arts has expressed concern that cost remains a barrier preventing many Australians from having a home telephone service. New measures to deal with affordability are currently being discussed with Telecom, in consultation with consumer and welfare groups, and the minister will be announcing details shortly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the telecommunications regulator, Austel, has adequate resources to deal with consumer complaints. To this end, the Minister for Communications and the Arts has requested that Austel establish a special unit, headed by a general manager reporting to a designated Austel member, to manage network performance issues, quality of service and customer complaints about difficult network faults and related privacy issues. The unit will meet with complainants on a regular basis and endeavour to ensure that all matters are dealt with quickly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some concern has been expressed about carriers' liability for their actions. Telecom's statutory immunity from suit was removed completely by the Telecommunications Act 1991; that is, it is now in no more nor less favourable a situation than other carriers in Australia or, indeed, other companies. Telecom will be asked to expedite implementation of relevant recommendations in Austel's COT report to ensure that it does not misrepresent the extent of its liability to its customers. This will be done through revised instructions to staff, internal training and appropriate public information, including the proposed customer charter, with Austel overseeing this process through the new unit I have mentioned. Austel will shortly commence a public inquiry into the setting of limits on amounts recoverable in tort in relation to an act done, or an omission made, in relation to the supply of a specified basic carriage service. This will enable all interested parties to make submissions on the practical application of carrier liability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protection of customer privacy by telecommunications carriers is an issue of the gravest concern to the government, and we are determined that this will be reflected in the policies and actions of the carriers. Honourable senators will recall that in January the Minister for Communications and the Arts asked the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to review the Telecommunications (Interception) Act to determine whether amendments were necessary to limit the breadth of the exemption given to carrier employees. The Attorney-General will be introducing amendments to the act to clarify the exemption for carrier employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stringent new privacy guidelines developed by Telecom at the request of the Minister for Communications and the Arts and in consultation with the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman and the Privacy Commissioner have now been adopted by Optus and Vodafone also. Telecom's proposed external audit of its privacy policy will be published as well as tabled in the parliament and made available to Austel for prior scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has also asked Telecom to open discussions with the relevant unions to achieve amendments to the necessary awards to allow any internal Telecom disciplinary proceedings involving allegations of privacy breaches, including allegations of voice monitoring and recording, to be required to be chaired by an independent party. In addition, Telecom will be asked to appoint an independent party to review existing disciplinary procedures, including those that should apply to all levels of management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the allegations of Mr Bray, the Minister for the Communications and the Arts has asked the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to review the privacy aspects of those allegations, particularly in relation to Telecom's privacy guidelines. Broader privacy issues will be able to be considered by the Austel Privacy Advisory Committee that the minister announced recently. The Minister for Communications and the Arts has asked that priority be given to disclosure of customer information, particularly silent number information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of the Freedom of Information Act by the COT complainants during the arbitration process disclosed the need for Telecom to review how it dealt with FOI requests. Telecom will be asked to ensure full implementation of the major reforms to its freedom of information procedures that were indicated as a result of that review. Such implementation is already under way, including centralised control to ensure prompt handling of requests, a network of FOI coordinators, standardised handling procedures and improved staff training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Communications and the Arts will be indicating to Telecom that he would expect it would implement any recommendations that the Commonwealth Ombudsman might make with regard to administration of the FOI Act. The minister is advised that the fast-track arbitration procedures&mdash;for the first four COT cases&mdash;has been settled and the secondary arbitration procedures&mdash;for the next 11 COT-type cases&mdash;have been substantially settled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He will ask the Telecommunications Industry Ombudsman to report to him, on conclusion of the arbitration, on any findings of general application to the telecommunications industry that he has made as a result of the arbitration process. In establishing if he can make any findings, he will consult with the arbitrator and the other consultants involved in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the permanent arbitration procedures for settling claims, Telecom will be asked to finalise the rules for these as a matter of priority. Austel's quarterly reports on COT implementation and carrier quality of service will be tabled in the parliament, and I will table Austel's first quarterly COT report and the quality of service report for the March 1994 quarter at the end of my statement. After the receipt of each COT quarterly report, the Minister for Communications and the Arts proposes to request the chairman of Telecom to detail measures to address any concerns which Austel has identified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's recent reforms to government business enterprise reporting and operating arrangements have increased GBE accountability, and the minister is discussing with the Telecom board ways of enhancing their reporting arrangements to government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can assure honourable senators that the government is committed to having all of these network and customer issues dealt with in a positive and open manner. We are confident that the arrangements detailed here will ensure this happens, and will provide proper parliamentary scrutiny of Telecom's future actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing on behalf of the Minister for Communications and the Arts, I would like to thank Senator Bourne for raising her concerns about Telecom's service performance and for assisting the government to respond to the needs and concerns of Telecom's customers. I table the statement, Austel's first quarterly report on the progress of Telecom's implementation of recommendations of Austel's COT cases report, and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Quality of Service</EMPHASIS> bulletin for the March quarter 1994.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats welcome this statement as a very important step towards solving the problems within Telecom that we have been concerned about for a long time. This statement is a result of the documents I tabled on 29 August and my letter to the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) in which I set out our proposals for solving the major problems revealed in those documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our subsequent discussions with the minister have left us in no doubt that he takes our concerns seriously. A comparison of his statement with my letter of 29 August shows that he has responded to every one of our proposals. We have reservations that some of the proposed solutions do not go far enough&mdash;and I will go into that in detail in a moment&mdash;but overall we believe that this response is constructive and thorough, and we thank him for that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns about Telecom began more than a year ago when we were approached by the Casualties of Telecom group, a group of business proprietors who complained of chronic phone faults and poor treatment by Telecom. But the matters that I raised in this chamber on 29 August go much wider than the COTs, and so does the minister's response. They go to the performance of Telecom's network&mdash;especially in the country&mdash;and its responsibility to any customer experiencing difficult network faults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Casualties of Telecom deserve a good measure of credit for the changes announced by the minister today. Their perseverance over many years has not simply been in pursuit of self-interest; it has also been a public interest campaign from which all Australians will now benefit. It is our hope that these changes will make the finalisation of Telecom's dispute with the COTs more likely and more imminent, hopefully, and will also minimise the risk that such long-running and damaging disputes will occur again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the specific measures announced in today's statement are concerned, the Democrats, like all Australians, have been absolutely appalled at recent revelations about possible phone monitoring and recording by Telecom without customer consent. Those matters have been investigated by the Australian Federal Police and are being considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said in his statement, it is important that these investigations should not be pre-empted. However, we are concerned that, if the Director of Public Prosecutions does not prefer charges, this leaves unanswered an important question: how widespread has the practice of covert monitoring and recording been, and why was it being done? In our view, the public has the right to know the answer. Should the DPP not proceed with prosecutions, we will pursue this matter further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are strong believers in the need to subject telecommunications carriers to rigorous and enforceable network performance standards. Today's commitment is very welcome, and we look forward to Austel's detailed end-to-end network standards with much interest. We also welcome the minister's statement that they will not be based on Telecom's new service verification test, which passes a phone service as adequate if it demonstrates a call success rate of only 90.2 per cent. Australians should be able to expect a much better service guarantee than that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that network performance standards are kept under constant review to reflect customer expectations, technological developments and trends in international best practice. It is equally important that the performance of all carriers against the standards be audited and that under-performance be quickly corrected. Today's statement makes those commitments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are pleased that our concerns about substandard telephone services in country areas are addressed in this statement. The government intends to enter into a network development deed with Telecom&mdash;the broad parameters of which will be made public&mdash;and to give priority to digitisation of exchanges and improving services in rural areas. In the absence of this commitment, it is far too likely that country areas will get the benefits of digital technology last. As the documents I tabled showed, rural services are already too far behind the city, and the gap must not grow further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would ask the minister to ensure that the special needs of people in remote areas are addressed in the network development deed&mdash;for example, in relation to the provision of a second phone line for connection to a fax. We have had representations from the Isolated Childrens' and Parents' Association that a fax line is essential for their childrens' education but that some people in New South Wales have been waiting more than nine months for a fax line and still do not have one. I understand that the problem is due to the availability of one particular part but it seems that a delay of that length is far too long and could be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The commitment that Telecom will develop a customer charter with an accurate and plain English explanation of Telecom's service obligations, including the contentious question of its liability, is very pleasing indeed. We welcome the involvement of Austel, the Trade Practices Commission and the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs in the drafting of the charter, and can only say that this is long overdue. We support the minister's call for the other carriers to follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of liability is a vexed one. The Democrats accept Telecom's longstanding argument that it should not be held liable for the consequences of the failure of an individual phone call. However, we do believe that carriers should not be immune from liability where a customer receives a substandard phone service for a significant period of time. Not only is it a basic matter of justice, it is also an important motivation for improved carrier performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to us that the network performance standards will set a benchmark which the courts would interpret as, to coin a phrase, the liability line in the sand. We hope that is so but we have no legal advice to that effect. It is a matter we hope will be clarified during Austel's proposed inquiry into an appropriate limit of carrier liability. I suspect that inquiry will hear hotly contested and widely divergent views as to what that limit should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Carrier liability also includes the question of the Trade Practices Act, and we have long been concerned that Telecom has breached its obligations under that act not to engage in misleading and deceptive conduct in its dealings with customers with difficult network faults. We have referred our tabled documents to the Trade Practices Commission for investigation, and I understand that the minister has done so too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are particularly pleased that a new unit is to be formed within Austel to manage network performance, quality service and customer complaints arising from difficult network faults. There has been a serious communication problem between Austel and the COTs, and we trust that this unit will fix that problem. It should fill the large gap between where Austel's responsibilities end and the Telecommunication Industry Ombudsman's responsibilities begin. We note that the new unit will be headed by a general manager reporting to one of Austel's three members. We hope that the new member will be appointed soon, and that the appointment of a permanent chair will also be made soon to give Austel extra stability and certainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement includes a number of initiatives in the area of customer privacy, and they are all welcome, particularly the publication of its privacy audit and proposed new disciplinary procedures. But we regard it as essential that Austel be the ultimate auditor and the arbiter of privacy matters for all carriers, and that Telecom's initiatives are complementary to Austel's role and are not seen in any way as a substitute. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom's administration of the Freedom of Information Act has been controversial in relation to the Casualties of Telecom, and we are concerned that the changes now being implemented still may not be adequate. In our opinion, Telecom employees handling FOI applications should do that and that alone. In the case of the COTs, there should be a total separation between FOI administrators and those employees managing the arbitration process. Many of the problems that have arisen to date are the result of Telecom managers trying to encourage the COTs to seek documents through arbitration rather than through FOI, to avoid the risk of public release. This is, of course, completely inappropriate. The FOI act imposes statutory obligations which cannot be avoided in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that the Commonwealth Ombudsman has been dealing with Telecom's FOI administration for so long is a clear indication that something has been badly wrong. We are yet to be convinced that it has been put right but we will defer to the ombudsman's forthcoming report on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, and indeed everyone else involved in the Casualties of Telecom issue, would like to see the arbitration processes concluded quickly. I believe that there are two important conditions which must be met: the FOI applications of people now under arbitration must be fully delivered; and they must be given technical assistance to help construct their claims. Unlike Telecom, they do not have the expertise or resources to analyse tens of thousands of documents&mdash;and that is how many there are&mdash;in order to quantify the extent of phone faults on their service. They need help. Once those conditions have been met, I would strongly urge those in arbitration to participate fully in the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A question I am sure will be asked&mdash;it seems to be asked a lot lately&mdash;and which I will therefore answer now is: will we support a Senate inquiry into Telecom? Our aim all along has been to find solutions rather than to explore questions to which we already know the answers. Our reason for tabling the documents was to get action, and we have done that. We have also made it clear that we do not wish to inquire into matters which have already been investigated competently and thoroughly. Our emphasis is to have the results of those investigations made public, not to reinvent the wheel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already raised outstanding concerns about Telecom's handling of freedom of information applications and about the extent to which the Australian Federal Police investigations will be made public should there be no prosecutions arising. We will pursue our FOI concerns with the minister and will be guided on further action by the Commonwealth Ombudsman's report into Telecom's administration of FOI claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said before, where we take our concerns about the Federal Police report depends on how the Director of Public Prosecutions responds to it. If charges are preferred, then in keeping with convention, we will take no further action while the matter is before the courts. If no charges are preferred, we will seek further information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can see no basis at this stage for a Senate inquiry. However, we would reconsider our position if the implementation of the minister's commitments is not expedited or if there are new revelations which require closer investigation. In either event, a Senate inquiry is one possible means to an end, namely, to solve a problem; but it is not an end in itself. What matters is results. That is what we hoped to achieve out of today's statement&mdash;an accountable and responsive Telecom, a strong and independent regulator, and a world-class telecommunications system. We believe that a good start has now been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the report from Minister Lee focusing on the telecommunication network and the issue of services that affect telecommunication customers. The minister's statement sets out the government initiatives to speed up the improvements in the telecommunications sector. He wants to ensure that all Australians have access to a telephone service that is affordable and of a world-class standard. But, as we will see from some of the comments I will reveal later from the technical experts, in country areas in particular we are far from that sort of standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through this report the minister will also try to achieve a service where telephone carriers conform to the highest standards of ethical behaviour and customer service. The ministerial statement does set out actions on the Telecom network and customer issues that we support. The report does show a willingness to act on a wide range of identified problems in our telecommunications system&mdash;for example, the AFP inquiry into allegations that Telecom recorded phone calls of customers without consent has been finalised. The opposition calls on the government to make sure that this is completed as quickly as possible through the Australian Federal Police and that the investigating teams move to prosecute, if appropriate, as this issue has severely shaken public confidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulator Austel is to develop an independent capability to monitor the telecommunication carriers' compliance with mandatory performance standards, and that is welcome. The implementation by Telecom of the Austel report on Casualties of Telecom, which was referred to by the last speaker, is positive in the direction in which it is now proceeding. We welcome the report that Telecom will institute new customer complaint handling procedures as recommended by the independent consultants Coopers and Lybrand. The proposed Telecom customer charter in plain English detailing what services people can expect for their money is overdue but needed urgently, and the government's movement in this area is also welcome. The involvement of the Trade Practices Commission in the wording of the charter that the government proposes will certainly help public confidence in this document and in this procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority given to internal staff training at Telecom to get staff to own the values of the charter on customer service is essential to prevent some of the terrible situations that arose during the COT case episode. The minister's assurance on customer privacy, however, needs further scrutiny. The report of the Australian Federal Police and action by the Director of Public Prosecutions are awaited by the public and by members of this parliament with great interest. We also await the Attorney-General's amendments to the Telecommunications Interception Act to see whether it limits sufficiently the exemptions now given to carrier employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I have said that the report contains many things that are positive, in many ways it shows that Telecom has a long way to go, particularly in terms of the standard of service in certain areas of the country. The minister and indeed the head of Telecom talk about Telecom's world-class service and in many areas that is true. However, one area in which there are great difficulties is that of rural service. Given how long telephony has been operating in this country, it is amazing that some rural areas still have such an appalling level of service. Indeed, it was shown in the COT cases that most of the problems that arose occurred because of a poor technical standard of equipment in certain areas which was creating most of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the government is ignoring rural and regional Australia in terms of the adequacy of its telephony standard is very much in line with its approach in many other areas. Whether in terms of roads, rail, bridges and in this case telecommunications infrastructure, Labor's record to date is very poor. Senators will recall that the minister responsible for rural and regional affairs recently brought down a rural policy and spoke of spending $160 million over a period of four years. That is a pathetic sum of money to be spent over the whole of rural and regional Australia, particularly when one considers that `regional' as defined includes cities. The total amount to be spent next year on infrastructure under that program was $10 million across Australia, including big cities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The g<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS>overnment has a long history in this area and this most recent case of its rural and regional policies shows that sad history is continuing and that Labor is neglecting rural Australia. The case in point highlights even further that this government is neglecting the telephone system and its infrastructure in rural and regional Australia. Evidence has surfaced from internal technical documents that out there is a clapped out and, at best, second-rate network of service to country people. On top of this extraordinary drought and other areas of callous policies from this government&mdash;a government that has ignored rural Australia and the suffering that has arisen from the drought over a period of four years&mdash;farming families have to put up with a second-rate telephone system and have to pay high charges for what is delivered to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An internal Telecom document distributed by the Democrats highlights some of the damning problems with phone services to rural customers. I quote from a technical transmission group document in Telecom dated January 1994. It shows that the system contains a huge range of faults. So much for Minister Lee's lofty claims about a world-class telephone system that works. Let us defer to the Telecom technical experts for their assessment of the service to rural Australians. I quote from the document:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A selected group of staff in New South Wales south and west region (Consumer and Country Division) conducted an examination and testing process of cables feeding out of eight rural exchanges. The initial aim was to gather information about the real level of transmission-related faults. However, the findings create great concern over the degree of direct current faults.</PARA>
<PARA>That was the background to the findings and it amounts to a catalogue of disgraceful service delivery to the 93 per cent of rural households on such a telephone system in the regions. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The servicing of the network investigated is totally understaffed. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no reliable records kept of completed repairs . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faults are not being repaired at all&mdash;the service restoration method is to transpose around the problem. This applies to faults in joints as well as cable links. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a zero level of field staff understanding of transmission testing techniques and operating principles. . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Modern testing equipment although adequately supplied, is only used by a minority of staff. . .</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless a customer is within a few hundred metres of an exchange, it is impossible to find a totally fault-free spare twisted copper pair to use. . </PARA>
<PARA>The document outlines poor standards of work that cause disruption to customer service. It instances long delays in fault repair work; deficiencies in the side tone level and quality of the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that these deficiencies are contained in an internal Telecom report, we demand that the minister should take this seriously. Let us have no airy, fancy words such as world-class service when one is facing a damning internal document of Telecom that reveals the real state of the system. Rural Australia is tired of such very poor treatment by what is supposed to be a highly competent technical company. Clearly Austel, the referee in telecommunications, needs to monitor much more closely the performance standards of Telecom in the bush. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today at lunchtime I made a speech on the information superhighway&mdash;one of a series that I am doing. We were speaking of the roll-out of this sort of communication technology right across Australia to link this country into the rest of the world. What hope has rural and regional Australia to be linked into a high capacity, high quality world-wide system when after 60 years of telephony there is now such a poor standard of service in rural areas? In the United States there is talk of the information rich and the information poor in the new information age. If our rural and regional areas are so poorly connected to the information superhighway, people in those areas will certainly be part of the information poor. I call on the government to act on Telecom's own internal report showing the faults in the telephony system and to fix them immediately. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my earlier remarks on the motion to set up a Senate select committee of inquiry into the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, I referred to my experience on the Senate Select Committee on Public Interest Whistleblowing. I learned many valuable lessons from service on that committee, three of which are relevant at this time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first lesson I learned was the importance of media to those people who are concerned about fraud or corrupt conduct within institutions, in government or in the public or private sector bureaucracies. The media and its presence as a last resort is very valuable to those people who have no other avenues open to them. The fact that people who make complaints in the public interest need appropriate mechanisms for expressing concerns when there is an error in the system was a matter addressed by the select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It noted that the absence of those factors meant that the media operated often as a last resort&mdash;sometimes as the only avenue of expressing concerns. Had these been dealt with earlier and in a more constructive manner by the institutions about which those complaints were being made, it would have been far better.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing I learnt was that, while media did have at certain times a very useful function for those people who were expressing concerns and allegations, when problems arose within the media itself, often those people had nowhere to turn. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to a particular section of the whistleblower report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">In the Public Interest</EMPHASIS>. In section 9.129, the committee discussed whistleblowing to the media and moved on. The committee received evidence which indicated concerns over whistleblowing within the media and the reaction to disclosures of wrongdoing involving the media. Witnesses referred to unscrupulous activities going on within the media, examples of media manipulation and the important role the media played in government and ministerial accountability. The committee reports states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee makes no judgment as to the comments received in evidence, but is concerned at the lack of response to this Inquiry from the media. The Committee believes that further parliamentary scrutiny of this area could be warranted. The Committee is concerned that if the media is not open and accountable itself then the openness and accountability of government could be jeopardised.</PARA>
<PARA>There is an intelligence test question that asks: what is the importance of a free press to a nation? I leave that question in the air because I believe that that is one of the principles underlying the basis for having a method of scrutiny for problems within the media itself which are not apparently being currently addressed through other systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third lesson I learnt from my involvement in that committee was how valuable, positive and constructive a Senate select committee can be and that it can actually present a very helpful and positive approach to complex, sensitive and seemingly insoluble difficulties. It was a cross-party committee. It had a unanimous report, but it was the first committee where I have actually seen the role of parliament as mediator between the people and bureaucratic systems of all different kinds, whether they are government, private or public sector organisations. Because of that, I believe it is valuable to make this reference regarding the ABC to a Senate select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have foreshadowed some amendments and, while I may not have seen all of them, I can certainly say that the Greens support the ones that I have seen. I am willing to support the modifications to the reference as it has been placed. I will leave it up to the opposition to express its views, but I feel it is extremely constructive to have a cross-party analysis of these issues. I welcome the Australian Democrats' support, and I believe it will add to the depth of the inquiry and will make sure that what we are trying to do is not only perceived to be fair and open but will be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centralisation of operations towards Sydney within the ABC, the proposal to amalgamate Radio Australia and ATV that was mooted and the increasing commercialisation of the broadcaster has brought to a head concern over the ABC. This is because the ABC represents the only alternative to commercial media in Australia. We believe the ABC needs to preserve its unique position as the national public broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The broad terms of reference of the committee mean that a wide range of submissions will be considered from the community and people more closely connected with the broadcaster. Senate committees can take evidence in closed hearings, which will mean that persons will be able to appear before the committee without fear or favour. There must be a visible mechanism for the ABC to get over these problems rather than glossing over them. The purpose of the inquiry is not to emphasise any one of the particular issues but to be a wide-ranging inquiry, ensuring that nothing holds the ABC back from continuing its vital role in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats will support this motion. We have asked people to consider a couple of amendments, as Senator Chamarette mentioned. The main one is that we are concerned, as has always been the case, with the adequacy of funding of the ABC. It appears to us that over the last few years the ABC has been given additional charter obligations through legislation in general and it has been given one-off grants to fulfil those obligations. After that grant runs out its service has to be self-funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are just not sure that that is the way we ought to be going with our national broadcaster. If we want to have a quality service, it seems reasonable to us that we pay for that quality service. If the Australian people as a nation want to have a quality service such as Australia Television, then we ought to be prepared to pay for that. We ought to think that the benefits of having it mean that it is worth while paying our tax dollars towards a good service. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had considerable qualms about the controversy surrounding appointments to the board of the ABC, and we have made them known. We do not necessarily think that the board has been politicised to an extent that it becomes not as unbiased as we would hope, but we would like to have a look at it and assure ourselves and the Australian public that that is not the case, if it is not the case. So I think it is worth while having a look into that aspect especially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette has agreed, and I think Senator Alston and the government have also agreed, that it would be sensible to look into the matters which are being looked into by Mr George Palmer QC after he has reported and see if there is something we can reasonably add to those recommendations. So we recommend, hope and expect that the recommendations would be accepted and that we do not go into that section of this inquiry until that has happened. We think it probably will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other two amendments I would like to move are less important, but I think they make the process more democratic. I do not think that there necessarily should be an opposition chair of select committees. It is more reasonable, as far as we are concerned, to take the chair from the members of the committee as those members decide. That way, in the end, we will end up with what has been agreed. In the past&mdash;I think it was in May last year&mdash;we agreed that we would try to distribute chairs of select committees roughly according to the proportion of parties and members of this Senate. I think we have done that pretty well up until now, and I wish to continue to do that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the coalition also strongly supports this proposal for the establishment of a select committee on ABC management and operations. Although it has been long in coming, we certainly welcome the initiative that has been taken today. I trust that the proposal will receive the support of the Senate and that this inquiry is established. It is certainly time that our national broadcaster was made more accountable to the people of Australia and I trust that the inquiry on which we are about to embark will achieve that end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent months we have seen a growing public concern about the growth in the influence of the government over the direction and charter of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation with the undoubted aim of gaining political advantage. That is reflected in a number of recent appointments to the board of the ABC&mdash;most notably that of the former South Australian Labor premier, John Bannon, but also that of Wendy Silver from Western Australia and others&mdash;such that we now find that the board of the ABC has a majority of people on it with close and clearly identifiable links with the Labor Party. It is undoubtedly through that mechanism that this government is seeking to impose its influence upon the national broadcaster and that is directly contrary to the principles of independence and impartiality which we have long expected of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the concern is not only with the political influence that has been brought to bear through those board appointments; the actual appropriateness of the appointments needs to be brought into question. As we have said in earlier debates in this place with regard to the constitution of the board of the ABC, the former Labor premier, Mr Bannon, took South Australia into financial oblivion with his involvement in the creation of a massive $3 billion debt which is now being shouldered by every South Australian. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it has to do with it is the appropriateness of this government appointing to the board people of demonstrable incompetence. I trust that this inquiry will look at those matters very closely and will look at the way in which this government has stacked the board with its mates to its own attempted advantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is no wonder that the government is opposing this inquiry. It fears that the truth about those issues will come out. It fears that the truth about the continuing high level of resignations and departures from the ABC of senior, experienced broadcasting managers and cancellation of programs will also be uncovered by this inquiry. It obviously fears that further evidence may become public about the ABC's suspected involvement in breaches of sponsorship rules involving co-production. It fears that it might be implicated in allowing the huge wastage of public funds from the ABC's failed commercial activities to go unaccounted for. There is no doubt that the government would be opposing the establishment of a Senate inquiry by way of a select committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC is a very vital part of our democratic community. The success that it has achieved in the past is due to the fact that it was always seen to be at arm's length from the government of the day. The reason the public is rapidly losing confidence in our national broadcaster, the reason we daily read in the newspapers, see on television news reports and current affairs programs and hear on the radio about the internal fighting and lack of morale in the ABC, and the reason so much abuse and misuse of taxpayers' funds is occurring in the ABC is that the government and the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) have not been accountable to the public for their actions with regard to the national broadcaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I trust that this inquiry will ensure that the government, in particular the minister and, indeed, the ABC itself will again be made accountable to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian community. We need to ensure that our national broadcaster is given every opportunity to function properly without political interference or political hindrance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, as I said at the outset, I welcome this proposal for a Senate select committee to inquire into the ABC with the terms of reference that have been proffered.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise to oppose the proposition for the establishment of a select committee on ABC management and operations. I realise that some opposite have a fascination with the media, as reflected in the comments made routinely by the coalition about the ABC in particular and the media generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen through the workings of the print media committee just how a select committee can run off the rails very early never to return. We have also seen the voracious appetite for public dollars generated by the Senate print media committee, on which both Senator Sherry and I had the unhappy task of serving. We were initially promised that it would be concluded by the early part of this year&mdash;by the end of February, if I remember correctly. We have now seen efforts to extend it to March of 1995. I now confidently predict that we will not see the end of it then; it will run the length and life of this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The creation of a Senate select committee should be the basis for a contribution to public policy and a sense of perspective. But the essential precondition for creating a select committee that is going to work in that way&mdash;I do not doubt Senator Chamarette's spirit when she says that she would like to see this committee work in that way&mdash;is to approach matters in an objective manner and to endeavour to establish goodwill and a sense of trust all around the chamber from the moment the committee is created. That was not the case with the print media committee; the well was poisoned at the commencement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The well has been poisoned at the commencement again because if we look at the mechanism by which the committee is created&mdash;if I am reading the proposition correctly&mdash;there would be two senators from the government, three from the opposition, one from the Democrats and one from the Greens (WA) or Senator Harradine. Circumstances being what they are, Ferdinand Marcos would have loved a system like that when it is looked at in terms of proportional representation. This is not only stacking the constituency, this is fixing the outcome as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A select committee is tarnished at its inception by that mechanism. So I really think we are not going to see a sense of perspective emerge on the basis that the committee will not be seen to be fair, impartial or objective at the time at which it is created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some serious matters before the national broadcaster. I do not think that anyone would disagree with that. I think the Palmer inquiry is welcome. I have a very high regard for Mr Palmer and I have no doubt that his report will be beneficial to the corporation and for broadcasting policy. But to be honest, I grow a little tired of the crocodile tears opposite, accompanied on some occasions and replaced on others by endless assaults on the ABC from the conservative parties. In a number of respects, the ABC is doing well as a national broadcaster with the amount of Australian drama and public affairs programs going to air, its innovation and international outlook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge the contribution of Mr David Hill in that regard. He has brought significant and substantive changes to the broadcaster. I think that by and large the ABC's public affairs program is reliable, its news service is fair and objective and its analysis is informative. I acknowledge one program in particular&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS>. That is not to say that from time to time I have not disagreed with things that have been said, reports that have gone to air, and so on. I think we all face that from time to time. But, by and large, I think the ABC does a very effective job, not only in the capital cities but also in the regions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate decides to proceed down this path on the basis of a statutory declaration&mdash;frankly, I really cannot see why the government should participate in some of these bodies&mdash;all it will have achieved at the outset is to demonstrate the latent hostility that exists in this chamber towards the Labor government in the broad. We have seen that on different occasions and it might be part of the political process if it ever bore a result, if it ever achieved anything. But if the people opposite think this is going to lift their prospects for 1995-96, they are sadly mistaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the fiasco of the print media committee again. No-one benefited from that; certainly public policy did not. The imbalance in the committee underlines the problem. There is a lack of equity that confirms the assessment which I am making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I doubt that this initiative could be more ill-timed or that it could be based on a lesser premise. For example, only yesterday the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) tabled in the House of Representatives a report on the inquiry into financial and managerial aspects of the ABC's Australia Television service. It is simply a matter of public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That report, which was commissioned by the minister in response to allegations that this service is running funds within the ABC, found that support of the service by the ABC has not involved diversion of resources from budget funded activities. This is again a simple matter of fact. The minister wrote to the chairman of the board in relation to a number of issues raised by the report, matters which are being addressed by the board in conjunction with management. Surely that ought to be the first option. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, the minister has publicly indicated that he will be continuing to work with the ABC in developing the Australia international service, a service that is acknowledged as making a significant contribution to promoting Australia in the region, something that, from memory, Senator Bourne and I saw first hand on our recent travels in the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ludicrous for the Senate to embark upon another inquiry into this service. All it will be is a forum for grandstanding. I make that prediction with absolute certainty. Senator Bourne made her usual thoughtful contribution and expressed the view that she hoped quite honestly and earnestly that this would not occur. I fear the absolute worst, given the absolute obsession with media opposite and the personalities who are going to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the circumstances of Senator Alston's recent remarks to Mr Oakes on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday</EMPHASIS> program. He talked about pay TV involving `wishful thinking.' Going back to June of 1992, from memory, we should rhetorically ask who it was that insisted on the ABC embarking upon the pay television initiative? Was there not an amendment moved by Senator Alston in this chamber? Was there not a proposal that emerged from the same Senator Alston? Now he is talking about people with the deepest pockets in television as competitors. Now he is talking about the ABC's `wishful thinking.' This is the pirouette off the top diving board; there is no question about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette referred to cross-party support. Cross-party support ought to extend around the chamber. There are enough committees that work well in this place&mdash;joint, standing and select&mdash;to demonstrate that that can be achieved fairly readily. As I said, it is an essential precondition for a select committee that it work. If it is not perceived as fair or as being able to make a thoughtful contribution to public policy, it simply will not work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the inquiries that are under way, that are ongoing, the ABC, or separately the government, has instituted the Australia Television review, an independent inquiry by a senior Sydney barrister into the sponsorship matters, which I mentioned earlier, and detailed discussions between the board, the minister and the Department of Communications and the Arts to establish a rigorous and transparent framework for the ABC's involvement in pay television. So on the public record the government's bona fides are established. Little will be achieved by this initiative, which is a pity. Select committees are becoming Confederate currency&mdash;absolutely worthless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To listen to the weasel words opposite that the ABC should be the fearless and independent broadcaster&mdash;at the margin as always, at the periphery as always&mdash;will not convince anyone on this side of the chamber or in the electorate at large that there is anything other than a political agenda inherent in what the coalition is doing with this proposition. If people wait to make a judgment on how this committee works, on what its report will contain and on what its findings will be, they will see my words borne out in several months time. In several months time we will see the emergence of a political agenda and political objectives being achieved by the coalition making findings on which it has already agreed, circumstances being what they are. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry into the ABC will achieve nothing more than to waste public money, take up the time of the Senate and further discredit the select committee system. It will serve nobody's ends except those of the opportunists opposite, who wanted to take $50 million out of the ABC's budget prior to the 1993 election, codified it in Fightback and told the ABC management it was an immutable commitment&mdash;I think those were Mr Carlton's words. They are the same people who are now saying that the fearlessness and independence of the broadcaster ought to be guaranteed. This committee will not do it. This committee will do nothing other than guarantee that there will be a series of political arguments raging over the months and a report which will mean nothing to broadcasting policy. </PARA>

That is really what he is complaining about. There is no hidden agenda here. The areas of concern are transparent. They have been specified.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For our part, we are very much committed to the ABC. It ought to be a quality alternative to the commercial broadcasting sector.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the areas that have been specified in this motion, I would have thought there is a very important public issue surrounding the future of both ATVI on the one hand and pay television on the other. I do not hold the view that the ABC should not be in any commercial activities, but I do hold the view that, if we look at the way in which the BBC has approached the matter, we will see that there are ways in which commercial activities can be quarantined, the costs of those programs can be separated out and it can be ensured that there is not a high degree of cross-subsidy. We cannot say that about the ABC at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only a couple of weeks ago I was interested to discover the extent to which the ABC was funding a service called BNA, Broadcast News Australia, which has recently decided to go into competition with AAP, a news wire service which has been a monopoly activity in the private sector for 50 years or more. If we try to find out the extent of the ABC's commitment, we can barely find mention of the service in the annual report. In other words, it is very unclear to what extent ABC resources are being devoted to what seems to me to be a speculative commercial venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same goes for ATVI. I have always thought that there was a great deal to be said for Australia having an international satellite service that is able to ensure that our culture is readily available to those in the region, not just expats but the very many hundreds of millions of people who are potential viewers of a service. But it is not an easy exercise. It has already proven to be a very difficult matter to estimate the extent to which there will be a take-up. There does not seem to be any serious research done on the matter. Indeed, there have been suggestions that the ABC does not particularly want to conduct research, because it will show that the level of sponsorship is such that it reflects the fact that there is a very poor level of audience participation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have been told in the Hutchinson report is that for 1993-94 sponsorship raised $900,000, as against a projected figure of, I think, $2.6 million or $2.9 million. So it has been dramatically behind target in the last financial year. It also says that in the current financial year, which is only a few months old, it is well ahead of target. But again one has to rely on these sorts of figures emerging as a result of an inquiry of that sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought the idea that the ABC can be a successful international satellite operator by simply investing $5.4 million is drawing a very long bow. I am not at all satisfied that that amount is sufficient. I have a pretty good idea how it came about: there were those in cabinet who were not in favour of any involvement at all and there were those who were&mdash;as I recall, Senator Evans and Senator Collins were two in favour&mdash;and the compromise was that $5.4 million would be given on a one-off basis. The ABC was supposed to be self-funding. We now find from the Hutchinson report that what self-funding means to the ABC is quite different from what it means to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, the idea of being able to run a fully fledged service for that sort of money is asking people to make some very heroic assumptions. The same goes for a pay service costing $12.5 million. That seems to me to be a pitifully small amount if one is serious about competing against others in the international arena. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Loosley, I presume, was just reciting an answer that Mr Lee gave in the House of Representatives yesterday, but the facts are that the government and the Australian Democrats had agreed that the ABC would have two channels. The only amendment I moved was in relation to giving the ABC a separate transponder&mdash;well and truly after that commitment had been made, after it was locked in, after the numbers were there and after the ABC was well and truly provided for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that we disagreed with it. Indeed, I think the announcement of $12.5 million was made at the time. But that has got nothing to do with assessing progress two years down the track, and nothing to do with taking account of all the other commitments that have subsequently been entered into. That is why I think it is in everyone's best interests to investigate these matters in as impartial a manner as possible. I do not take the approach that Senator Loosley takes, which is to take no prisoners, basically, and that anyone who disagrees with the Labor Party is by definition grandstanding, by definition has a hidden agenda, and by definition is not committed. The corollary of that, of course, is that those on the government side have no hidden agenda, they are not in the business of grandstanding, they are entirely dedicated to the public interest and they are simply trying to achieve the best for all concerned. </PARA>

When a motion is put forward in this way that has multi-party support and which does address a number of major issues of concern&mdash;I think even Senator Loosley conceded in passing that a number of these matters were validly in the public arena&mdash;I would have thought that there was an obligation on us all to take those issues seriously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it can be done in a select committee process. I believe that there are a lot of people of goodwill towards the ABC who would be prepared to contribute by way of submissions and evidence, and that as a result the ABC would be a lot better and stronger for the process. It is not a matter of wasting resources. I have to say that I do not think that the Palmer inquiry is much more than an exercise in damage control. It is addressing a very important issue, but all it does is ask whether the guidelines have been breached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that we need to know why they have been breached, we need to know the implications, and we need to know how it came about. Given that the guidelines require the Director of Radio and the Director of Television to satisfy themselves on a whole number of counts, they clearly, therefore, ought to have asked questions about what funds were provided by co-producers or financiers of co-producers, on what terms, and what limitations there might have been on editorial control. In other words, a whole range of questions are required to be asked so that the director can satisfy himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the first question to answer is whether the director carried out his obligations under the guidelines. If he did, was he then misled by those who simply said that there were no monies being paid indirectly, that there was not any editorial interference? Or, on the other hand, did he simply ignore those matters, even though they were brought to his attention in advance? To merely ask `whether' is in no way an adequate response to the allegations that have been raised. We need to know why, we need to know the circumstances and the background and, best of all, we need to know the implications and what ought to be done to ensure that problems do not arise in that area in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All I can say is that the Palmer exercise is very narrowly based. The view we have taken, I think quite rightly, is that the Senate committee should not embark upon an examination of that particular term of reference until the Palmer report is to hand, and I understand that is to be November.

I would hope that it is immediately put before the select committee so that it can then look at how far Palmer has managed to get and then take the matter further if necessary. As I have said, having looked at the terms of reference, I think that inevitably there is a lot more to be said about the whole area of co-production than will ever be brought to light by Mr Palmer's inquiry. That is no reflection on him; it is simply a reflection on the very narrow terms of reference which were probably the classic knee-jerk response to a television program. That is not the way to approach the very serious issue of the future of the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not pretend for a moment that there will not be political skirmishes; but we on our side of the chamber are very much committed to the ABC's emerging from this exercise in a stronger position, with a much clearer sense of what its charter obligations ought to be and with the public having a much greater degree of confidence that the ABC is able to cope with all the obligations it has taken upon itself, particularly in the commercial arena.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are two sets of reasons why the government is opposed to the establishment of this committee. The first set of reasons relates to the ongoing, and unfortunately growing, abuse of Senate select committees. The other set of reasons has to do with the way in which policy analysis and what may be some valid criticisms of the ABC should be scrutinised and handled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start with, I will deal with the ongoing abuse of Senate select committees. I do not know whether it is coincidence, but on at least one of the last three Senate select committees that I have been on I have shared that privilege with Senator Alston. The first was the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It was not just because I was chair or Senator Alston was deputy chair of the committee that it was generally accepted that the committee developed policy recommendations in a fairly objective and bipartisan way. It has a fairly substantial record, not just under the initial appointments to that committee but also more recently under the chair of Senator Watson who is an opposition senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then moved on to what has now become known as the infamous loan council committee, the Senate Select Committee on the Australian Loan Council. That was the first indication to me that select committees were being established for political grandstanding and were failing to meet any sort of test of objectivity. I do not intend to relate all the circumstances we had on that committee. It was set up just prior to the last election. It increased its tempo of meetings as the election was called. There were meetings in airport terminals and we issued an interim report with under half&mdash;</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Alston" NAMEID="LD4">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am just about to get to the hospital bed interview that Senator Alston did. An interim report was issued with only half the evidence heard. This was all done because Senator Coulter wanted to build his profile during the election campaign&mdash;and we know what happened. Senator Alston did a famous interview from his hospital bed, because he had to participate in the meeting, and we did a phone vote. To this day, we do not know whether phone votes are legal; but it occurred. We had meetings called on and off; we had majority reports turning into minorities the next day. It became a total farce.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then had another select committee, the media committee. That is still going; it will go for another six months because we are waiting for a response to a government report. Senator Alston obviously will be paid in the meantime, but we are not sure what the committee is going to do, other than wait for this report from the government. The media committee had an unfortunate series of events as well. We had Senator Kernot making some comments about wanting to put public servants in gaol. We had assurances that there would be objectivity, that there would be clear policy analysis, that there would not be grandstanding. But, unfortunately, the loans council committee and the media committee certainly indicate that the recent trend of Senate select committees is towards nothing more than political grandstanding and point scoring. They are not for the legitimate development of balanced policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we have another Senate committee proposed. I was in the chamber yesterday when the motion was tabled. I might say I was appalled for a number of reasons. Firstly, when we look through the terms of reference, we see that they are written in a totally negative way. They are not terms of reference that make legitimate, clear points of inquiry. For example, the first term of reference, subclause (a), says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the failure of Australian Television International to penetrate its target markets in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a presumption before the inquiry commences. Terms of reference should not be written in this way. Let us flick over to the next couple of pages and look at the government membership of the committee. Again, I am appalled. It is a seven-person committee but how many members does the government get? It gets two out of seven. With every select committee that is set up the government is ending up with fewer and fewer members. We used to get the chairs&mdash;now there is a legitimate case for the government not getting the chair on every occasion. But we are down to two out of seven members. One of the arguments for rotating chairs was the proportional nature of this chamber. Well, two out of seven is much less than the proportion the government represents in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another interesting aspect of this motion which was tabled yesterday is that that was the first time the government saw the motion. We expect a bipartisan approach and a thorough policy analysis in a balanced way. Government members are expected to approach their duties in a responsible fashion but they are not even consulted about the terms of reference. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We may; but we were not even asked. The terms of reference are set up in a negative way with totally unbalanced representation on the committee membership&mdash;and we are not even asked. With that sort of approach, I do not think it is reasonable to expect the sort of cooperation that those opposite could otherwise expect. It is a great way to start off a committee inquiry: not to consult with the government about any of the terms of reference or the membership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another reason this committee should not be set up is that we have just been through a fairly lengthy set of negotiations about reorganising our standing, legislative and estimates committees in this place. On a number of occasions I can recall not just opposition members but members from the Greens and the Australian Democrats arguing that we should have a more balanced approach to committee membership in terms of representation&mdash;sharing out committee chairs&mdash;and there are far too many select committees. They said that if we reform the committee structure, rather than setting up select committees on an ongoing basis&mdash;there have been more and more of them in recent years&mdash;we can look much more favourably on referring these types of references to the standing committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what do we get? Shortly after we get agreement on this new committee system for the Senate&mdash;which has not even been tested and is not operational&mdash;we get the creation of another Senate select committee, rather than having this matter referred to the appropriate standing committee. I have to say that it could not be surprising to people listening or to other senators in this chamber that the government is a little concerned about this approach and rejects the approach that has been adopted in this case. Senator Loosley touched on other policy reasons as to why it is not appropriate for a Senate select committee to be established in the terms that have been outlined: to investigate various aspects of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe in taking up the Senate's time by duplicating debate, but there is one issue I want to conclude on. Senator Chapman made a contribution to this debate and made an allegation that there had been funding cuts to the ABC in recent years. I hope Senator Chapman is put on this committee because he might learn some facts. There have been no funding cuts to the ABC in recent years. I do not know how Senator Chapman can come in here and make these bald assertions that are just totally incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1988, the ABC has received guaranteed funding under the triennial funding arrangements. In the last budget the government agreed to maintain existing levels of funding for a further three years with a full adjustment for inflation. This advantage allows the ABC to plan for the future with a higher degree of certainty, and it is an indication of the importance which the government attaches to the ABC. So I hope Senator Chapman, if he is going to sit on yet another select committee, learns something at least about the funding of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Contrast our commitment to the ABC in the funding area with the lack of commitment from the coalition. Indeed, one of the coalition members paid the ultimate price at the last election. Warwick Smith, the former member for Bass in the other place, lost his seat because of the opposition's commitment in Fightback to slash the funding of ABC by 10 per cent. He lost his seat of Bass by 41 or 42 votes. That was one of the three local issues that led to his defeat. So the opposition should be warned. The opposition has attempted to play games with the ABC in a variety of ways and it has not done it any good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite want to set up yet another select committee, they want to trip around the country looking into these issues, but it will do them no political good. The opposition thought the select committee into the loans council would bring down the Treasurer at the time; that it would bring down the government; and that it would be very embarrassing to the government. Frankly, all it did was make the previous leader of the Democrats look a fool and wasted a lot of time of opposition members in the election campaign when they should have been out there defending their policy positions instead of wasting their time in airport lounges trying to get the majority when they could not count or could not get out of bed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have just been through another select committee into foreign ownership of the media. What has that accomplished? Very little. If the opposition's objective is to get on this side of the Senate chamber, it had better start identifying the real policy issues and the real approach to getting into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is little wonder that the public treats the opposition with contempt. There is absolutely no respect for the opposition in the community. I am worried about that because governments need effective oppositions rather than the rabble and the shambles we have opposite. Even to the degree where those opposite attempt to produce some sort of policy direction&mdash;we cannot use the word `policy'; the opposition does not dare talk about policy. It does not want to have any policy. It produced some sort of document a couple of weeks ago; everyone has now forgotten the name of it, and it is an embarrassment to the opposition when people refer to the name of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite are an absolute shambles. They come up with propositions like this. By all means, they can go off, have their hearings and trip around the country. At the end of the day, in the sense of it developing good public policy, unfortunately it will not happen. We have seen the approach that has been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bourne and Senator Chamarette are very naive in their approach to this issue. The evidence has very clearly been that this is yet another disruption tactic by the opposition. If opposition senators want to waste their own time, so be it. Unfortunately, they are going to waste a lot more money. I do not know what the cost of the last couple of select committees has been. It would be in the vicinity of hundreds of thousands of dollars each. As well as that, those opposite will waste considerable time and, I am sure, significant financial resources of the ABC. For that reason and the reasons that Senator Loosley has outlined, this motion should be rejected. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to oppose this ill-conceived motion. Senator Chamarette has put forward several assertions about the ABC as justification for an inquiry. She has claimed that the Australian Television International network has failed to penetrate into Asian markets and is therefore `a waste of scarce resources'. She has referred to recent media speculation about inappropriate sponsorship. She has commented on the supposed low morale of the ABC staff. She has suggested that there is public concern about the future of the corporation. These claims are unfounded. Much as the opposition and the Greens would like to create an atmosphere of uncertainty about the ABC, the fact is that the corporation has never been stronger and its future never brighter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette asserts that the activities of the Australian Television International network have been a failure in penetrating Asian markets. The reality is somewhat different. ATV is still in its formative stage. It has already played a vital role in strengthening our links with Asia. It has given many Asian nations an opportunity to discover that there is more to Australia than just tourism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian Television International allows us to project a very positive profile of Australia into South-East Asia and provides corporate Australia with an unparalleled opportunity to market its goods, exports and activities. It is assisting the production of foreign language programs in Asia and has provided another avenue for Australia to sell itself as a commercial centre in the South-East Asian community. It broadcasts for 16 hours a day to 15 Asian nations, emphasising quality Australian and regional programs. Over the rest of this year there is a commitment that ATV will extend its new content to 30 per cent of total broadcast time, an essential service for many of our neighbours whose internal new services are poorly developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The achievements of Australian Television International in Asia are widely recognised. The former Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kwan Yew, said of the Australian media in April at the National Press Club:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only a few, like the Financial Review, the Australian, the Melbourne Age, the Sydney Morning Herald and Australian Television International provide intelligent coverage of Asia.</PARA>
<PARA>His sentiments have been echoed by other Asian leaders. The sole evidence relied upon by Senator Chamarette for the purported failure of ATV is the overrun of costs in the 1993-94 financial year. The government has already moved to deal with the problem of this budget overrun. Yesterday the Minister for Communications and the Arts, Mr Lee, tabled a report prepared by two senior officers of his department which clearly assessed the operational future of ATV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report spelt out the reasons for this accrued deficit. The report found that the costs were associated with the start-up of operations. ATV has been forced to cover an unforecastable 275 per cent jump in the cost of transponder hire to carry the signal to Asia. It has also had to meet the one-off capital costs of facilities in Darwin. The report found that by 1995-96 ATV would break even and would be able to repay its line of credit by the financial year 1999-2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATV has played a valuable role in promoting Australia in the region. The minister sought an assurance that the service provided by ATV will not detract from the quality of services provided to Australian patrons of the ABC network and has subsequently expressed his confidence in the abilities of the ABC's directing manager, Mr Hill, to carry out this commitment. On this ground, therefore, there is no need for the Senate to rush into yet another expensive inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette might like to reflect on the costs of setting up another committee and whether her motion will `waste scarce resources' that could have gone into more productive services for the community. Essentially, the problem has been identified, the reasons for it analysed and the solutions set in train. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABC operates within considerable financial restraints. Every effort is made to maximise the value received for every dollar of public funding as well as money received from other sources. This private money is sought and obtained under very strict guidelines and is required to be solicited in a manner which maintains the ABC's integrity as a public broadcaster. But the fact is that this source of funds is essential for the ABC to be able to provide the services that it does provide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, allegations have surfaced regarding possibly inappropriate sponsorship of ABC programs. The investigation of these allegations is fundamental to maintaining public confidence in the ABC and its operations. The ABC board has moved swiftly to deal with the claims. An independent investigation has been set up, headed by the respected barrister George Palmer QC. I have confidence in Mr Palmer's ability to conduct this matter. As the parliament, we should allow Mr Palmer to conduct his investigation without undue interference or media hype. I note that Senator Harradine has indicated his willingness to wait for the outcome of this inquiry before pursuing a parliamentary option. The Greens should perhaps take a leaf out of his book because, once again, the claim for the need for this Senate inquiry is being dealt with by Mr Palmer's inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Chamarette to consider the effect on staff morale of yet another inquiry into the activities of the ABC. The schoolboy behaviour of senators opposite has not helped to raise the spirits of ABC staff, who could be excused for feeling that Senator Alston would like to see them all sacked. I ask Senator Chamarette to see the foolishness of holding a morale-sapping inquiry into whether morale is low and whether it is declining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chamarette must consider whether the thrust of her motion is really about improving ABC services or whether it is about giving the Greens and the opposition greater media exposure. Senator Chamarette must be aware that an inquisition into the ABC would be another media circus&mdash;that is, a media circus with Senator Alston as the ringmaster. This might be great entertainment, but the sad thing is that this entertainment will be funded by the public purse. None of the grounds for Senator Chamarette's motion can stand up to scrutiny. This motion, cobbled together and labelled `urgent'  by the master tacticians in the Greens' office, will serve no purpose except to denigrate the role of the ABC in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that the ABC provides a quality source of information, news and mainstream culture to a broad section of the Australian community. All senators will be familiar with the quality programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Foreign Correspondent</EMPHASIS>. The ABC has expanded its network of overseas reporters in places such as Johannesburg, Moscow, Nairobi and Berlin. It has increased by 2 1/2 times the Australian production of quality drama, the most expensive television programs, with award winning programs such as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Phoenix</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Police Rescue</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Brides of Christ</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

Against the backdrop of imported programs and second-rate infotainment of the commercial networks, the ABC is able to offer a high standard of programming and education for Australians. There is no question that the ABC is a major player in creating a national identity across a country bigger than the European Union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This role is not encouraged by the coalition.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was proposed in a climate in which the ABC has even greater demand for services than it has before. Senator Alston justified his budget slashing scheme by saying that there was too much administrative waste in the public sector; yet today we have Senator Alston supporting the setting up of another inquisition which would take public money away from service provision and feed another circus of an inquisition. I note the agreement reached this morning and that an amendment has been put forward to take away the automatic right for the opposition to elect the chair of this committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today, we had a package brought down by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins). It was called `A statement by the Prime Minister, the Honourable P.J. Keating, MP&mdash;drought assistance'. It would be quite churlish not to say that the package is welcome. At long last this government has realised that people are hurting and that more has to be done than was done in the past. The package picks up many of the coalition's proposals contained in its drought policy paper of a fortnight ago. That is the most impressive part about it. The NFF has come out strongly in favour of the government package. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has said that he consulted widely in the formulation of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government cannot have everything and I do not believe that this alleviation of the RAS can have everything in it, either. I heard the minister's arguments today in dismissing a fodder subsidy scheme. I maintain that there are no incentives in the package to protect the national herd and flock. It is in the best interests of Australia to maintain the national herd and flock; to protect our ability to meet our overseas trade obligations in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has just provided a multi-million dollar handout to ANL in the national interest. Sheep and cattle breeding numbers are also in the national interest. I cannot see where today's package is going to ensure that we keep the breeding herd and the breeding flock intact so that when the drought breaks we are able to meet our obligations regarding our export of beef, lamb and wool&mdash;and as was said earlier today, wool is increasing in price and is obviously in demand around the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The release of the package today raises a number of questions that need to be addressed. The eligibility criteria for exceptional circumstances has been widely condemned as being too narrow in excluding those it is theoretically designed to help. I ask: have the criteria changed? How are the criteria going to be administered to make sure that people do not fall through the safety net? The RAS, as it is being administered at the moment, requires people to be able to show that by borrowing extra money they can increase productivity and increase their ability to survive an horrific drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had inquiries from all over Australia concerning the rural adjustment scheme and there has been a lot of misunderstanding. Has that been fixed? Tomorrow in this place I will be looking for the minister to tell us in finer detail what is happening there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his statement the Prime Minister said that the government did not want to give tax breaks; it wanted to give an incentive for people to make sure that they can solve their problems. The government does not talk about the taxes imposed on Australian farmers when Mr Keating was the Treasurer and since he has been the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister claimed that it is better to provide investment allowances rather than tax breaks on the basis that farmers are not paying taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, farmers are still slugged with fuel taxes, fringe benefits taxes, capital gains taxes and wholesale taxes, which have not been alleviated by today's announcement. They are still there. The fringe benefits tax is still causing pain to people in the Northern Territory and elsewhere. The classic example is the one we were given during the inquiry: it was costing $40-odd extra a week for supplying food and a bit of a gum branch over somebody on a mustering camp. There is something for the government to address there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not slamming the package, but the government has a lot more to answer for before it gets things right. Will today's package expand rural debt or not? Everywhere we went on the inquiry people did not want to borrow more money; people wanted help to get out of the hole they are in. If the package expands rural debt, does that not fly in the face of farmers who have said that they do not want to take out any more loans? Does it? I think the minister has to answer some of those questions tomorrow&mdash;and I am quite sure he will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said, `We are going to talk with the banks'. What is going to happen? One of the complaints that we had from all around rural Australia was that a lot of this aid goes direct to the banks and not to the farmers&mdash;they do not even see it. This is not going to lift the morale of farmers unless that matter is clarified by the minister tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government admits that the biggest beneficiaries of the package will be the lending institutions. Yet it is those very institutions with their interest charges that have been the catalyst for the financial ruin of farmers. Will the government try to ensure that future packages give good long-term loans to the rural community? How seriously did the government look at debt write-off for accumulated interest? In this package did the government look at setting aside debt and interest payments for a certain period&mdash;not writing it off but just setting it aside so that farmers could actually see a bit of light at the end of the tunnel? Given that the banks and the pastoral houses will be the big winners, is there or has there been a trade-off with some accumulated interest debt? Those are the questions that everyone is asking today about this drought package. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought package is welcome because at long last the Prime Minister has got out to look at what is happening. We have been arguing in this place now for quite some time that something had to be done to stop the decay in the rural communities because of this horrific drought. Remember the first statement by the Prime Minister that drought is a naturally occurring phenomenon in Australia. At long last, he has recognised the fact that we have a drought of giant proportions. At long last, by the middle of October in some cases, the government will actually do something about it. It is still, though, a costing of $164 million over two years&mdash;about the same amount that the Prime Minister offered to pull down the Cahill Expressway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that the government has realised there is a drought it has to do something about it. I hope that there will be good long-term measures to help the farming communities in the future. I do not want to see the debacle the government has allowed to develop, hitting the farming community in the guts and making sure they were down on their hands and knees before this drought even started by all the taxes and charges that it has imposed on them over the last 10 years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon we had the government's response to the disastrous drought partially affecting Queensland, a substantial part of northern New South Wales and beyond. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) waxed lyrical about the extensive consultation that has occurred but the drought in Queensland has been running for at least four years and it really is only in the last 10 days that the Prime Minister has apparently become involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As with all his involvements, he described this package as `most innovative'. But it was the coalition, through shadow minister John Anderson and through its drought policy, that pushed drought onto the front page of the national dailies and onto the television. I have had occasion in this place to commend John Anderson: he will make a truly informed and concerned minister for primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the government has seen the sense of adopting the coalition policy of suspending assets tests on welfare payments and Austudy. Senator Boswell has done more than anyone else to highlight the absurdity and unfairness of farm families being excluded from rights conferred on each and every other Australian. At his press conference this afternoon, the Prime Minister talked a lot about his concern for the family farm structure. It is good, even at this late stage, that he has had some conversion to this essential structure of rural and regional Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of shortfalls in the package. The first is that there is no introduction of a drought relief fodder subsidy. Senator Collins said that it was rejected outright because it was `rorted to hell' in the 1982-83 drought. I asked Senator Collins to disclose whether any farmer was ever convicted for rorting the system because that is just plain humbug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the title, `exceptional drought' is used but not explained. Presumably, the test of exceptional circumstances is still appropriate. Nothing is said about placing `severe drought' in the national disaster relief arrangements which would provide more assistance and special concessional loans like low interest replanting loans essential for farmers at this time. These should apply additionally to drought affected small business. I commend the government for the increased funding provided to RAS. However, it is worth noting that accessing these interest rate subsidies is very difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, the planning for the future that the Prime Minister talks of in this package is just a pipedream. The government undertakes to encourage drought-proofing by investment allowances and further depreciation schedules for fodder and water conservation. The Prime Minister made the extraordinary comment that indiscriminate water conservation can lead to land degradation. If these areas of depreciation are so obviously in need of reform, why were they not addressed in the 1992 drought policy or in general taxation reform along the way in each year's budget?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, the government has failed to look after the Australian farm worker. Many farm employees risk losing their jobs because of this drought. There is no provision to pay the jobsearch allowance to them so that they can be kept on farms until farmers can pay them again. Premier Fahey in New South Wales could see the value in this. The government has shown no heart in giving a fair go to Australian farmhands. They are a resource that needs to be protected until the drought is over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, the Prime Minister made much of the generosity of the package. The response to the government's $14 million last month was to describe it as pitiful, especially compared with the government's instant response of $150 million to the Cahill Expressway and the multi-millions thrown to the waterside workers to get them back to work after their recent strike. Indeed, if the same tax breaks extended to ANL were extended to farm workers, employees in the rural industry would be $350 million better off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1982-83 drought the coalition willingly provided $341 million&mdash;about $630 million in today's terms&mdash;for drought stricken farmers. When the drought broke this ensured that they preserved their breeding herds and flocks and were in a position to bounce back. It is important to put the drought relief package in its correct economic context by acknowledging that for every one per cent increase in interest rates farmers are slugged an extra $170 million in mortgages and repayments. I hope that when the Prime Minister asks the banks to play their part and resist foreclosing on farmers they tell him that the best thing he can do for farmers is to stop pursuing policies which push up interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sixthly, there is no attempt to tackle the question of farm debt. I again call for a farm debt summit. Farmers, not including country small business, are sitting on a $17 billion&mdash;$17 billion!&mdash;raft of debt. The government must attempt to look at the options in handling that part of the debt which is unsustainable, and some of it of course will be. The Prime Minister at least admitted that the government is part of the solution, and it was pleasing to see him say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the government has provided some relief for the social and economic hardship being felt by farmers in rural communities. It has provided little, however, to retain the breeding stock so essential for recovery and for bouncing back after the drought, and it has done virtually nothing to ensure recovery and economic and taxation planning for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said it would do something but it has done very little. In fact, Senator Collins had the gall to say that IEDs, the income equalisation deposit schemes so successful in the early 1980s, have worked. He should go and ask a few farm accountants. The Australian Labor Party has an appalling macro-economic record for regional Australia. For years it ran a high inflation economy. Farmers, being price takers, saw profits eroded by costs rising between 10 per cent to 14 per cent a year throughout most of the 1980s.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Labor allowed interest rates far above those of our competitors&mdash;over 20 per cent&mdash;and even today rural counsellors tell you that most of their clients are paying in excess of 14 per cent. It made farmers bear the burden of deregulation in the economy while Labor's mates were feather-bedded. It gutted IEDs which were, and still are in the right form, the prudent farmer's drought assurance. Having stripped away everything else, as Senator Boswell said earlier today, and despite taxation incentives to help farmers plan for difficult times, the inevitable happened. We ran into another severe drought and the government was caught with very little in place to cope with the situation.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Labor as a party has never really conducted its own inquests, reformed its systems or repudiated those who let it, and those who voted for it, down.</PARA>
<PARA>Patently this is not the case and any examination of the record will so prove. As the former state secretary of the ALP, I am well placed to comment on the response of the ALP to the royal commission and its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First I wish to deal with the response of the Lawrence government. The Labor Lawrence government called the royal commission and gave it very wide terms of reference and powers. The commission was extremely well-funded and received every assistance from that government. The Lawrence government on receiving the royal commission report provided for the proper resourcing of the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions to pursue any matter referred to that office by the royal commission. The Labor state government committed itself immediately to the implementation of the recommendations contained in the second report of the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recommendation of the royal commission was for the formation of the Commission on Government. The state Liberal Party frustrated attempts to establish that commission prior to the 1993 state election. Now, two years after the royal commission's report, the Court government has still not implemented that major recommendation of the royal commission. The laws passed by the parliament to ensure public disclosure of donations in 1992 have still not been proclaimed. The Liberals' failure to implement the royal commission's recommendations and their political interference with the office of the DPP prevent the restoration of confidence in government in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the response of the ALP. Clearly it is inappropriate to make remarks, as some others have, about individuals facing trials or possible appeal processes. The ALP is very proud of its many achievements for the state during the terms of office of the Burke, Dowding and Lawrence governments. Equally, ALP members were disturbed and shocked by much of the evidence of the royal commission and subsequent trials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The party was determined to respond immediately to any evidence of inappropriate behaviour or failure of party administration. Among many measures adopted by the ALP in response to that evidence, the ALP closed down the John Curtin Foundation; endorsed a mandatory fund-raising code of conduct; wrote into its state rules the most stringent possible rules in relation to the control of campaign finances, which included ensuring the candidate or member was at arm's length from the process.

The ALP assisted the tax office with its inquiries regarding the taxation liability arising from leader's accounts and took a commercial decision to accept the taxation liability arising from leader's accounts despite the absence of full information as to the ownership of those funds. It is clearly not the case that the ALP organisation failed to respond to the findings of the royal commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue raised again in recent days is the call for the repudiation of those facing trial or already convicted. Calls for the ALP to repudiate individuals misses the point. From the beginning the ALP formed the view that it should investigate any matters brought to its attention and pursue those issues where appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the action of individuals, the ALP resolved not to set itself up as judge and jury, but resolved to let the royal commission, the DPP and the courts do their job. Those law enforcement agencies at all times received the full cooperation of the ALP. The ALP has not indulged and should not indulge in an internal witch-hunt but has let the proper judicial processes take their course. Some individual members of the party have chosen to show their personal friendship and support for those facing charges. That is their right and they should not be criticised for that display of personal friendship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP organisation has supported the proper state processes for resolving the issue of guilt or innocence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular issue in question is an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Health and Aged Care Journal</EMPHASIS> by its editor-in-chief, Ms Karen Linnell. The editorial is a vitriolic, unjustified, incorrect and completely unsubstantiated attack on one of the most caring industries in Australia today. While it focuses on the proprietors of nursing homes, it includes by intimation thousands of devoted nursing home staff, nurses and associated workers, and indeed by implication thousands of relatives of residents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of unsubstantiated accusations in the article. Ms Linnell accuses owners of pocketing public funds while they run their nursing homes into the ground. Where is the evidence for this? The truth is exactly the opposite. Recently many proprietors have gone broke while trying to provide a caring environment within the financial constraints set by the Commonwealth government. Ms Linnell says that owners are greedy, corrupt and demand kickbacks and that this is a part of the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Linnell produces not a single piece of evidence to support this, and I am not aware of a single substantiated case where this incident has happened. If Ms Linnell has any substantiating evidence, she should ensure that both the police and the Commonwealth authorities are provided with it. If there happen to be a few bad eggs in the nursing home basket&mdash;the majority of nursing home proprietors are, in fact, decent and devoted to the welfare of their residents&mdash;there is still no justification for defaming the whole industry in this way. The editor should put aside her prejudices and produce some facts to support these wild statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She says that some of the wealthiest nursing home proprietors run some of the most substandard homes. Again, I ask: where is there a shred of evidence to support this? In fact, the contrary is true. I am familiar with most of the proprietors. For example, Doug Moran, one of the wealthy proprietors whom I know very well, runs nursing homes which are second to none in this country. They are nursing homes which one would be happy to live in and which pass the `mum test'&mdash;which essentially means that a child would be happy for his or her mum to live in it&mdash;which is the most appropriate test in most cases. These are nursing homes which not only offer good physical environments, but are committed to the very high standards of care and caring. I am happy to acknowledge that the government's changes have had a significant part to play in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Ms Linnell wants to regain any credibility, she must produce some substantiation, some facts to support these outrageous and nonsensical claims. For example, she says that many people in the industry know how poor the accommodation and services are in many nursing homes. This may well have been true 15 years ago, but nowadays it is simply wrong. I say again that this is partly due to the monitoring which goes on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it possible that the editor of a magazine which purports to understand this industry is not aware of the standard monitoring teams or the outcome standards? It certainly seems so or, if she is aware of them, she is implying either incompetence on the part of the SMTs or, worse still, even corruption and, therefore, implying that these public servants are for one reason or another not doing their jobs properly. Again, I ask: where is the evidence? I am sure that Senator Crowley would support my view that the standard monitoring teams do a very thorough job&mdash;some would say too thorough in many cases. If anything, there is too much monitoring, in as much as there is duplication between the federal and state governments. The reality is far removed from this nonsensical article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Ms Linnell says that the debate is driven by self-interest and greed by proprietors who have rorted the system for years. What are the facts? They are completely at variance with this claim by Ms Linnell. The government's own 1991 review found an immediate payment of $1.56 per day per resident should be granted. Professor Gregory's report indicated that an extra $4.57 per resident per day was needed to cover the costs of building, upgrading and providing essential services. The Gregory report also stated that between $540 million and $1 billion was needed to bring nursing homes up to scratch, and that the Commonwealth funding had not met this necessary need. The other independent report, by Arthur Andersen, found that nursing homes across Australia received on average only 6c per resident per day as a return on their investment. So much for nursing home proprietors rorting the system or lining their own pockets, as was claimed in this article by Ms Linnell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are the facts? The facts are that the standards of care in the nursing home industry are very good. They compare with most other countries around the world. The facts are that it is an industry with a relatively poor financial return. It is not a goldmine for greedy individuals to pillage. It is an industry in which the vast majority of the owners and workers are caring and dedicated people. Ms Linnell's article is defamatory of everybody who works in this industry, and it is something which the author should be ashamed of. I received a letter today from George Hardi, a respected proprietor in Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen during my 32 years in the industry many attacks on nursing homes but frankly I can not recall a more vicious, ill willed, defamatory article anywhere, not even during the darkest Whitlam years. This woman should be banned from working in the health care field.</PARA>
<PARA>They are sentiments which I think would receive wide support. I have had a number of phone calls from people involved in the area&mdash;proprietors and others&mdash;who are appalled at this article. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This unsubstantiated article defames a number of good people. It undermines the morale in the industry. But the person who suffers the most in the end is Ms Linnell, who is left with no credibility in this area. Sadly, this also reflects on the other staff of the journal, many of whom are known to have the highest professional standards. To prevent further damage to their reputation&mdash;not to mention her own&mdash;Ms Linnell should print an immediate retraction and apology. If this does not occur, the journal cannot claim in any way to understand the industry and will find that its circulation and advertising support will presumably fall accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the government's role in this? The government should take note of the recommendations in the Gregory  report, in particular, and provide the appropriate funding as soon as possible. This is funding which will increase both the SAM and CAM element, and the capital grants element, which will mean that the residents will be able to live in the appropriate standards of comfort and care. The beneficiaries will be the residents in nursing homes. These are the people on whom we should be focusing and for whom we should be caring. That is the aim of the proprietors. It is the aim of the thousands of workers in the industry. It should be the aim of us all, including this government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To most Australians, the name Frank Moorhouse these days refers to a distinguished Australian author. It is his father, the late Frank Moorhouse Snr, who died earlier this year in his 90th year, of whom I wish to speak about tonight. In the dairy areas of Australia, especially on the south coast of New South Wales, the name Frank Moorhouse does not mean an author, but it means Moorhouse the Machinery Man whose products were a major factor in upgrading the Australian dairy industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first met Frank Moorhouse about 20 years ago when he was a young, energetic 70-year-old, heavily involved in most of the worthwhile things being done in the Shoalhaven area. He was a genuine full-time citizen of the Shoalhaven. He was a wonderful supporter to me during my three terms as the member for Macarthur in the House of Representatives. I was fortunate to maintain my close friendship with him for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His annual Christmas card was something quite different. It was a bit of a story about what had happened to him, his family and his beloved wife, Purth, during the year. Maybe that is where Frank Moorhouse Jnr inherited some of his literary skills. The thing about Frank Moorhouse was that I certainly never heard him raise his voice in anger&mdash;and I do not know of anyone else who did either&mdash;make any derogatory remarks about anyone or use a swear word, which is quite striking when one is running an engineering business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was born in Wanganui, New Zealand, into a dairy farming family in 1904. He left school at an early age and trained to be an electrical engineer. He was one of the first licensed electricians in that country, holding licence No. 4. He migrated, as so many New Zealanders do, such as my father, to Sydney in 1925&mdash;which was about the same time my father came as well&mdash;with about #10 in his pocket and an introductory letter to the Diabolo Separator Company, where he gained employment as a milking machine technician. The first task allotted to him in that firm was to install a milking machine in every dairying district in New South Wales, which he succeeded in doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1928, he married Purthenary Cutts. They moved to the Shoalhaven district, naturally one of Australia's best dairying areas, which was their home ever since. From this union there were three sons, Owen, Arthur and Frank, the author. There were seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those days, the problem in the dairying industry was with boiling water for sterilising dairy utensils. With his engineering ability, he invented and manufactured a very efficient device that would boil water very rapidly with a minimum amount of fuel. This was marketed as the Moorhouse dairy boiler. Approximately 20,000 of these were manufactured and distributed throughout the three eastern states. From these early beginnings in a small factory, the business continued to grow and prosper with the manufacture of dairy equipment and machinery sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The name Moorhouse the Machinery Man became synonymous throughout eastern Australia with the dairy industry and with a high quality product. When Mr Jack Ferguson&mdash;a man known to you, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;was chairman of the New South Wales milk board in 1952, he made the remark that the Moorhouse dairy boiler was the greatest single contribution to good quality milk for Sydney and, certainly, the word `quality' and Frank Moorhouse are synonymous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1956 he attended the world conference on farm mechanisation held in Paris. He was deputy leader of the New South Wales government trade mission to South Africa and Kenya in 1969. In 1975 he was a participant in the Australian international trade display in Fiji. In 1977 he represented the Department of Overseas Trade at the international farm machinery show in California. So he was certainly heavily involved in his industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His sons Owen and Arthur, after their technical education, joined the business and became Moorhouse the Machinery Man and Sons. The youngest son, Frank, began his career as a journalist and, as I mentioned, is now one of Australia's best known authors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Frank Moorhouse served the Boy Scout movement in a very involved way as group chairman, scout commissioner and patron. In World War II he was a company commander in the Volunteer Defence Corps with the rank of captain. In 1944 he founded the Nowra Technical College and was chairman of the district advisory committee for 30 years. He served four years as an alderman with the Municipality of Nowra, and the council honoured him by naming the park at the entrance of the town Moorhouse Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1948 he became a justice of the peace and, in 1955, deputy sheriff, a position he held for 30 years. He used to produce and sell the Shoalhaven historic homes calendar, which earned a lot for the Shoalhaven Historical Society, of which he had been an active member for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the early 1930s he was initiated into freemasonry, an organisation he served with distinction, progressing through the offices until in 1991 he attained one of the highest honours in that organisation, the rank of past deputy grand master. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The instigation of supervision of the non-denominational chapel at the Shoalhaven District Hospital was his work and he did it to commemorate 100 years of freemasonry in the Shoalhaven district. In 1934 he was a charter member of the Rotary club of Nowra, holding almost every executive position, being president twice and district governor of district 275. He was awarded the Paul Harris Fellowship in 1977, one of Rotary's highest honours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1984 he became Shoalhaven's senior citizen of the year and went on to become the state senior citizen of the year. One of the highlights of his life was in 1988 when he was honoured by the Commonwealth for his service to the community with an OAM. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say that Frank Moorhouse had a very full and a very distinguished life and I am certain that he will be sadly missed in the Shoalhaven area where he was a commanding presence.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The $40,000 allocated for the purchase of media distribution through AAP Facilities Pty Ltd was raised as a purchase order for the current financial year and listed in the Office Services Gazette as is required for planned expenditure of amounts of $2000 or more.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1155" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) entered the Panguna mine around 16 August 1994, receiving no casualties and encountering no resistance in the process. It immediately began to secure the mine area by establishing itself in key positions both in and around the mine. Following an initial period of non-confrontation lasting several days, the security forces suffered five deaths and several casualties as a result of BRA sniper fire. The Government is not aware of any reciprocal BRA casualties over this period. Under the terms of an ceasefire agreement signed between the BRA and the PNG Government on 8 September 1994, a ceasefire on Bougainville came into effect at midnight on 9 September 1994. Amongst a range of provisions, the ceasefire agreement stipulates that Panguna and three other areas are declared neutral zones and that parts of a South Pacific peacekeeping force shall be deployed to each area to supervise the withdrawal of the PNGDF.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The fact that the PNGDF occupied and retained ground at Panguna could be read as amounting to `capture', notwithstanding the casualties suffered. But it cannot be said that the PNGDF secured the mine site completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Australian Government recognises that the PNGDF has a legitimate and useful role to play on Bougainville, a point acknowledged in the Report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation which visited Bougainville in April this year. The Government nevertheless believes that the conflict on Bougainville cannot be solved by purely military means, and that a lasting peace will only be established once all parties recognise this and negotiate a peaceful settlement. The Government welcomes, therefore, the signing on 3 September 1994 of the `Honiara Commitments to Peace on Bougainville' and the signing of the ceasefire agreement on 8 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) As the Government has always supported a peaceful resolution to the Bougainville conflict, it follows that the Government prefers to see negotiation rather than military action on the island. The Government does not believe that military operations such as the one which occurred at Panguna will be ultimately constructive in resolving the situation. Indeed, Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister Sir Julius Chan acknowledged the negative effect on the peace process of the former PNG Government's decision to deploy troops into the mine area, by publicly apologising to the BRA on 4 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) (a) The Government has always maintained that there can be no purely military solution to the conflict in Bougainville. It also agrees with the Delegation's assertion within recommendation 6.2 that secession through force is not an option. The Government believes that the BRA has no mandate from the Bougainvillean people to represent them and that the Papua New Guinea government is the democratically elected constitutional authority in North Solomons Province.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) The Government agrees with the delegation's assessment that the future of the Bougainville Copper Limited (BCL) mine at Panguna should not be addressed until there is normalcy in Bougainville. The Government recognises that the issue of the mine's future is sensitive to Bougainvilleans and that any discussion on its reopening, preceding general stability on the island, would only obstruct progress toward peace. In this context the Government welcomed comments by former PNG Prime Minister Paias Wingti on 16 August 1994 that "the Government is not going to rush in to open the mine. . . that is not our priority. . . our priority is not the mine. We want our people to get back to normal life". The Government also notes the fact that no mention has been made of the Panguna mine in the agenda for the proposed Bougainville Peace Conference to be held under the provisions of the Honiara Commitments and the ceasefire agreement.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) In the Government's response to the tabling of the Parliamentary delegation's report on 8 June 1994, I warmly welcomed the report and the useful suggestions it contained in terms of resolving the conflict, not the least of which was the `timetable for peaceful resolution' proposed within recommendation 6.8. The Government believes that the visit and recommendations of the Parliamentary delegation have assisted in bringing about the climate in which a process of dialogue has been able to commence. A similar timetable to that contained within recommendation 6.8 has been adopted by both parties in the Honiara Commitments, which the Government has also welcomed. The main provisions of the agreement are that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">all forces will maintain static positions and that a ceasefire will be declared within seven days of the signing of the agreement;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a South Pacific peacekeeping force will deployed to Bougainville as soon as practicably possible after the declaration of the ceasefire when the mechanisms and arrangements for the force are finalised in consultations with participating governments and through consultation between the commanders of the forces of both sides;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the official lifting of the blockade shall be implemented following consultations by the PNG Government with the Solomon Islands Government and a third party;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the questions of pardon, amnesty and temporary refuge; reconciliation and compensation and restoration and reconstruction shall be addressed in the agenda for the Bougainville Peace Conference; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Bougainville Peace Conference shall be convened at a place in Bougainville or at another venue in PNG on a date to be agreed by both parties, preferably such date shall be no later than 10 October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ceasefire agreement further defines the roles and responsibilities of the proposed South Pacific peacekeeping force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) As the Government and the Parliamentary delegation have acknowledged, the PNGDF does have a legitimate role to play on Bougainville. On this basis the Government does not believe the PNGDF contravened any of the recommendations of the Parliamentary delegation.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) In August 1990, Australia responded to a United Nations (UN) questionnaire on the availability of personnel and equipment with a list of the types of forces which may be available for peace keeping operations.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Australian Defence Force (ADF) forms only a part, albeit generally a large part, of Australia's contribution to UN peace operations. The numbers of personnel available in principle to participate in new UN operations varies depending on the type of operation being mounted and the capabilities required to carry out that operation. None of the above listed capabilities are of fixed size. Also, units would be supplemented or reduced depending on the tasks required to be carried out and the security environment in the area of operations. For example, the current joint medical unit of 115 deployed to Rwanda is being protected by an infantry group of 106 and supported by 81 support troops. It should be noted that Australia is regularly called upon by the UN to provide advanced technical capabilities (eg. communications, engineering) not readily available in all other countries, rather than large numbers of troops.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Since the end of World War II, the UN has conducted 33 peace operations; Australia has contributed at varying levels to 19 of them. During this time, Australia has developed a reputation for providing well trained and well disciplined forces who adapt readily to these types of operations. Australia has been able to respond quickly and professionally to situations as they have arisen with forces that are maintained for the defence of Australia. Most military personnel deployed on UN operations are regular members of the ADF and are therefore professional military personnel. On occasions, where the operation requires specialist skills not available within the regular ADF (eg. specialist medical personnel), reserves may be seconded to the operation.</PARA>
