<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Defence Determination 1994/27, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 25 August 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The definition of "deployment" in clause 3 includes service declared by the Minister for Defence to be relevant service. The definition of "operational area" includes an area declared to be such by the Chief of the Defence Force. Subclauses 4.2 and 4.3 confer similar powers on the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel. Subclause 5.1 appears to allow the Minister to increase allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that these provisions, particularly subclause 5.1, appear to be subdelegations of legislative power and, as such, invalid unless expressly authorised by the parent Act. In this context the Committee noted the advice in the Explanatory Memorandum that the discretions relate to deployments rather than to individual cases, which indicates that these powers are legislative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 16 August 1991 the Committee wrote to your predecessor, Senator the Hon Peter Cook, about similar powers in Overseas Defence Determination 1991/61, although we did not raise the validity of the subdelegation at that time. On 30 September 1991 the Committee was advised that instances of such declarations were rare and would not be used when alternative means were available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On another point, subclause 5.1 does not provide for the way in which the Minister is to exercise the power to increase the Deployment Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee noted the advice in the letter of 8 July 1994 from the Department about other aspects of the present Determination and accepts that special arrangements may be necessary when the safety and security of Australians serving</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">overseas may be prejudiced. In this context, however, the Committee noted clause 47 of the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994, which provides that a House of the Parliament may require any document incorporated in a legislative instrument to be made available for inspection. It is not necessary for you to address this issue in your reply to this letter, but we mention it as a matter which may affect the administration of some future Determinations.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to my interim reply of 19 September 1994 to your letter of 25 August 1994 to the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, about Defence Determination 1994/27.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I indicated then that the issues raised were substantial and that I would write to you again when I had considered a detailed report from the Department of Industrial Relations. I apologise for the length of time it has taken to provide you with a substantive reply. In the event, however, your letter gave rise to an unusually complex set of policy and drafting issues which have had to be resolved in parallel, and in consultation with all the interested parties (including the Australian Defence Force, the Attorney-General's Department, and relevant Ministers).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, the Department of Industrial Relations has received legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicating that there is a need to rectify some defects in Defence Determination 1994/27, but that the basic approach is valid. A copy of the advice is at Appendix A.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically, I have concluded that it is possible to interpret the definitions of "deployment" and "operational area" as involving invalid subdelegations of legislative power. While the Department's intention was to rely on declarations made independently of the Determination and for a range of purposes unrelated to payment of the allowance, it is necessary to put the matter beyond doubt. The legal advice also identifies a problem to do with the authority for the Determination to rely on such declarations as in force from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand, the advice is that the key provisions of clause 4&mdash;the authority for the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to approve threat levels&mdash;are a valid subdelegation of an administrative (not legislative) discretion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The authority for the Minister to approve additional amounts of allowance under clause 5 is probably in the same category, but is more open to question in view of the Minister's discretion to increase the rate within a range rather than by a fixed amount. Again, I recognise a need to put the matter beyond doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of these conclusions, action has been taken quickly to amend the Determination to address your Committee's concerns and the associated policy issues. The amending Defence Determination 1994/57 was drafted in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department, and the Explanatory Memorandum gives full details of the effect of the amendments. An advance copy is at Appendix B, and the usual printed copies will be forwarded to Parliament for tabling as soon as possible. A copy of Defence Determination 1994/27 as amended is at Appendix C.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this meets the Committee's concerns.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CAMBODIA: THE CURRENT SECURITY SITUATION</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliamentary Statement by Senator the Hon Gareth Evans QC, Minister for Foreign Affairs, The Senate, Canberra, 29 November 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Australia's Interests and Expectations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Australia's involvement in Cambodia flows from a number of national interests: our national interest in removing Cambodia as a source of regional instability and tension; our national interest, as a good international citizen, in relieving to the extent possible the enormous humanitarian problems posed by continuing insurgency in Cambodia; and our national interest in facilitating Cambodia's&mdash;and Indochina's&mdash;economic and political reintegration into regional and international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These interests remain as valid now as they did when the Australian peace initiative for Cambodia was launched in November 1989, although the economic factor should not be exaggerated. Australia's current trade with Cambodia is insignificant, and realistically cannot be expected to grow until the international rehabilitation and reconstruction effort is much further down the track.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the range of Australia's interests, and the intensity of our involvement in the crafting and application of the UN peace plan, it was never our expectation that the plan, however successfully implemented, would be itself a universal panacea for all the many problems confronting the country: it could only give peace a chance. As I noted on the occasion of the signing of the Paris Agreements on 23 October 1991:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The point is simply that peace and freedom are not prizes which, once gained, can never be lost. They must be won again each day   . . .   In the final analysis it will be the Cambodian people themselves who must take their country successfully through the transitional period, and it is the freely elected leaders of Cambodia who must take their country towards a more prosperous and secure future. The rest of us here wish them well in this great task, and commit ourselves by our signature of these documents to providing all the support and assistance we can.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, following the successful holding democratic elections in Cambodia, I said in a statement on 4 June 1993:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The important thing to appreciate is that the democratic foundations for the country's future have now been strongly laid, and it is essentially now for the Cambodian people and parties themselves to resolve how they want to be governed. It is neither possible nor desirable for the international community to try to micro-manage each step of the way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Government has never been either ignorant or naively optimistic about the massive scale of the problems that would have to be dealt with by the newly elected Government, not least the problem of containing the Khmer Rouge (KR) after it walked away from the peace process in 1992. But we have taken the view from the outset that the KR insurgency would be containable and ultimately defeatable&mdash;in the same way that communist insurgencies had been contained and ultimately defeated in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines&mdash;provided there was a government in place with democratic legitimacy, a continued cessation of the kind of direct external support the KR had received in the past, and continued support both for economic reconstruction and national institution-building from the international community. The speed and effectiveness with which the internal security problem could be dealt with would depend a great deal on how united, competent and committed the new Cambodian Government proved to be: the international community could, and should, give every possible assistance, but ultimately the responsibility for progress depended on the elected representatives of the Cambodian people themselves. All this remains our view today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Involvement of Khmer Rouge in the Peace Plan</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international community accepted from the outset that there was no viable alternative to a solution involving all four of the Cambodian factions, including the Khmer Rouge (KR), in that plan. The reason was simple: without such an arrangement, the external patrons&mdash;particularly China and Vietnam&mdash;would not have been able to disassociate themselves from their Cambodian clients, respectively the KR and the `State of Cambodia' (SOC) in Phnom Penh. Without this disengagement, the endlessly destructive civil war would have continued indefinitely.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that China and Vietnam did in fact disengage, that objective has been achieved. Our longer term goal nevertheless remains the continuing reduction, and ultimate removal, of the KR as a factor in the Cambodian political equation&mdash;a process which the KR themselves accelerated when they effectively withdrew from the peace process in 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Current Military Situation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KR does not pose a direct military threat to the existence of the Cambodian Government, which continues to have the support of the bulk of the population and to control most of the national territory. The KR is able to concentrate its forces for limited periods, but it cannot sustain conventional operations on a large scale, primarily due to lack of manpower and dwindling sources of logistical support. It does not have the capability to take and hold a target such as a provincial capital for any length of time. While some recruiting is apparently occurring, including by coercive methods, the KR's current grassroots support is far from sufficient to enable it to significantly expand its numbers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KR nevertheless poses a severe security problem for the government and this problem is likely to continue in one form or another unless the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) are made more effective. The annual cycle of insurgent activity and military response is also robbing the Government and people of the resources and energy needed for the reconstruction effort upon which Cambodia has made a good start in the year since the formation of the new government. A heightened guerrilla campaign against the Government in the coming dry season cannot be ruled out, but the scale of the fighting is likely to follow an established pattern of skirmishing, guerrilla hit-and-run tactics and terrorist attacks, avoiding large, set-piece battles. The KR also adopt the tactic common in guerrilla wars of establishing a defensible base, usually in a fairly inaccessible area, from which smaller units can spread out over a wider area to stage attacks. The KR has demonstrated that, in current circumstances and without significant international assistance to the RCAF, it is capable of conducting this sort of campaign for some years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although a signatory of the 1991 Paris Agreements, the KR subsequently refused to cooperate with the disarmament phase of the UN peace plan, and did not take part in the UN-sponsored elections held in May last year. The KR does not recognise the election results as legitimate, and it aims to regain sole power by destabilising the Cambodian Government politically, economically and militarily, through protracted insurgency.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KR is conducting a campaign of military activity in order to damage infrastructure, harass RCAF forces, and promote an impression of widespread insecurity in order to discourage economic development, particularly through foreign aid and investment. Its ongoing warfare is also designed to protect its existing areas of control and to enhance its areas of influence. Related activity includes revenue-raising through trade in timber and gems across the Thai border, and through bandit activity including hostage-taking, levying illegal taxes and making demands for protection money in poorly-defended areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Military activity is concentrated in the rural areas of north and north-western Cambodia contiguous with the Thai and Lao borders, although skirmishes occur elsewhere. This activity is generally at a low level, with periodic escalations against vulnerable areas or in response to RCAF operations. Casualties are generally few in number. Currently KR units are infiltrating rural areas around the city of Battambang (the nearest large city to the KR HQ at Pailin in north-western Cambodia), but the RCAF looks well able to hold the city should the KR stage an attack. There is also increased KR activity in Siem Reap province (surrounding the Angkor ruins).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">KR Strength</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KR is a secret organisation closed to outsiders, and it has never been possible to be absolutely precise about KR fighting strength. It is clear however that, claims to the contrary notwithstanding, KR strength has been reduced significantly over the last two years&mdash;although a hard core will inevitably remain which is unlikely to defect or be eradicated other than by military means. Our best estimate, based on all available information, is that in 1991 KR military strength was 25,000-27,000 combat troops, with perhaps as many again in support roles. By April 1992, following the arrival of UNTAC, KR numbers had fallen to 20,000-25,000 in total. Currently we judge the KR have no more than 8,000-10,000 men in the field, though in small concentrations scattered around the country. Of this figure, hard-core fighters may be as few as 5000, with the balance comprising porters and support personnel, who act as military reinforcements when necessary. Non-fighting or supporting family members are not included in this figure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decline in KR strength is due mainly to KR defecting to the RCAF. There were large numbers of KR defections during the UNTAC period, although some of the defectors subsequently rejoined the KR. There has since been a steady trickle of defections to the RCAF, which, assisted by the Cambodian Government's amnesty law, is actively promoting defections as part of its overall strategy of containing the KR. The recent RCAF operation in Kampot Province, which resulted in several hundred KR defections, is an example of this strategy, and there are indications it may serve as encouragement for KR units elsewhere in the country to follow suit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KR are attempting to counter such losses by using violence and intimidation to obtain forced labour and military reinforcements/porters for the coming dry season. Reports of large scale kidnappings of rural villagers are now being received from a number of provinces in the north and northwest. In late October, the KR kidnapped and subsequently killed about 50 villagers in Bavel District of Battambang Province. Several hundred villagers were also abducted by the KR in Siem Reap province in early November. They are reportedly used as forced labour and also possibly to swell KR ranks. These tactics probably indicate that the KR is becoming more desperate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">KR Area of Control/Influence</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has also been a steady decline in both KR areas of control and areas of influence since the middle of 1992. The information available to us indicates that in September 1992 the KR controlled approximately 20-25 per cent of the country, and controlled and influenced 30-35 per cent. In March 1993, the KR's area of control was 15-20 per cent and its area of control and influence 25-30 per cent. In July 1994, its area of control had fallen to less than 10 per cent, and is more likely to be nearer 5 per cent; and its area of control and influence declined to 10-20 per cent. This latest figure will not necessarily hold at this level, given the cyclical nature (dry and wet season driven) of the Cambodian insurgency. To put all these figures into perspective, it must also be noted that, given that the KR tends to be concentrated in some of the least accessible areas of Cambodia, the proportion of the national population which comes under KR control is probably only around 3 per cent of a total population of around 9 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">KR Intentions and Strategy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no evidence that the KR leadership has abandoned its ultimate goal of regaining sole power in Cambodia by whatever means possible. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that they must be feeling the effects of increasing political isolation. By not participating in the 1993 UN-organised elections and by reneging on their commitments made under the terms of the Paris Agreements, the KR have extinguished any possibility of gaining a degree of international legitimacy. Following its formation, the Cambodian Government left the door open for the inclusion of the KR in the national polity. Two sets of round table talks were held (in May and June this year) to try to include the KR, and both failed. The KR was formally outlawed by the National Assembly on 7 July 1994. They can expect no further official support from China or Thailand. Strong Thai Government support for the Cambodian Government was reaffirmed as recently as mid-November. The Thai Government has also moved, particularly since July, to stop longstanding relationships and arrangements between freelance Thai military and business elements and the KR.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The KR are also under some military pressure. In mid-1993 (ie. following the Cambodian elections), KR policy changed from rejecting the UNTAC process and seeking to disrupt it, to calling for all parties to accept the election results. This about-face by the KR was probably to encourage Prince Sihanouk to find a means of including them legitimately within the national polity, under the rubric of "national reconciliation". Although the RCAF's last dry season offensive failed to meet its over-ambitious objectives (see paras 19-20 below) the RCAF did, for a time, force the KR onto the defensive in parts of their heartland.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These combined pressures, however, have so far been insufficient to force any real change in the KR's underlying strategy and objectives. An assessment of KR intentions based upon their behaviour in the post-UNTAC phase indicates that the KR is unlikely to negotiate to the extent of disarming, or allowing government access to the areas under KR control. This would inevitably weaken the KR's hold over its population base and further threaten its remaining trade in gems and timber. Disarming its fighting forces or merging them into the RCAF would remove the KR's only means of exercising exclusive power in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the longer term, the KR may be pinning its hopes upon an expectation that corruption, faltering economic progress and factional divisiveness will split the government and erode its support among the Cambodian people, enabling the KR to assume power. They may also believe that their advantage lies in a long campaign of guerilla warfare to wear down the government, constrain economic development, deter foreign investors and donors, and foment insecurity&mdash;with the aim of leaving the government no alternative, if peace is to be obtained, other than to offer the KR a power-sharing role. This is an unlikely outcome since the elected government is strongly opposed to it. And even if the KR were to become part of the government process, all the evidence suggests that they would not relinquish their ultimate aim of acquiring exclusive power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the KR continues its open defiance of the central Government, Cambodia is likely to face a protracted internal insurgency situation not uncommon in South East Asia over the past forty years. However, we would not see such an insurgency seriously threatening the viability of the Cambodian Government in the short term. Over the longer term, prospects would depend on the effectiveness of the government in delivering fair government, economic development and security, as well as the commitment of the international donor community to support Cambodia's economic development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RCAF Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RCAF's response to KR harassment has been patchy and indecisive. It did manage to capture some traditional KR areas, including Anlong Veng (in northern Cambodia) in February this year and the KR's headquarters town of Pailin (in the north-west) in March. In both cases, however, the KR was able to successfully employ classic insurgency tactics, allowing the ill-prepared and over-confident RCAF force to seize an area which it then could not hold against concerted insurgent harassment. The KR regained ascendancy in the Anlong Veng area after two weeks, and recaptured Pailin after a month.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of the government's reverses in Anlong Veng and Pailin should not be underestimated. RCAF forces showed poor discipline, inadequate training, low morale and inability to get equipment and supplies to forces who needed them. Rather than the original victories serving to underline the RCAF's credibility, these subsequent defeats served to highlight its many and fundamental weaknesses as a military force. In many ways worse was the negative impact on national morale, and it could be said that the recapture by the KR of Pailin marked the end of the honeymoon period for the Cambodian Government, both with its people and with the international community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cycle of diminished military activity during the wet season (April-November) and more aggressive actions by the RCAF during the dry season (December-March) is likely to continue&mdash;although the two Prime Ministers have stated that the RCAF will not be mounting major offensives against the KR in the coming dry season as they did in the last. The RCAF will concentrate instead on a strategy of containment. Nevertheless, the dry season is likely to see an increase in the overall level of military activity, even if the RCAF does not embark on an offensive against the KR strongholds of Anlong Veng and Pailin. Military encounters could also be sparked by a significant KR attack in one area or another&mdash;and there is already speculation about this prospect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outlook is for a long period of low-level warfare, with the RCAF not seeking to push the KR out of the core areas they control, and the KR facing greater difficulty in expanding its current areas of control and influence, not least because of increasing re-supply difficulties. Nevertheless, the KR will remain a major problem, preoccupying the security forces and diverting attention and scarce resources from Cambodia's economic and social recovery. In that regard, perhaps the KR's most effective course will be to undermine and damage the RCAF's intangible assets such as morale, confidence and sense of purpose.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RCAF strength on paper is about 130,000 but a more realistic figure would be less than 100,000, the difference being accounted for by "ghost soldiers" who remain on the payroll to help boost the income of unit commanders. The RCAF's structure has been further distorted by the excessive numbers of senior officers, many of whom have purchased their ranks or were given them as political rewards. The RCAF's capability and performance is also hampered by infrastructural weaknesses, attributable to lack of budgetary support and financial accountability; morale and discipline problems; inadequate training; and continuing factional allegiances within the amalgamated force.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These problems should not, however, be regarded as too unexpected since the RCAF was formed barely a year ago from the forces of formerly opposing factions (the then Phnom Penh regime's CPAF on the one hand, and the anti-communist KPNLAF and Sihanoukist ANKI on the other) who had fought a bitter guerrilla war for over a decade. The troops had different loyalties, different levels of training and experience and were competing for the same limited resources. The varying interests of their commanders and officers had to be accommodated as did their concerns over rank and job security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These inherent difficulties were, and continue to be, compounded by the fragile political and economic environment of Cambodia which to an extent makes the problems confronting the RCAF almost inevitable. Rectifying them will thus require concerted planning and action at various levels. Nowhere in the world has the attempt been easy to amalgamate formerly opposing forces into a new army with a national sense of identity and purpose. The current difficulties being experienced in South Africa bear witness to that. Cambodia is no exception and the RCAF needs both time and encouragement to deal constructively with these problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these problems, the senior RCAF leadership has recognised the tasks ahead through an expressed commitment to reform, loyalty to the government and reasonable reliability in handling political incidents to date. The Chief of Staff, General Ke Kim Yan, is a highly professional officer with a realistic approach to the challenges before him, as demonstrated during his visits to Australia and other countries to discuss Cambodia's military situation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RCAF Reform</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RCAF has made a tentative start on its ambitious reform program, which was approved by both Prime Ministers in August 1994. The RCAF sees its main strategic aim as the defeat of the KR, which is to be achieved through reform of the RCAF, destroying the KR's logistics bases, improved rural development, and increased foreign military assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">31.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If these goals are to be achieved, the RCAF recognises that it will have to become a smaller, better trained and more disciplined professional force. The RCAF has developed a plan that addresses the immediate and longer-term problems. To be implemented over three years, the plan aims to reduce the RCAF to 70,000 personnel. The new force will include counter-insurgency battalions to pursue the KR, while six divisions will be retrained to protect economic and social development in strategic government-controlled areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">32.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implementation of rank reductions has commenced, with personnel being reduced to a rank commensurate with their level of command and duties. Ultimately, the number of generals will be reduced from some 2000 to 90. To set an example, both Defence Ministers and Chief of Staff Ke Kim Yan have been reduced from 4-star to 3-star generals. Military regions have established committees to oversee rank reductions. It is expected that this phase of the rank reduction process will be completed in about two months, despite resistance from some quarters. Basic training appears already to be taking place in some military regions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Security Outlook</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">33.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RCAF is not in immediate danger of collapse, even if it does not receive international military assistance. The military outlook is for a long period of low-level fighting, with the RCAF unable to gain control of territory held by the KR and, equally, with the latter facing great difficulty in expanding its areas of control and influence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">34.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much will depend on popular attitudes towards the KR and the government in rural areas. Although our knowledge of this is necessarily incomplete, indications are that the appeal of the KR to poor rural dwellers has more to do with their dissatisfaction with the RCAF and lack of any discernible improvement in their daily lives than with any intrinsic appeal of KR philosophy or programs. Even if the KR cannot expand significantly, we do not exclude the possibility that this trend will become more pronounced and more widespread&mdash;although the KR's increasing resort to coercive tactics in some areas will obviously count against them. Chronic low-level instability also encourages the emergence of spheres of power centred on provincial administrations, and only tenuously overseen by a preoccupied central authority, notwithstanding its recent attempts to centralise revenue-raising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">35.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the longer term, an improved security force is therefore vital in stabilising the Cambodian Government and marginalising the KR. International military assistance can play a valuable role in enabling the RCAF to develop the discipline and skills that it needs to achieve such an improvement as well as instilling a sense of confidence in the government to manage this very difficult period of transition and reform. Nevertheless, it cannot be overstated that international military assistance is not the sole solution to the RCAF's difficulties, let alone those of Cambodia more generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Improvement in the effectiveness of Cambodia's armed forces, moreover, is only one factor in marginalising the KR. As with any insurgent force, the KR cannot be defeated by military means alone. The government must also improve the living standards of the majority of the people, who live in the countryside. In order to do so, the government needs more than a better security force: it must also make progress toward achieving an efficient and effective bureaucracy, improved rural services, more jobs and a rehabilitated economic infrastructure. Moreover, it must develop more political cohesion, and restrain factional squabbling. If the government does not face these issues, no amount of military assistance will be able to bring stability to Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations made by the Australian and other governments along these lines appear to have had some impact on the Cambodian Government's sense of its own responsibilities in this respect. The RCAF must reform and restructure itself if the international community is to have confidence in Cambodia's commitment to reform and if foreign aid is not to be merely a temporary band-aid. A start has been made, but it must be developed and consolidated by the Cambodians themselves, even with substantial external advice and assistance.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The underlying factor in any security assessment of Cambodia is that no area in-country, including Phnom Penh, is absolutely safe. However, some areas are safer than others. Phnom Penh and some provincial towns are the safest, although violent crime is now rife in Phnom Penh. Security in the countryside is uncertain given the potential for rapid change in the security circumstances of any province. Certain areas, for example Banteay Meanchey, Battambang, Preah Vihear, Siem Reap (in the north and north-west) and until recently Kampot (south-west of Phnom Penh), are more dangerous than others, although this too changes over time. (The threat in Kampot currently appears to be reduced by the success of the defection strategy that took place during the final phase of the Wilson abduction. Several hundred KR fighters and their families joined government ranks.) There are threats from sources other than the KR, such as regular acts of banditry, including by members of the RCAF, and a general climate of violence in a society that has endured decades of civil war, the US bombings, the Lon Nol excesses; and the horrors of the "killing fields". However, the KR are the essential security problem, and aid workers and other foreign personnel in the provinces are probably most at risk, particularly if (as KR radio has asserted from time to time) local cadres have been directed to target Westerners. The total number of foreigners in Cambodia is about 10,000, including diplomats, UN employees, aid workers with NGOs and business people but excluding ethnic Vietnamese and Vietnamese workers who number in the tens, if not hundreds, of thousands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are currently 368 Australians registered with the Australian Embassy in Phnom Penh (including some Australian citizens of Cambodian background) of which 38 are based in the provinces. Many of these people work for NGOs dedicated to the betterment of living conditions of the Cambodian people. Often they have many years of experience in Cambodia and are well placed to judge the current security situation on the ground in particular districts. These figures, however, almost certainly understate the true number of Australians in Cambodia at any one time as they do not include unregistered residents, casual travellers, tourists or consultants with international agencies or NGOs who may enter the country for limited periods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">41.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current Consular Travel Advice for Cambodia prepared by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade was issued on 25 November. It emphasises that the security situation is very uncertain and advises that non-essential travel outside Phnom Penh&mdash;with the possible exception of organised trips by air to Angkor Wat&mdash;should be avoided. Australian residents and visitors are urged to register their presence with the Embassy and to seek advice on the current security situation prior to any travel. Previous Consular Travel Advisories issued this year have had as their constant themes the uncertain state of security prevailing in Cambodia and the need for Australian travellers to exercise due care and maintain a very high level of security awareness at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Embassy holds regular security briefings for the Australian community and runs a warden system which facilitates the quick dissemination of relevant information. For those with essential business outside Phnom Penh, the Embassy advises, and itself obeys, good security practices such as only travelling in convoy, seeking armed official protection where necessary and avoiding night-time travel. The Embassy is also in close touch with other diplomatic missions and the United Nations Development Program which provides a security network for the hundreds of employees with UN agencies scattered throughout Cambodia, including in areas of high KR activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the abduction of David Wilson, both the Embassy and AIDAB have made specific arrangements to inform NGO head offices of the increased threat to aid workers who may have cause to travel outside Phnom Penh. A special security briefing, involving several DFAT officers, was held in Canberra on 12 September for NGOs with programs in Cambodia and further briefings will be given as necessary. In implementing Australia's current aid program and planning future activities, AIDAB gives absolute precedence to the safety of staff. This may result in the restriction of some activities in rural areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">44.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we currently believe that Australian Defence Force (ADF) personnel, of whom there are currently 15 in Cambodia (including the Defence Attache and his Assistant), are probably at no greater risk than civilians from the KR, increasing KR radio rhetoric indicates that foreign military advisers would be their preferred targets. ADF personnel, in accordance with the Defence Cooperation Program, are improving the communications system of the RCAF, undertaking demining activities with the Cambodian Mine Action Centre and teaching English to the RCAF. Defence has instituted strict security measures for ADF personnel, which include protection by the RCAF at all work sites. The overall military threat to ADF personnel in Cambodia is currently assessed as medium in Phnom Penh and provincial towns and medium to high in some areas of the countryside. With the announcement of additional military assistance, it is expected that the threat will remain at medium for Phnom Penh and most provincial towns, but may become high in some towns in the north-west. The threat in the countryside is likely to become high. There will likely be a parallel increase in the risk to Australian civilians who live permanently, or undertake necessary periodic travel, outside Phnom Penh.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">45.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regrettably, the safety of Australian nationals (and Canadians for whom Australia has consular responsibility) cannot be guaranteed by the measures outlined in paras 38-40 above. Australians must make their own decisions about safety, travel and work in Cambodia&mdash;doing so with an awareness of the increased risks involved. The Australian Government can provide the type of information they need to make an informed decision, but at the end of the day has no power to prevent Australians from visiting or working in Cambodia.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">46.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, any intimidation of the international community in Cambodia resulting in restriction of assistance programs would be a victory for the KR. Rural Cambodia desperately needs development assistance and the building of infrastructure of every type, including clinics and schools. The KR have shown their true colours when they recently refused to guarantee that the workers of the reputable organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres would be left unmolested. The KR are out to disrupt, discourage or prevent these activities because they know that they can only flourish in a poor and isolated countryside and that rural development will make the KR irrelevant to the life of the peasantry. The recent upsurge in KR abduction of villagers in north and western Cambodia underlines their determination to intimidate locals as well as foreign nationals. Rural development thus holds the key to their ultimate defeat, but such development will not take place without security. The international community must therefore provide Cambodia with assistance in the fields of both development and security. One is not a substitute for the other&mdash;both are essential. The Australian Government is committed on both fronts, and despite the KR's threats to foreigners, will remain committed.</PARA>

Between one and two million people were killed by the KR or died under their rule, and others&mdash;including many of those most needed for the country's development&mdash;fled the country.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">48.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In judging the way Cambodia is dealing with its problems today and how we and the international community can help lift the country out of poverty, turmoil and poor government, it has to be borne in mind that the Cambodian Government, the bureaucracy and the armed forces are just one year old, and made up of factions that were formerly at war with one another. In the post-UNTAC period the Cambodian Government has faced the enormous and urgent task of rebuilding the country from scratch. It is evident that Cambodia will need substantial long term international assistance in this task. The economy needs major structural development and reform. It lacks adequate infrastructure, power and communications; industry and manufacturing, to the extent they exist, are badly run down; the country lacks a skilled and trained labour force; public administration and government is terribly weak; health and education services need to be rebuilt; and the judicial and regulatory systems are virtually non-existent. The situation is further complicated because of inadequate administrative structures, corruption, political uncertainty and real concern about security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">49.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cambodia is fragile and vulnerable and it will remain so for some time. But it is in better shape than it was a few short years ago. The international community will have to give Cambodia time, certainly some years, before it is truly off the danger list. Economic development is the key to long term prosperity of Cambodians and the survival of the government. It is imperative, however, if economic development is to have a chance, that there be security in the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">50.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Gradually pledged international assistance is coming on stream. In 1992/93 the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia (ICORC) noted that multilateral sources (IMF, World Bank, and UN Agencies) had distributed some US$111.4 million. A further US$474 million was distributed from bilateral sources. In March this year, donor governments and agencies pledged a further US$486 million through ICORC for 1994 and US$271 million for 1995. In addition, in May this year the IMF approved a three year structural adjustment facility of US$120 million for Cambodia. Donor governments believe Cambodia should be responsible for receiving and managing aid, and to date have been pleased by the efforts of the Cambodian Government. Understandably, its capacity to absorb large-scale assistance is limited and the international community will need to be patient.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">51.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the magnitude of the problems facing it, Cambodia is making progress. The IMF in a recent review of the Cambodian economy expressed satisfaction with the Government's economic reform and liberalisation measures, and paid tribute to its success in getting a national reconstruction plan launched, in passing a foreign investment law and in improving, tax, customs, trade and public finance procedures. The Fund said Cambodia's economic performance was positive and that it had done well given the constraints it faced. The Fund expressed concern, however, about the slow rate of disbursement of international donor pledges and noted that this was holding up much needed reform in key sectors such as agriculture.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia is already providing Cambodia with assistance under the Defence Cooperation program worth $3 million this year.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The additional defence assistance will focus specifically on training. No Australian personnel will be involved in any support or advisory role during RCAF combat operations. The package will consist of helping the RCAF design an overall training program for its personnel, training RCAF junior officers in Australia as instructors, and providing design assistance and funds so that the RCAF can construct an additional training facility. Some equipment will also be provided for use in training", the Ministers said.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package does not include the provision of lethal materiel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision is in response to the request from the Cambodian Government to Australia and other governments for additional assistance to the RCAF.

Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway and the US, like Australia, all have personnel involved in mine clearance. France has a significant military assistance program, including training of RCAF personnel. The United States is providing humanitarian, demining, construction and road-building assistance. China and Thailand have provided uniforms, with Thailand also offering to provide some civic action and engineering training to the RCAF. Indonesia and Malaysia have also indicated they are prepared to provide training assistance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministers added that the Khmer Rouge, while diminished in strength, remained a serious threat to the efforts of the Cambodian Government to restore peace and provide stability.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Ministers stressed that the security of Australians&mdash;officials, ADF personnel, NGO representatives and private citizens&mdash;remained one of their prime concerns. The Australian Government would not, however, be deterred by threats from outlaws from providing assistance to the legitimate Government of Cambodia. The security situation will continue to be kept under close and continuous review, and special measures would be taken to ensure that Australians in Cambodia were kept fully briefed on changes in the security situation. In this regard, they also encouraged all Australians residing in or visiting Cambodia to consult the Australian Embassy regularly for advice on the latest security assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senators Evans and Ray expressed the hope that Australia's additional assistance would be part of a concerted response from the international community to strengthen Cambodian institutions including in the key area of security, with countries like France and the United States as well as Cambodia's neighbours, continuing to assist with military training and institutional support.</PARA>

<PARA>There is reason for the urgency of today's motion for the suspension of standing orders. It was an extraordinary circumstance to find out, on 14 November 1994, that the annual report of Australian Defence Industries, which plays an important part in Australia's procurement process&mdash;and, of course, it is part of a department which receives an appropriation from the government; it is a fully owned government business enterprise&mdash;was not to be available until one day after the date of the first Defence estimates committee hearing. At that stage I contacted the committee secretary and advised him of this situation. He said he was surprised, and we said that we would like the consideration of Australian Defence Industries to be held over until that report was available which, as I say, was the day after the Defence estimates were due to be considered. It did not happen. I do not know why that message was not passed on, but it did not happen. In the meantime, contacting the secretary again, we were given some assurance that this matter would be revisited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is urgent because there seem to be a number of people who do not understand that there is a change in the way that estimates have been organised: they are now held in conjunction with the financial year, the basis for that being that the budget portfolio reports tendered in estimates are smaller and that we would have the opportunity at the same time to conduct estimates committee meetings in conjunction with the appropriate annual reports, both of the departments and of the various statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only be suspicious that, if a department wants to get out of scrutiny, all it has to do now is leave its annual report until after the conclusion of the estimates process. We can say, `Yes, the legislation committees do have a part in scrutinising those reports.' But if the activities of those departments are involved with, for instance, the sale of a particular statutory body, then some of those activities that are reported on in the annual report ought to be scrutinised at the end of the year before many of those activities take place so that the public has access to that information. It is not good enough in such a committee for us to be told by the minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ADI does not come before the estimates committee or the legislation committee in terms of estimates. However, ADI, putting in an annual report like ASTA&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is also late&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">or anyone else, can come before the legislation committee as part of its normal duties in reviewing annual reports. ADI is not subject to budget subvention and, therefore, is not an appropriate matter to discuss directly before the committee.</PARA>
<PARA>That is incorrect, as I say, for two reasons: firstly, there is an appropriation that goes to ADI; and, secondly, this is now part of the new committee process, as we were led to understand it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If it gets to the point where the minister can decide the level of scrutiny of his department and the statutory bodies, then there is something wrong with this process. That is the reason for the urgency today. This is about whether or not, in this new process, any sticky statutory bodies which wish to avoid scrutiny at this particular moment can do so. As I have said, if we are planning to sell a particular statutory authority with, say, the mechanism of using Australian Defence Industries to get into land lease deals for property development&mdash;perhaps where there is a huge pollution problem, perhaps where the people in Australia ought to know that we might end up with something like an Australia Inc.&mdash;what we need to do is make sure that activity comes under the estimates process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that in this particular process there has been an offer&mdash;out of the goodness of the committee's heart&mdash;that we can possibly get together with Australian Defence Industries to talk about this. But that is not the same as admitting that this is part of the process. We do not want a situation where, in the future, it still can be at the whim of the minister or even of a government controlled committee as to whether or not these annual reports are part of the estimates process. Either they are part of the procedures or they are not. It should not be up to a government controlled committee to decide the level of scrutiny that occurs when dealing with statutory authorities. I urge the Senate to support the motion to suspend standing orders. </PARA>

It will be called on 7 December, and Senator Margetts will get an hour and a half shot at that time to ask it all the questions she likes.' But that did not stop Senator Margetts wasting the Senate's time today. She has a conspiracy theory against ADI&mdash;she thinks it is part of some evil empire.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, it is clear that Senator Margetts wishes to pursue a wide range of questions about the annual report of Australian Defence Industries. That came to the notice of honourable senators a day after we began the estimates inquiry into the Department of Defence. As the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) said in his remarks, it is appropriate to deal with annual reports of statutory authorities when they come up as line item matters within the estimates committee sequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unfortunate that Senator Margetts wanted to raise a wide range of questions that were seen by the committee to be out of sequence and not relevant to issues before the committee at that time. But there was a discussion amongst the committee and it was agreed that, to facilitate Senator Margetts's questions with regard to ADI, the legislation committee, to which all annual reports relating to defence matters are referred, would convene this coming Wednesday at 8 o'clock in the morning to allow the invited representatives of ADI to be present so that any questions arising from the annual report could be raised by honourable senators, including one non-member of the legislation committee, but a participating member, Senator Margetts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Actually, I think that, if Senator Margetts had been patient enough to remain to the end of the estimates meeting, when all of the programs before the committee had been dealt with in order, there would have been a chance for her to proceed with some, if not all, of her questions. I expect that the chairman of that legislation committee, Senator Jones, will speak in a few moments but I believe it would have been possible for the consideration of that annual report to have proceeded at the end of the committee's dealing with all other programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us all be clear: nobody in the Senate today is challenging the fact that statutory authorities must face the scrutiny of the parliament. They do so in an orderly, appropriate way that fits in with all the other concerns for scrutiny that honourable senators have. I believe that, had Senator Margetts been present when program 6 was being discussed, time was available for some of those questions to be put. There was a second chance at the end of the estimates committee hearing to deal with other matters, including the ADI report, but again Senator Margetts was not present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that same legislation committee has made arrangements for a meeting to be held this coming Wednesday. I hope that there is a substantial outcome for the good of Australia and for the good of Australian Defence Industries. I do not know whether it is true that, as Senator Ray has indicated, these questions are entirely insubstantial, self-serving or without sympathy from other honourable senators. We will know that when we actually hear the questions. We were able to hear only one or two on the occasion of the estimates committee hearing. The opposition will not be supporting the motion for the suspension of standing orders. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It seems that some of the facts need to be put on the table, particularly in relation to some of the points raised by Senator Margetts. It has to be understood that the legislation committee that was looking at the estimates was called to look at the defence portfolio. That committee made a decision that it would look at the program under a certain procedure. The procedure that was laid down was that we would look at programs 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. On 15 November we looked at all the programs, except program 5. During the time that we discussed program 6, Senator Margetts could have asked any questions that she wanted to ask in relation to the report. She was not in attendance at that committee meeting. She was in the parliament, but she could not be bothered to attend the meeting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the second occasion the committee met, Senator Margetts said that she wanted to look at a report that had come in after the estimates had started. Let me just read from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> something that Senator Margetts said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I would like to state my complaint. As this was tabled only a day after the estimates and those areas dealt with in Defence procurements now have passed, according to the timetable of the estimates, I would like to lodge my strongest protest that we will not be revisiting the areas which are in the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I spoke to other members of the committee and asked whether or not we should revisit the area. A decision was made by members of the committee that it was better to stick with the program that we had set out. Senator Margetts probably does not know this, but we also had a private meeting that afternoon after she stormed out of the estimates meeting. Again we made a decision and passed a resolution that we would stick to the program as it was set down. Because that was decided, I took the action, as the committee chairman, to follow that program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following that sitting of the estimates, Senator Margetts came to my office yesterday and we talked about what might happen. I suggested that the committee would be inconvenienced but that it would meet on 7 December at 8 o'clock to 9.30 to cover the items that she wanted to cover in relation to the report. I also suggested to her that it was a waste of time to raise this motion before the chamber. It was not until last night that she went back on her word that she was going to leave the motion sit and not do anything with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts decided last night, without indicating to me, that she was going to make her motion formal. It was not until this morning that we received a copy of her motion. It seems to me that she needs the Senate to do what she wants it to do and that she needs the committees to perform in the way that she wants them to so that she can finish off the types of things that she believes are going on. Her inconsistency in not attending the meeting when those matters were being discussed and then in trying to change the estimates committee program to draw in the things that she wants is just an attempt by her to run things the way that she sees them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The committee received 200 questions on notice from Senator Margetts. No doubt the minister and his department will answer those questions. In an attempt to settle the whole matter so that we would not waste the time that we need for legislation in this chamber, the committee has decided to hold that meeting on 7 December to look at the matters that Senator Margetts wishes to look at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I want to take issue with some of what has just been said, in particular the suggestion that some senators' questions are not as valuable as other senators' questions at estimates. That may not have been the intention, but the message that I got was that we can push ahead, knowing that an annual report is not in place, knowing that it has not been put down and therefore cannot be discussed. How can one prepare questions if the key report is unavailable? Some questions may indeed be relevant, but there are probably an awful lot of other questions that need to be asked which simply cannot be put together until one has seen that annual report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand how the committee initially went ahead and closed off that section. I appreciate the fact that the committee is now prepared to re-open it. Therefore, we will not be supporting the motion before us today for the suspension of standing orders. However, we would have supported the original motion being taken as formal&mdash;we indeed indicated that we would do so&mdash;because we believe it is extremely important that all senators have the chance in estimates to raise the key issues that they are concerned about. While I also take issue with the way in which the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) expressed it, he did acknowledge Senator Margetts's very keen interest in this issue, her very keen interest in this particular estimates committee and the fact that she has been pursuing quite a number of these points for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think the committee could have been far better prepared. Knowing that this annual report was not available, surely the committee could have, when deciding its order of business for the day, simply made a point of saying, `Right, we will leave that section entirely out of it, and we will wait until that report is presented.' We all know that estimates are continuing. It surely would have been a very simple solution. We would not have had to go through this today if we simply could have made sure that, when annual reports are not available, those sections of the committee's work are deferred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, while we support the motion being taken as formal, we will not be supporting the suspension of standing orders today. But we think this is a valuable opportunity to put on the record our concerns that all senators must be given an opportunity, if they are participating members or full members of committees, to ask questions when estimates are being examined and preferably to be given the answers at committee meetings. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly to this motion. As the deputy chairman of the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee, I support what has been said by the chairman and other members of the committee in respect of the committee's decision on this matter. I think it is very unfortunate that we have got into this position. With the greatest of respect to the senator concerned, I think there is a degree of misinformation or lack of understanding of the system that is in place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing we must recognise is that, when a legislation committee is dealing with a department the size of the Department of Defence, it is looking at an expenditure of about $10,000 million. That is an enormous amount of money. The Senate and the parliament have the right under our system to inquire, if they wish to do so, as to every cent that is spent. If that is to be responsibly done, it follows that there has to be a sequence to it. Therefore, there is an obligation on the members of the committee to follow some order, some sequence. The committee agreed at the start of the hearing that it would follow the layout in the papers before it&mdash;that we would go through the programs&mdash;and that is what it did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not wish to lecture or to take a position of righteousness on this, but the chairman and I sat through every minute of that hearing. No other member of the committee did that. I find it very hard to be charitable to those who, for whatever reasons, could not afford the time or whose priorities were not high enough to be at the hearing for matters that they now claim are of transcendental importance to them and this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that has to be made is that this is not the only opportunity; this is not the only time in Senator Margetts's life that she has the chance to examine ADI or any department. We have reformed the Senate's committee structure. This legislation committee now has the opportunity, outside hearing estimates, to call before it with due notice any body related to Defence and inquire into what it is doing, what it proposes to do and what money it proposes to spend. I hope that not only the legislative committee dealing with Defence but all legislative committees take this opportunity so that the parliament, particularly the Senate, becomes better informed about the workings of the departments for which we approve expenditure each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Margetts that, firstly, I think she has contributed partly to the unfortunate situation that we are in. Secondly, all is not lost.

In any day in political life, politicians actually lose more issues than they gain. That is the nature of politics&mdash;whether they are in the Liberal Party, the Labor Party or any other party.

I would like to respond to some of the comments made earlier. Senator Robert Ray's comments that, basically, Senator Margetts does not understand is only true in one respect. It is quite apparent that the Senate does not understand the changes made to the estimates process. That is quite understandable, because we have had a big shift. We have moved the budget to the beginning of the year. We have moved the estimates that consider the annual reports to the end of the year.

We are beginning to learn the new processes and it is quite appropriate that we may have some glitches on the way.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Teague said, there is a necessity to clear this up, and that is the reason for the urgency of this motion now. It is necessary to clear it up because estimates are not finished yet. If we have some kind of misapprehension, if Senator Margetts is under some kind of misapprehension, it is obviously urgent that it be cleared up right away. As Senator Jones said, he consulted the committee. The committee agreed with the chairman's response and with the minister's response. It is obvious that the committee members did not understand the new processes for the estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The offering of a committee hearing, far from being charitable or of enormous generosity, was simply an admission of the validity of Senator Margetts's complaint. Why should Senator Margetts not bring to the attention of the Senate a misunderstanding that has arisen that could affect other estimates committees? Let us be clear about this. There is a new process. Senator Coates talked about the introduction of this process. On Wednesday, 24 August, he said that the committees have a broader function. This is, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to ensure a regularised method of referring annual reports to committees. This set of proposals incorporates that system into the responsibility of the legislation committees and suitably simplifies it.</PARA>
<PARA>He also added that this has received a mixed response from committees because of the additional work. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that the specific responsibility for annual reports being given to the legislation committees will see that task given a little more importance, especially with the way in which under the new budget system the annual reports will effectively be the agenda for the additional estimates meetings of legislation committees in, I think, November. So I suspect that with departments and budget dependent agencies the  examination of annual reports will be done in relation to the estimates.</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment, which has been circulated, in effect applies the new structure from the beginning of the next session and provides for a transitional provision to deal with bills which the government wants passed this session, which we have agreed to have debated this session and which were not bills that were introduced during the last session. That transitional provision is in paragraph (5) of the amendment that I have circulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Senate adopts my amendment, the government will be, in effect, bound by the undertakings that it gave on 18 August 1993 when it committed itself to a more orderly programming for the Senate by undertaking to have legislation introduced in one period of sittings for passage in the next period of sittings except in relation to budget bills. It also said that it would seek exceptions in relation to certain other unforeseen or urgent bills. We believe these further exceptions, unforeseen or urgent, should be dealt with in the terms that I have put, which would mean that the government would have to seek the approval of the Senate before it dealt with such a bill in the same session in which it was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be aware, Madam Acting Deputy President, we have for years sought to commit the government to a more orderly programming in this place so that the Senate might function more effectively. We are tired of the process whereby the government introduces large packages of legislation at the end of a session and expects them to be debated in a very short period, because the ultimate result is that the work is not done to the standard that we believe is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have tried a whole series of mechanisms over the years to force the government towards orderly programming, and the undertaking it gave in August of last year was really a commitment that arose as a compromise from the pressures that we had applied. We somewhat reluctantly accepted that compromise because we would have preferred a more strict regime than what had been suggested. Nevertheless, we accepted that in terms of a compromise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take this as the first example of the government implementing its commitment in the course of this session, the performance of the government has been deplorable. There is very little evidence that it has made any attempt whatsoever to meet its commitment and provide orderly programming for the Senate. I will give just a few examples. These figures are now a week or two old but, as of earlier in November, which was at the beginning of week six of 10 weeks of this session, the government had nominated 57 bills for passage before the end of the sittings. Of those 57, 36 had not been introduced into either house at the beginning of the sitting. So almost half of the bills that it sought to have passed this session had not been introduced in accordance with its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By week six only 34 had reached the Senate and, of the 34, only four were on the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> at 23 August&mdash;that is, the beginning of the session. So 34 bills had reached the Senate by the sixth week and only four were bills that were introduced in the previous session. There can be no clearer demonstration of a lack of good faith on the part of the government&mdash;no real attempt to meet its commitment whatsoever. At that stage, three bills listed for passage in these sittings had still not appeared in either house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In those circumstances, it seems desirable for us to meet the spirit of Senator Chamarette's proposal today, which we have redrafted in ways that I have described to make it more workable in the circumstance that we are in at the end of this sitting. What the Senate will now be doing is, by order, imposing a regime on the government. It is regrettable that it seems to be necessary for us to do that in order to expect reasonable performance in programming by this government, but so be it. It has forced it upon itself by its misconduct in this regard. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an amendment to the amendment moved by Senator Hill to Senator Chamarette's motion. This amendment is about to be circulated. It arose out of discussions between Senator Kernot, in particular, and the opposition and, I understand, briefly with the government as well this morning. This is to bring back the exemption for budget related bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish initially to support the thrust of this motion. What Senator Hill is doing is turning what has been orderly arrangements into orderly requirements. The Democrats for a long time have supported looking at the length of time some of the legislation we have before us now needs if we are going to thoroughly scrutinise it. It goes back to the original motions moved by former Senator Michael Macklin on our behalf in trying to make sure that this chamber had adequate time to deal properly with all the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned on this one issue. We cannot go as far as the government's proposed amendment goes, but we can on this one issue of budget related bills, I believe, have a genuine concern that this motion is becoming too restrictive. It would be very difficult in terms of time to have all the bills from the May budget presented before we rose for the winter break in order to debate those when we get back through August, September and October. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I note Senator Hill's concern&mdash;I briefly spoke to him on this amendment&mdash;that `budget related' may indeed be a little wide. I am quite happy to listen to the debate as it proceeds, but I am concerned that, if we cut out `anything related', it also takes out legislation, for example, on Working Nation where there has been considerable warning, considerable public discussion and debate, on an issue where the money is obviously going to come out of the budget. That type of legislation will also be precluded if we just narrowly define this as `budget bills'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am quite happy to listen to any contributions that Senator Hill may have and any concerns that he may express that we are widening it too much, but I do remind Senator Hill, looking through the rest of the wording of his motion, that this chamber would have every right to argue, if the government tried to push this too far, that that bill is simply not directly related to the budget. It may have some slight association with it but not one that this chamber could accept under its definition of a budget related bill. I think we are looking at some grey areas here. This amendment would allow us to go back to looking at a particular piece of legislation and deciding whether in fact it fulfilled all the requirements of this motion. </PARA>

We are now explaining that situations arise where bills are needed. A list has been circulated of the bills that we consider urgent. I mentioned the tax bill. This was originally tax law amendment bill No. 4.&mdash;one bill&mdash;but was split up for constitutional reasons; so it is now a number of other bills. The World Trade Organisation package contains eight bills but is one package of related matters. The World Trade Organisation is supposed to start on 1 January 1995. That is in about 33 days time.

It is not the first time in political history that the far left has got into bed with the far right; and that is the usual arrangement we see in the Senate. We have seen it working consistently. On the land title bill over the last few weeks the Greens have been in cahoots with the opposition and the opposition has been in cahoots with the Greens. Yesterday, we saw the bill deferred for three months while it goes to a select committee with a trumped up, rigged membership. The government has only two members out of, I think, six; and the Greens and the opposition, excluding the Australian Democrats, have the working majority on that committee. They make no bones of the fact that they are going to fix the numbers on that committee to ensure that the land title bill is deferred.

It is quite right to say that, in the end, the way that those opposite are operating as an opposition, in cahoots with the Greens in particular, is only designed to thwart the good management of government legislation through this place. That is what those opposite are about: they know they will not win government in the foreseeable future, so they fall back on the oppositionist mentality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to a double dissolution, clearly, if the Senate becomes unworkable on legislation, the government will use the opportunity to consider having a double dissolution and let the people decide what sort of Senate they want. Do people want the Liberal and National Party coalition dominated by the right wing&mdash;the right wing that knocked Senator Hill over in Boothby&mdash;in cahoots with the Western Australian Greens to create chaos in the Senate? If the opposition wants that to be one of the themes for any future election following a double dissolution, so be it. We will fight it out. I say to the people of Australia that the sort of stunt the opposition is up to today is not about good government or good management in the Senate. It is about the opposition's mentality to do everything possible to frustrate the government because those opposite know they will not be in government in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to emphasise that there are so many bills that come in as urgent matters from time to time and are budget related&mdash;and I appreciate Senator Lees's budget related amendment. We announced in the Working Nation statement earlier this year a number of financial measures that were actually introduced in the budget session. They had to be in order to carry out the policies that were announced by the government. If we had taken the opposition's position, they would not have gone through. We would not have been able to get the major jobs compact program going until the autumn session because that is what the opposition would have imposed on us. So we are saying that Senator Lees's budget related amendment is a very necessary one, which we will support. We believe our amendment, even though we do not like the principle of what the opposition is doing, also adds to the orderly management of government business in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I say to the Senate, the opposition can have a victory on this, but in the end it will lead to a situation where the credibility of the Senate in dealing with government legislation will be at stake. Whether the opposition or the Greens like it or not, we have been elected to government for three years. The people will make their judgment at the end of that term. They expect the government's program to be considered fairly. We have had so much of our legislation referred off to select committees. That is the right of the Senate, and we have copped all of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no excuse that we are rushing legislation through without proper consideration. Any legislation that the opposition wants more time to debate because it has not been able to marshal all its arguments it sends off to a committee. Fair enough: the legislation goes off to a committee for one month or several months before it comes back. We have copped all of that, so there can be no argument that legislation is being rushed through this place without proper consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has to agree that budget-related bills and the bills that we have before us, particularly bills such as the World Trade Organisation Bill, are absolutely essential for Australia's economic wellbeing. The opposition is going to say that in the future we have to come in here and ask for a special exemption for a World Trade Organisation bill to even be listed. I am surprised the opposition would agree to that; I am not surprised the Greens would because they have always opposed such organisations as the GATT round and the World Trade Organisation. We ask the Senate to reject the principle of Senator Hill's motion. If it is carried, we will ask the Senate to support the amendment of Senator Lees and the government's own amendment that has already been circulated. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Schacht calls that a dishonest motive, he is really questioning the honesty of the leader of his government in this chamber. Senator Schacht does not understand that this was a genuine attempt by Senator Gareth Evans after a good deal of discussion, about which Senator Schacht would know nothing, to make the government more accountable in this chamber. This measure would let Australians know the actual details of the legislation as soon as possible and so enable their consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Schacht said about committees was very revealing. His view of committees is: this is just what the opposition, the Greens and the Democrats want to give them time to marshal their arguments against particular legislation. If that is what Senator Schacht thinks, he is pitiably ill-advised. The committee system of this chamber is all about assisting parliamentarians in their representative function, one of the most important of all our functions. How are we going to represent the views of the electors unless they give them to us? And how can they give them to us on a particular piece of legislation unless they know the details of that legislation?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons why I am supporting this, and one of the reasons why the Leader of the Government in this chamber gave that undertaking, is just that: to enable members of the public to know the details of the legislation as soon as possible so that they can then make representations to us, who are then supposed to exercise our representative function on their behalf. That is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why we are arguing about this today. It should be obvious to anybody listening to this debate&mdash;although I hope no-one is wasting time listening to this debate&mdash;that Senator Chamarette's motion and Senator Hill's proposed amendment are perfectly reasonable. Then there is the amendment proposed by Senator Lees regarding budget related measures. There is something in that. But if we are going to judge the actions of the government by what the government's representative said here today, I would not be prepared to support the amendment because, with Senator Schacht's thinking, he would use any excuse to say, `Oh, that's a budget related measure.' There would be nothing to prevent it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the motion moved by Senator Chamarette and the amendment moved by Senator Hill, it is clear that with these measures, which may be a departure from the usual process, the government would have the opportunity of justifying each such departure in debates that conclude with a resolution of agreement by the Senate. Clearly, as I define budget related measures, they, along with other matters raised, such as the World Trade Organisation, would obviously be accepted by the chamber as requiring some urgency. </PARA>

We will win the next election, and I will tell Senator Schacht why&mdash;because the Australian public will realise the massive unemployment problems that exist. Over one-third of people have been unemployed for more than a year. This has created a new underclass. A rapid gap has appeared between the rich and the poor in this country under the Labor Party.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not speak to my motion earlier in an endeavour to save time and also because I was not physically present in the chamber. I had not intended to speak at that point because I spoke yesterday to this motion that I have raised a number of times in this place. That allowed Senator Hill the opportunity to present his amendment to my motion. I am delighted that the opposition has agreed to support the principle that was inherent in my original motion, No. 1197. I believe the opposition amendment adequately addresses the principle underlying my concerns. It puts the government on notice for next year. It supports the orderly process by which legislation should come into this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My own view is that this amendment and also my original motion show up the government's lack of commitment to an orderly process of considering legislation. I do not believe that the successful passage of this motion would be an undue imposition on the Senate. In fact, it will have enormous benefits both to the Senate and to the wider community because it will assist us to scrutinise legislation appropriately and properly and allow the community to respond to it. Successful passage of this motion would also assist ministers in that they would not be able to be dictated to in their program by the people who are drafting legislation. Ministers would have the authority, which is appropriately theirs, to determine their priorities ahead of time within a time frame and to enforce that on the people who draft the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I fear that this government has been too lax in the way in which it has allowed the bureaucratic processes to determine which of the issues it feels are of sufficient importance to be brought in and pushed through right in the final hours of the last session of the parliamentary year. There is obviously a problem. That problem needs to be addressed. The appropriate people to address it are the ministers who wish to introduce legislation. They will know that, if they want legislation to be considered in an orderly fashion, they will need to introduce it in one session and have it considered in the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They will also know that through this motion they will have an avenue of presenting their justification for a bill being dealt with urgently. If it is a valid justification, if there is a valid and legitimate reason for urgent passage, that request will be agreed to by this chamber. The fact that a request is not agreed to would put under question whether the legislation would have gained passage in this chamber. It might save a lot of time if the government knew the extent of scrutiny that would be given to legislation. I have noticed that the government gets support in this chamber for certain legislation. Not only does it prioritise legislation on the basis of its orderly presentation but it prioritises it on a democratic basis. By accepting this motion, legislation which is likely to gain speedy passage will gain speedy passage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Lees also presented an amendment to Senator Hill's amendment. Since I am summing up, I ask rhetorically of Senator Lees: what is a budget bill and what is a budget related bill? This motion does not exclude any bill, whether it is a budget bill or a budget related bill, which has the agreement of the Senate for its consideration. The Senate has repeatedly acknowledged that it accepts the validity of budget bills. I think Senator Harradine's comment was perfectly apt: judging by the performance of Senator Schacht in the chamber, the government is likely to use any device and any kind of loophole to persist in rejecting the legitimate authority and responsibility of the Senate for the Senate's parliamentary program. I say to Senator Lees that if she read the motion fully she would find that the Democrats' amendment is unnecessary. </PARA>

However, as I said, if we look at the Senate program, we could be forgiven for thinking that Senator Gareth Evans did not have a clear intention of honouring his agreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens, the Democrats and the opposition spent a lot of time sitting with the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner) and Minister Robert Ray to reduce that incredible burden from 64 bills, introduced in this sitting and previous sittings, to the current list, which is part of the government amendment, of 24 bills. It has not been from a lack of trying to reduce the program. What was the government planning to do? Was it planning to just roll on through the 12 remaining sitting days and deal with 64 bills? How was it going to determine its priority? Was it never going to approach the Senate to assist it to prioritise what we have left to do in the last remaining days of this parliamentary year? The onus is really on the government to say how it is going to control its own legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht said that the government will never give up the control of government legislation. Nobody is asking it to. We are asking the government to control its own legislation and to do so in an orderly fashion so that it can justify the list it produces in this chamber and gain the appropriate debate it deserves. If the government had demonstrated any resolve at all in relation to its commitment to manage the bills in an orderly way, this motion would have been unnecessary&mdash;we would not even be discussing it now. The government still has the right to control its legislation and it has the responsibility to do that in an orderly and good-management approach. Good management demands that the program proceeds for the benefit of the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a double responsibility here. Senator Schacht mentioned the mandate a government gains at a three-yearly election. A government mandate by election is not a carte blanche. Nothing can deprive the government of its responsibility when it is elected for its own legislative program. Nevertheless, it has an accountability to the people. The only way that accountability can be exercised between elections is via the bicameral parliamentary democracy that we have here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said yesterday, the government has become a little arrogant in the use of executive power. It has become a little arrogant about its use of numbers in the House of Representatives. It has forgotten that, for the last 10 years, it has not had the numbers in the Senate to push through its legislation in the same unseemly way it does in the House of Representatives. It has a responsibility to this chamber as well as its election responsibilities. The responsibility in this chamber is not to us; it is to the people of Australia who elected the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's responsibility to present the legislation in this chamber in such a way that it can be debated and have community scrutiny, and so that the people who debate it can be well informed about its impact.

The second part is the Senate's responsibility to do its job properly and to allow adequate time for scrutiny and community response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge the people who are not supporting my motion and the opposition's amendment to read the motion. As I said, I do not agree that the Democrats' amendment is necessary, but I feel that this motion and its amendment certainly is necessary. I can assure the Senate that the Greens have a continuing commitment to making sure that adequate community consultation, proper debate and thorough scrutiny of bills take place in this chamber of this parliament. Over time, the numbers gained in the lower house have led to a total absence of informed and critical debate in that place, and crude political posturing adds little to the law-making process of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report I am tabling today is the committee's unanimous report on the provisions of the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Bill 1994 as referred to the committee by the Selection of Bills Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the classification of films, publications and computer games. It constitutes the Commonwealth's contribution to revising the current censorship laws in co-operation with the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">After receiving the reference from the Selection of Bills Committee the committee wrote to each of the State and Territory Ministers responsible for censorship matters and invited their comments on the Bill. Responses received from the Censorship Ministers for Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory indicated that the Commonwealth had fully consulted with the States and Territories in the development of the Bill and that the Bill had received their support. The co-operative nature of the Bill was influential in the committee recommending that the Bill be agreed to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the subject matter of the Bill was not new to the committee, it having previously made recommendations about the classification process in its October 1993 report entitled Report on Video and Computer Games and Classification Issues. In particular, the committee was concerned about the lack of responsiveness of the classification system to current community standards and it made a number of recommendations to better involve the general community in the process. While the Bill meets one of the committee's concerns by increasing the number of members of the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board, the Government's response to the committee's other recommendations did not adequately explain their exclusion from the Bill. Therefore the committee has repeated its earlier recommendations for further consideration by the Attorney-General and anticipates that the Attorney-General will consult with his State and Territory colleagues and will address these recommendations in the Government's response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the committee received representations from the Video Industry Distributors Association (VIDA) seeking exemption from the classification system of "G"-rated films and videos containing depictions of classical music and sport. Representatives of VIDA appeared before the committee on 20 October to give oral evidence in support of their proposals. The committee saw VIDA's representations as uncontentious, although officers of the Attorney-General's Department advised the committee that the Standing Committee of Censorship Ministers had not agreed to VIDA's suggestions. The committee understands that negotiations between the parties are continuing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this debate was previously adjourned, I was in continuation. I had been reminding the Senate that the government in 1992 had conducted a youth summit and that a document had been presented and commented on, and I quoted from it. The Prime Minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to problems raised by a number of delegates at the national meeting, the government is announcing today an initiative to support and simplify the income support arrangements for unemployed young people.</PARA>
<PARA>Included in those initiatives was the reduction from 26 weeks to 18 weeks in the time required for income support recipients under 18 who have lived away from home before becoming eligible for the higher, independent rate of payment. I pointed out to the Senate that the government had taken notice of that, had spent $0.4 million and benefited approximately 2,100 young people. It now intends to welsh on that promise and change that waiting period back to 26 weeks. We will oppose that and we will introduce an amendment which reinstates the original definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that employment opportunities for young people have not significantly improved since that time. In 1992, prior to the youth summit, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for young people between 15 and 19 years of age who were looking for full-time work stood at some 35.8 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the three years since November 1991 this monthly figure has dropped below 30 per cent on only five occasions. At the moment it still stands at 28 per cent. We would suggest that that figure demonstrates the need to keep in mind the importance of this particular group of young people. The government has offered no justification for expanding that waiting period back to 26 weeks. We see every justification for maintaining it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will seek to replace the proposed definition of `homeless', which is listed as `unreasonable to live at home' in the youth training allowance legislation, with that of the current definition contained in the Social Security Act. I return to the theme that I spoke about at some length before, that this is a case of consistency. A large part of what this bill is about is shuffling great, bulky pieces of legislation out of one act and into a new one. If we are going to do that, we should at least be consistent with existing things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is acknowledged generally that the proposed definition that is based on the current Austudy definition is somewhat harsh and more stringent. I quote from a recent report by the Institute of Family Studies, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Family Matters</EMPHASIS>. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wording of the corresponding Austudy requirements suggest that life in the parental home needs to be somewhat more intolerable before homelessness is recognised. The homeless rate of Austudy is paid when conditions at home would pose a threat to the physical or psychological health of the applicant, including situations of serious domestic violence, sexual harassment, extreme family breakdown or other exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>We appreciate arguments by the government for consistency, but we fail to see the benefits of this renewed definition which has more stringent criteria in order for young people to qualify as independent. Having said that, we support the insertion of an away-from-home provision for young people. Of course, this will depend on certification by DEET that the young person needs to live away from home for jobsearch or for training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I found it interesting that the government, in sharing some information with my office yesterday, expected that 20 per cent to 25 per cent of youth training allowance recipients will be homeless. I hope that is wrong because it would alarm me, given that one aim of this legislation is to tighten or clarify the homeless criteria, if we are left with the same number of young people defined as homeless as there are at the moment because approximately 24 per cent of 13- to 17-year-olds receiving jobsearch allowance, sickness benefit or the special benefit also receive the youth homeless allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder what `homelessness' means for a trainee. If a quarter of trainees are homeless, perhaps we should spend a bit more energy on addressing that problem. I think you would share with me, Mr Acting Deputy President, knowledge that a person defined as homeless would hardly be an ideal subject for a traineeship. The disadvantages faced by such a person would mitigate greatly against successfully completing a traineeship. I really wonder what we mean when we say `homeless'. We might discuss that a little more in the committee stage, but I raise that problem now and explain that it will be the subject of our second amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the punitive attitude and pejorative language in the legislation about how young people will be treated and about the attitudes and assumptions of the government. Obligations are being lumped onto the youth side and the government has failed to define the consequent and parallel obligations it has&mdash;obligations which should see the government accepting some responsibility for the situation as it is and recognising that it is not all the fault of the young people of this country. If we are talking about pathways, there is not only some obligation to enforce young people to follow a certain path, but also an obligation on the government to see that there is something fruitful and productive&mdash;in other words, a job&mdash;at the end. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think Senator Bell hit the nail on the head. The key issue we should be talking about is jobs. Although there will be general support for the idea that young people should be either studying or training if they are unemployed, these student assistance bills raise problems of logic and equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a start, let us recognise, as Senator Bell mentioned, that the problem is unemployment&mdash;not training. No amount of training will create jobs which are not there. Perhaps some honourable senators will recall the television program, shown some time back, which showed a young woman from Burnie with certificates from all sorts of training courses&mdash;and she still had no job. In that regard, I note with interest the basic criticism by the Welfare Rights Centre that the problem is unemployment and that all this legislation, which is transplanted social security legislation, should be left in the Social Security Act. That is the view of that organisation. Indeed, it is rather bizarre to read the pages of legislation which deal with bereavement through death of a partner or withdrawing money from a superannuation fund, and then remind yourself that all this is about under 18-year-olds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to change the name, fine, it can. I suppose I can handle, as can others around the place, a new set of acronyms. But let us not kid ourselves as to what this is all about: it is about unemployment benefits for under 18-year-olds; that is what it is about. There is a real danger of wasting taxpayers' money on myriad courses which are nothing more than credentialism. Tourism is a very important industry and a fast growing area of employment. It is important, of course, for training schemes to continue in that particular area and be supported strongly. But people do not need to have university degrees to learn how to serve meals or work in the tourist industry at that particular level. It is handy, of course, to have languages in the tourist industry if you are to be face to face with the public and not doing up rooms and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let us face it: what people want is work, not mickey mouse courses. We have to realise that young people are individually very different. Those of us with families know that each individual child, young person, teenager, young man or young woman is unique; not one of them is the same. Honourable senators ought to get around our tea table at night and they then would know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great failure of the green and white papers on unemployment was in their not addressing fundamental issues, such as pressures on labour force participation rates&mdash;even though the Treasurer (Mr Willis) has publicly admitted that the increased rates of participation in the work force of mothers with young dependent children make it awfully difficult to get the unemployment rate down. That is what Minister Willis has said. In this regard, it is disappointing that the government has not addressed the issues posed by some of its commissioned work which pointed to the pressures created by the taxation system on families, which force them to seek second incomes, even when they would otherwise prefer to have one parent at home. It is a disgrace; it is an indictment on us all&mdash;on the government in particular&mdash;that nowadays the average family needs two incomes whereas previously one income was sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is most cynical; one could say that the measure currently before us is another exercise in massaging the unemployment figures. Some will say that the government is trying to massage the unemployment figures by pushing young people to stay on to year 12, go to university or get training&mdash;anything to get them off the unemployment rolls. I have asked the Australian Statistician in estimates processes how he will classify people on the youth training allowance. If the Australian Statistician says that people will be classified as being out of the work force and thus not unemployed, then the cynics regrettably will be proved right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other fundamental policy problems with the bill. The bill imposes means tests on young people on the basis of their parents' income and assets. Presumably, the logical basis for this approach is that the parents' income and assets can be regarded as being available to support the young person. Yet, when it comes to taxing the family, the parents are treated as though they had no dependants. This is just another example of the institutionalised hypocrisy which permeates government policies on families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the question of family income transfers that can be used to save the Treasury money, families are recognised. But when recognising family responsibilities and family income support that would cost the Treasury money, forget it. Forget the International Year of the Family; forget the slick ads and logos that we have seen on television. What the government is really about is screwing every cent it can out of ordinary families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will take another example. There is no allowance for family size in these income and assets tests. We know how the government knocked off the so-called sibling concession which treated a family with more than one student the same as a family with one student. It is repeating that here. There is no allowance in the income test for the number of family members, and there is no allowance in the assets test for the number of family members. Yet the Medicare levy recognises the obvious. It has thresholds which increase with family size. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this bill, if a person is married or in a de facto relationship, the parental income test does not apply; he or she is independent. Yet the government has said that Austudy claimants in similar circumstances who are married will not be recognised as independent from 1 January 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It bugs many families when the government rabbits on about income support for families or young people. Who pays the bills? Who pays the mortgage or the rent? By and large the families do. No-one else. Yet the government consistently ignores this vast, voluntary, private redistribution of income. It does not recognise it in the taxation system, so all families with children are discriminated against. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every week, many more billions of dollars flow to families from workers' pay packets than from any social security payment. Yet these workers get no relief and no recognition from the tax system for what they are doing in saving the Treasury a bundle, as well as raising its future taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I repeat one of the major points that I am concerned about. If the government sees this as an attempt simply to massage the unemployment figures and if, as a result, the statistician classifies these people on the youth training allowance as not being unemployed&mdash;as being out of the work force&mdash;this is a con job. I will be very interested to hear what the statistician says in response to my questions in the estimates committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the proposed amendments, it is not for me to speak on those at this juncture. Hopefully, I will contribute to the committee stage of the debate although, as I mentioned in a previous debate, if this bill is still in the committee stage tomorrow morning, by a decision of this Senate, I will be at a meeting of the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, of which I am a participating member, in respect of a matter that is of importance to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is one of the reasons why I think we have to look at the problem of committee meetings taking place at times when the Senate is meeting, particularly when the Committee of the Whole is considering a very important bill such as we have here. The alternative to that is to receive the gift of bi-location which, in my case, I do not think would be necessarily appreciated by honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Student Assistance (Youth Training Allowance) Amendment Bill has so many problems with it that it is hard to know where to start. There are two major areas of problems. The first is the way the government has legislated for case management and the rules governing the youth training allowance. The second is the unworkable administration of this new allowance because of DSS and DEET anomalies. Today we should try to alleviate both of these problem areas because, if we do not, it is inevitable that the ones who will lose out, as usual, will be our young unemployed people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concept of the bill is about changing the name of a training program and pretending that it is a job placement program. There are three reasons for saying that: firstly, it serves the mass processing of clients into training programs and therefore off the unemployment figures, as Senator Harradine mentioned; secondly, it is a paternalistic and short-term approach to the futures of young people, which is meant to give the impression that the government is helping youth to find jobs; and, thirdly, it funds a number of public and private organisations that can cream off their commissions, which are incentives to churn through more clients in a shorter period of time. Once again, the government has wrecked a good idea by building into a program measures that promote the domination of economic efficiency as a criteria for service provision at the expense of quality. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The youth training allowance scheme is paternalistic because in many cases youth will be forced into jobs they do not want but which are instead most convenient for case managers. The case managers will probably be just out of school or university themselves as the government is embarking on a large graduate recruitment in the new year. The economic efficiency measures and the sheer number of cases per person mean that quality time and planning, counselling, and pre-vocational and self-esteem work will be pushed aside. The scheme will therefore not promote different, more caring and equitable ways of dealing with youth but will seek to enhance the already paternalistic style of employment advice used by the CES. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our young people are very aware of the power structures in the administration of employment systems. It is a complete power imbalance where they are constantly told what they should be doing, as in a parent-child relationship, instead of having their empowerment and sense of choice over their future facilitated by a relationship between functioning adults. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a situation of factory farming people into jobs or training to pull them off the unemployment statistics the fastest and cheapest way possible, the priority becomes that of picking those who are already suitable for vocational training or jobs. This is not necessarily what our young and deeply disadvantaged unemployed people are ready for. The scheme is meant to help the long-term employed, and although length of unemployment is a barrier to employment, it is really the culmination of a whole lot of other barriers that work against a person. Some of these barriers are: ethnicity, age, language skills, isolation from the culture of work, personal development and self-esteem, drugs and alcohol abuse, homelessness and family problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people make up the deeply disadvantaged group in the labour market. Will this scheme help them? They require a focus on personal development and pre-vocational training to prepare them for training and eventual work but, because there will not be any immediate statistical result, they will be put in the too hard basket. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its recent research report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Down, but not out: helping people most deeply disadvantaged in the labour market</EMPHASIS>, ACOSS found that the best way to help this deeply disadvantaged group was a two-year work plan to get them ready for work. Without this kind of concentration on the deeply disadvantaged, ACOSS says that simple labour market programs will continue not to help them. Instead, what happens again and again with the introduction of new labour market programs is that the 20 per cent of those who are work-ready and who need only a slight skills upgrade are those who are creamed off the surface of the unemployment problem and put to work. I fear that, without some real thought, this new scheme will have exactly the same results. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect that case managers will largely take the role of referring people due to the large case loads they will have to handle. They will not have the time to sit down with people, counsel them on a personal level and help them identify their personal problems and obstacles to finding the training that suits them the best or the mode of work for which they are suitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many will have personal obstacles to work to deal with, and they will have to be given the support to deal with these issues in time. Even though this caring and holistic approach can be more frustrating at times, there is no point in shoving them into jobs that they will not like or that they are unsuited for and then cutting off their only means of support if they later quit or refuse to do the work up-front. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also believe it is essential that case managers be properly trained to deal with these people in a caring manner. They need to be able to employ strategies for young people to come to their own conclusions and determine their own employment and training needs. Without this, we cannot succeed in the empowerment of the youth in our society, which is what they need most at that vulnerable age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of case manager training, it is very important that they do not view the young unemployed with disdain and that they maintain a positive attitude towards them. The attitudes of case managers will invariably govern their behaviour towards our young people. They should not blame the victim when it comes to unemployment. As we know, unemployment is the consequence of a complex array of trade, financial speculation and multinational forces that lead to a structural unemployment that no amount of training can change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much attention needs to be paid to alternative training schemes or skills that people will need that may lead to self-sufficiency, such as self-employment and cooperative or group enterprises. There are plenty of obstacles in this legislation to stop people turning down this road. The government should have dealt with the problems I have outlined by softening the paternalistic approach and by having a decent appeals process built into the new YTA system. Alas, this is not the case. The review process is the same&mdash;through the slow working appeals tribunal already in place&mdash;but it will have a heavier workload from reviewing challenges to the activity agreements which are sure to cause problems if case managers assert their will over our youth who need care and time to decide what is best for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am concerned that there is not ample flexibility to vary an activity agreement. There needs to be a built-in principle that such an agreement can be changed and there needs to be a fair process of changing it and appealing the outcomes of those negotiations. It is essential that young people are actively involved in the negotiation of the agreement and that it is not forced on them in a passive position to which they can say yes or no. The bottom line is that there is no opportunity to say no when people are going to lose their only means of support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to look at what sort of outcome we want for our young people out of this new program. Do we want to shove them off the unemployment statistics for a bit to make the government look better for the next election? Or do we want to put them into a six-month training program and then forget about them? Or do we need to integrate these job training programs, which are dressed up as job placement programs, with real job creation programs to give these kids a chance? At the end of the day, this new program will not help a thing if no new jobs are created. We can blame the victim as much as we like, but the bottom line is jobs&mdash;private and public sector jobs, self-employment and group and cooperative enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is also important that training programs are not seen as an end measure but as a stepping stone for our young people to acquire the skills they need to get on in life. That will add to their life focus and life-long process of learning. Young people also need follow-up support after training, and case managers should be offering their services for the benefit of young people and not just to gain the most funding they can from this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we are legislating on how to deal with people who strike or lose their jobs voluntarily, we need to emphasise the importance of post-placement counselling. This will keep people in their jobs, work against employee discrimination and help the person acclimatise to the culture of the job and organisation. I fear this will not be a priority for overburdened case managers. In the future we would like to see more emphasis on real job creation and more programs such as the new enterprise scheme and jobskills, which are really about employment and learning, not just about decoration which runs the risk of disempowering our young people in the early stage of their life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the problems of the departments in sorting out how to administer this bill. This bill is governed by DEET legislation which is to be administered by the DSS. This is an unhealthy compromise between two ministers who fought over the youth training allowance. We know that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean) won but, egos out of the way, the people who will suffer as a result of this situation will be our unemployed young people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The benefit to the government of putting DSS legislation through the DEET wringer means that definitions are narrowed to DEET standards and fewer people can qualify over independent and away from home rates of allowance. These definitions need to be urgently amended because the DEET definitions are unduly harsh in these areas. The government can keep on with its rhetoric about consistency between DSS and JSA as long as the harsher DEET standards are aligned with DSS criteria&mdash;not the other way round. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point about the two departments sharing the youth training allowance is that there will be lots of buck passing and lower levels of accountability and efficiency. This point has already been experienced by recipients of the formal training allowance, which was a small allowance of only $40 a week, as it had notorious administration problems caused by DSS acting as an agent for DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of moving this legislation back to DSS and out of DEET's hands, I propose a motion that after 12 months of the program running, on 1 January 1996, the government review the administration of the youth training allowance and produce a report looking into the transfer of that part of the Student Assistance Act which deals with YTA by amendments to the Social Security Act.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is clear from Senator Bell's comments that the Democrats wish to drive a wedge between the government and the community groups. That might be a bit harsh, but that is what struck me in some of the comments Senator Bell made in his contribution to debate on this bill. Despite these comments, the government was pleased to reach a consensus with the National Union of Students on the matters raised. Additionally, the government has addressed all the other matters raised. Senator Bell criticised the bill, saying it restricts the situations where a young person can qualify as being independent. The government considers that, in general, young people should be supported by their parents unless it is clearly not appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the government recognises the difficulties faced by low income families who are supporting a young person who needs to live away from home. To meet this issue, the youth training allowance introduces an away from home rate which at present is $222.10 a fortnight. The maximum away from home rate is the same as the maximum independent rate, but it is subject to parental means testing. There is no waiting period for the away from home rate, unlike the independent rate for the jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issues of homelessness. The proposed legislation will remove a provision enabling a young person to qualify as homeless if the parents do not let the person live at home. This provision is too broad and is susceptible to abuse and rorting. The present legislation provides that a young person can qualify as independent if he or she cannot live at home because of extreme family breakdown. I trust in this area we will not get some of the exaggerated claims that have occasionally come, unfortunately, from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has consulted with the Morris committee on youth homelessness about the homeless criteria. The government accepts the committee's view that the youth training allowance criteria should apply across-the-board. The present legislation will make the same definition of homelessness apply for sickness allowance and special benefit. The government is looking at changing the Austudy rules to the same as the youth training allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will make some comments in response to remarks made by a number of honourable senators in their contributions in the second reading debate. Senator Troeth asked what kind of  training young people will receive. It is a requirement of the proposed legislation that a young person receiving the youth training allowance will be approved for training only if this is likely to improve his or her employment prospects. Where young people have assistance from a case manager, this will help them make realistic choices about education and training that is most likely to qualify them for employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, it is not possible to guarantee a young person that the training will necessarily lead to employment. Senator Bell may be unrealistic in suggesting that the government guarantee people paid employment as a result of their participating in the youth training initiative. However, the government is committed to providing major resources to assist young people entering the labour market. These include the youth training initiative and additional entry level training places. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth and Senator Bell referred to concerns expressed by the Welfare Rights Centre on why DEET has been given responsibility for the youth training allowance. I think Senator Margetts may have touched on similar points in her remarks just completed. The youth training allowance is an essential part of the youth training initiative, which was announced as part of the white paper on employment and growth. The youth training initiative provides intensive case management, giving clients the assistance of a specific case manager in the search for work, training or education opportunities; a labour market or vocational training program placement for those who remain unemployed six months after registering; and income support by way of the youth training allowance, which is the subject of the present bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has given DEET the policy responsibility for the youth training initiative and so for the youth training allowance as part of this. This new arrangement will lead to greater emphasis than previously on income support as integrated into a process leading to employment or employment related outcomes. It will also involve increased cooperation and program delivery between the relevant departments. The new closer administrative arrangements are reflected already in moves to have a common definition of the criteria for homelessness and the proposal to have one appeals tribunal, the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, to review appeals concerning social security payments, youth training allowance and student assistance payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, clients will find that the delivery of the youth training allowance will be the same as for the jobsearch allowance. The Department of Social Security will be the payment agency handling grants, ongoing payments matters and benefits control aspects. The Department of Employment, Education and Training will handle labour market matters such as labour market assessment and labour market program placements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth and Senator Bell also referred to comments by the Welfare Rights Centre that the proposed legislation is unduly complex and that the youth training allowance should have been established by amending the Social Security Act rather than the Student Assistance Act. The placement of the youth training allowance in DEET legislation reflects the view that the youth training initiative is best located in the employment, education and training portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is simplistic to suggest that all income support legislation should be placed in the Social Security Act. There is a range of legislation dealing with income maintenance located in different portfolios. Income for students is already in legislation in the employment, education and training portfolio. Income support for farm households is in the primary industry portfolio. Health care cards are covered under legislation in the health and human services portfolio. In any event, lawyers and others who give legal advice to young people about income support would already have to have access to both the Social Security Act and the Student Assistance Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were NUS concerns that departmental officers will be appointed to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. Already DSS officers are appointed to the SSAT. Departmental members are appointed because of their knowledge of departmental operations. Their role is to draw the tribunal's attention to relevant legislation and matters impinging under departmental administration. They are on full-time secondment to the tribunal and are regarded as being on leave without pay from the Australian Public Service for the duration of their appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that DEET staff who may be appointed to the tribunal compete on merit. If successful, they will not represent DEET but must act impartially. In discussions between the NUS and the minister, the NUS agreed that it would monitor the role of DEET officers and report back to the minister if it considered that there were problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerns by NUS about the differential between the Department of Social Security student assistant waivers were raised with the government. The briefing I have is that the intention was that the restructuring of the appeal provisions should be cost neutral. However, the government has given the NUS an undertaking that we will look at this issue in the budget context. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, the government appreciates the comments made by the NUS. Discussions between the minister and the NUS have resolved concerns raised by the NUS to its satisfaction. As far as the government is concerned, there are now no outstanding issues between the NUS and the government on these issues. Therefore, the government believes that it has given proper and lengthy consultation to the community. We have heard those views, responded accordingly, and given those undertakings which are now in the second reading reply that I have just given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, we believe that the amendments to be moved by Senator Margetts are not supported, especially the second reading amendment she has just explained.

Senator Schacht may have an explanation for that, but that structure was put in place to avoid this sort of situation. It was put in place to try to ensure better processing of legislation.

We do not, in any way, support the provision of lethal military assistance to Cambodia. The current problems in that country will not be ameliorated by the provision of military equipment or ammunition. Indeed, it is quite possible that the provision of Australian military hardware and ammunition would only complicate the strife in Cambodia. We know that it is reported that Thailand is not happy at the prospect of any military assistance being given to Cambodia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out also that our other ASEAN neighbours have not exactly been rushing in to provide military aid themselves. Indeed, it is interesting to note in the ministers' press release&mdash;this is a very wishy-washy statement, I suggest&mdash;that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Indonesia and Malaysia have also indicated they are prepared to provide training assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>There are no details. There is no announcement from Indonesia and Malaysia. We are not told what they have indicated they are prepared to provide or when, or whether it will be contingent upon something else happening. That is not very impressive. From the contact I have had with defence people from ASEAN countries, I know that the view of their governments is that economic assistance is of some value to Cambodia and military aid could well be counterproductive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Australian government has been rushing in to perhaps keep Gareth Evans and his baby going, but the rest of the region has not been leading the way. It is intriguing that since last July we seem to have been spending time canvassing support to try to get other nations to come in with us&mdash;of course, this has not been announced in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that a paper which was released recently by the Australian Defence Studies Centre pointed out that there are a number of compelling reasons to categorically rule out the supply of lethal aid to Cambodia. Those reasons included: that civil aid measures would be more effective in combating the Khmer Rouge; that the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces do not appear sufficiently competent to defeat the Khmer Rouge in battle; that there is little confidence that the RCAF will respect human rights; that lethal aid would also give rise to corruption and possible onward sales of Australian weapons and equipment to the Khmer Rouge; and that lethal assistance appears to be unnecessary given that there is adequate material already in Cambodia. In fact, only this week our ambassador in Cambodia was reported as having said that the most valuable aid for Cambodia is civil aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On page 12 of the statement the ministers refer to Australian aid. They spell out the details of the civil development aid commitment, which is $92 million over the next four years. Our aid program was ranked sixth in 1993 after France, the United States, Sweden and the Netherlands. The aims of that program are to promote good governance, foster political and social stability, provide for poverty alleviation, and promote sustainable economic progress and human resource development&mdash;all worthy of achievement and certainly worth trying for. I believe that our best hope is to give this sort of assistance to Cambodia for its long-term future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that a more acceptable military aid approach to Cambodia should focus on the provision of training with a guarantee that Australia will not become involved in combat operations there. I am very concerned about two reports in today's newspapers. There is an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> by David Lague and another in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Karen Middleton, both of which appear to have been written based on briefings that they had received. Both of those articles are very similar in tone. One article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is believed fewer than 10 Australian military personnel will now be sent to train battalions in Cambodia. Sources said the mode of training was likely to be similar to Australian-run training in Vietnam but that Cambodian battalions would not be sent out on operational exercises in areas where they are likely to encounter the Khmer Rouge.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose that is a godsend. The only thing is that their job is to encounter the Khmer Rouge, I would have thought. The other article states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Army's training specialists would decide how many instructors were needed after designing a training program for the Cambodians. The Army will use a similar system to that used during the Vietnam War, when instructors worked closely with South Vietnamese units to improve their ability to fight a counter-insurgency war.</PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Vietnam, Australian advisers and instructors played key roles in assisting the South Vietnamese on operations and the danger of this happening in Cambodia has alarmed the Opposition.</PARA>
<PARA>You betcha! It has. Surely to goodness, this country can learn lessons from history. Gareth Evans, for one, was marching in the streets of Australia protesting about sending young men to the killing fields in Vietnam. Yet somebody is countenancing&mdash;because these briefings appear to have occurred to at least two defence journalists&mdash;that the training proposed is comparable to the training role of those advisers of the AATV in the early days in Vietnam. I am informed that that is not the case. But somebody has been briefing defence journalists. I say to the government now, in the Senate, in the parliament of Australia, that the opposition will be relying on the commitments given by the government today and we will be holding the government accountable. This is not to be a swamp into which young Australians are dragged with early assurances that that is the only assistance&mdash;and then the reality becomes very different later on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that Australia's aid should focus on the provision of resources to train RCAF personnel in mine clearance. We acknowledge that some work has been done already. But less than half of one per cent of the mines in Cambodia have been cleared, although there has been substantial input from other countries as well as Australia. Until such time as the farming land in Cambodia is cleared, the economy has no hope of getting up and running again. If we want to help Cambodians, it is vitally important that we help them clear their mines. Resources can also be appropriately allocated to assist the RCAF in an appropriate reform plan for their forces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also appropriate that we should bring RCAF officers to Australia for training. It is practical. They learn by  example. It is less likely to involve our own troops in a dangerous and very unstable environment. By bringing them back here, they can see what happens in another country where an army is subject to a democratic government and where our army is not corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having outlined the forms of assistance we believe Australia could provide to Cambodia, it is also time to point out that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) and the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) should get together and give the Australian parliament and people some explanation of Australia's defence and security interests in Cambodia. While this statement released today goes some way towards establishing the reason for Australia's provision of assistance, I believe the defence minister at least should provide a more in-depth account of how the security situation in Cambodia is relevant to Australia's security.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The six lines which outline our national interests in providing assistance to Cambodia are inadequate. Can we seriously expect that the Australian parliament and people should be fobbed off with such cursory treatment of such a vital issue? Does the government believe that the instability in Cambodia represents a possible threat to Australia and its people? Does Labor secretly harbour fear of a domino effect resulting from the strife in Cambodia? I am old enough to remember Labor scoffing at the domino theory before, but that can be the only explanation, surely, for it saying that our national security interests are involved in Cambodia and that there is potentially a threat to Australia and its people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a look at the statement, it is interesting to see what a great deal of obviously defence initiated information and detail there is on the assessment of the Khmer Rouge. Compare that with what I presume is the foreign affairs department's assessment and its lack of detail on our national interest and it highlights the reason why I say we have not been given a proper assessment; and the Australian people deserve better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like the government to clarify the somewhat ambiguous statement contained in paragraph 5 of the press release that outlines the nature of the Australian aid package. What does the government mean by saying, `Some equipment will also be provided for use in training'? It could mean anything. I am informed that this means webbing and training aids, all of which, I am sure, the Khmer Rouge will be truly grateful for. But the statement is not specific and it leaves the government's options open in the future to change the equipment that it currently claims it is intending to send. I want that detail on the public record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the government decided not to increase the level of assistance for mine clearance when that is of such importance to the future economic well-being of Cambodians? The statement pays almost no attention to the corruption that is rife in the RCAF or, for that matter, in the government. It mentions it once in passing. Why is this? It is an unfortunate fact that the government wishes to ignore this, presumably, as it seeks to assist in the rehabilitation of the RCAF. But if Australia is to help with the reform, surely this matter needs to be dealt with in greater detail by the government. It needs to be acknowledged because it is basic to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition also wants to know where most of Australia's in-country assistance will be located in Cambodia. The assessment in the statement about the possible danger to ADF personnel is serious and should be treated seriously. Can the Australian government give the parliament the assurance that the ADF personnel on the ground in Cambodia will be adequately protected by the RCAF? We do not really have much justification for being confident in the ability of RCAF personnel to defend our troops sent there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today's statement argues that the Khmer Rouge is not likely to expand its areas of control and influence over the long term. Elsewhere in the paper there is an argument that the strength of the Khmer Rouge combat force is in the decline with the numbers being 8,000 to 10,000 in the field, with 5,000 of these being hard-core fighters. I remind the government that some 30,000 guerillas in Greece were able to tie up eight divisions of crack German troops for much of the Second World War. Closer to home, 6,000 guerillas were able to tie up 300,000 British, Australian and New Zealand forces, police and home guard forces, during the Malayan emergency for more than 10 years. They were all well trained.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Malaya there was the incomparable advantage of having a democratic system of government, a well ordered society, good infrastructure and villagers prevented from resupplying the terrorists. None of that can be said to be the case in Cambodia; therefore, the prospects for the RCAF in dealing with the guerillas is that much worse. Although the Khmer Rouge may be declining in numbers, it still has a greater potential for war than this report admits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the Senate's attention to some of the statements about the current military situation which I think should be highlighted. The government acknowledges that the Khmer Rouge: . . . poses a severe security problem for the government and this problem is likely to continue in one form or another unless the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces (RCAF) are made more effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A heightened guerilla campaign . . . in the coming dry season cannot be ruled out. This is following an established pattern of skirmishing, guerilla hit-and-run tactics and terrorist attacks. This is common in guerilla wars. The Khmer Rouge is capable of conducting this sort of campaign for some years. It aims to regain sole power by destabilising&mdash;politically, economically and militarily&mdash;through protracted insurgency. It is conducting a campaign to damage infrastructure, harass RCAF forces and discourage economic development to raise revenue through trade in timber and gems and through bandit activity, including hostage-taking, levying illegal taxes and making demands for protection money.</PARA>
<PARA>That was all going on when I was there in 1992. Nothing in that sense has changed. The numbers of hard-core Khmer Rouge may have diminished, but they can still mount this sort of guerilla campaign, and they can do it for a long time to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the military activity is concentrated in certain rural areas and that it is infiltrating areas that it was not in before. There is also increasing activity in the Siem Reap province. I remind honourable senators that that is the area where most overseas tourists visit. If they go nowhere else, they try to go to Angkor Wat. That tourist revenue is vitally important for the economic wellbeing of the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government acknowledges that a hard core will inevitably remain and is unlikely to defect or be eradicated other than by military means. The statement also notes that the Khmer Rouge is attempting to counter its losses by using violence and intimidation to obtain forced labour and military reinforcements or porters for the coming dry season. Some incidences of this have been detailed in the statement. The conclusion in the statement notes that the tactics probably indicate that the Khmer Rouge is becoming more desperate. I would dispute that. The Khmer Rouge may well be wanting to get more villagers in to act as bearers and porters, but it also means that it is very effective when it can point to the violence and the terrorism it has already perpetrated. It becomes more effective through fear. We should not write off the Khmer Rouge simply by saying it is becoming more desperate. We should recognise that, if it is more desperate, the measures that it is taking have the potential to make it even more powerful through the control that it will have over the villages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had the up and down situation of the Minister for Foreign Affairs as to whether there is any support across the Thai border. Most of the ASEAN states would acknowledge that support across the Thai border has been going on not just in recent times but historically. A common race of people straddles that border. People have been toing-and-froing across that border for centuries. It also happens to be in the interests of some people to have instability on the other side of the border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not suggesting that it is the Thai government. I presume that the minister is not claiming that it is the Thai government. But I think it is unrealistic to think that it will ever be completely controlled, and therein lies the danger. Trading across the border in timber and gems continues to put resources into the hands of the Khmer Rouge, just as the Vietcong was able to keep being resupplied from the north. Those are the realities that we have to face. As I said, we are prepared to support the measures that have been spelled out in the statement today, but with the provisos and the questions which I have put on the public record which do deserve serious answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to read that the RCAF is to be downsized and rationalised. I believe it is imperative that the Cambodian defence budget should account for much less than the staggering 28 per cent of the total Cambodian budget that it currently occupies. That is one more reason why corruption should have been mentioned. Corruption is one of the root causes for 28 per cent of the Cambodian budget being spent on defence, the troops not being paid and our having to help pay to demobilise the soldiers. That 28 per cent of the budget should not need to be spent on defence. If it was not going into some of the wrong pockets, it would not need to be. If it was not going into some of the wrong pockets, the soldiers would be paid. The Australian taxpayer has been spending enough on making our own servicemen redundant. I wonder why Cambodia cannot organise itself better to demobilise its own soldiers. We know why. It is because of corruption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Defence has grabbed back some of the control over this debate, and I am glad to see that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also agree with the government's emphasis on training and with its assurance that no Australian personnel will be involved in any support or advisory role during any military offensives which might take place in Cambodia. In recent months, there has been a great deal of debate on the benefits or otherwise of Australia providing additional military aid to Cambodia and whether this aid should take the form of training or whether it should include military equipment as well. This debate has intensified as a result of clear evidence being presented of the menacing presence of the Khmer Rouge in the Cambodian countryside and the danger posed by its continued attacks on all aspects of the democratically elected Cambodian government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For many Australians, the problems posed by the Khmer Rouge activities became a significant focal point during the recent kidnapping and subsequent murders of several hostages, including Australians. These events brought home to all of us that the Khmer Rouge is a totally brutal and criminal group&mdash;most of them I imagine are not very sane either&mdash;whose continued presence should no longer be tolerated by the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cambodia is entirely justified in requesting additional defence assistance from a number of nations, including Australia, particularly as this country has already played such a vital role in the implementation of the UN peace plan and also because of our existing involvement in Cambodia, particularly in the form of mine clearance and the installation of an updated and effective military communications system. It is perhaps understandable that, given the way the Cambodian armed forces were pulled together from very disparate forces, certain problems would have been encountered in its attempts to deal with the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to remember that the Royal Cambodian Armed Forces are not the same as the Australian Defence Force. We are very lucky in this country. We probably have one of the most professional defence forces in the world.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the obvious failure of the Cambodian military in effectively dealing with the Khmer Rouge has probably been exacerbated by both the political and economic problems which the emerging Cambodian democracy has had to grapple with. Unfortunately, the Khmer Rouge's continued presence has not been helped by the relatively strong economic base, supported as it is&mdash;and it certainly still is&mdash;by an extremely lucrative trade in timber and gemstones across the country's borders, including the Thai border. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have always believed that if it were possible to cut off its substantial economic power base then the international community would stand a far better chance of finally seeing an end to the Khmer Rouge. Certainly, recent comments by various Thai government representatives represent a very hopeful sign that Thailand has been moving to cut off the economic relationships and the lines of support which have effectively kept the Khmer Rouge in business in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Newman said, nobody in this chamber has ever said that the Thai government was the one doing that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the strength of Thailand's assurances on this issue in recent months, especially since the remarks of Senator Gareth Evans, the Democrats hope that the international community will shortly be witnessing the benefits of Thailand's forceful anti-Khmer Rouge strategy delivering results.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The international community needs to be reminded that long lasting peace in Cambodia can be brought about only with a continued and substantial development and aid commitment from the international donor community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we are asked for a further escalation in funding to support the Australian military aid program in Cambodia. What is not recognised is that we are already spending $25.5 million per year. There is a program of $92 million starting this financial year in civilian aid. There is $3 million under the military aid program. And to that we have today added another $5 million. There is something like $32 million going to Cambodia this year. The question that must be asked is: what is Australia's responsibility to Cambodia? Senator Evans answers that in the first paragraph of his statement today:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our national interest in removing Cambodia as a source of regional instability and tension; our national interest, as a good international citizen, in relieving to the extent possible the enormous humanitarian problems posed by continuing insurgency in Cambodia; and our national interest in facilitating Cambodia's&mdash;and Indochina's&mdash;economic and political reintegration into regional and international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>They are all good and laudable reasons, but they are irrelevant, in one sense, until we assign some priority to Australia's involvement in those matters. We have to recognise that Australia has limited resources and, thanks to this government, we are hugely in debt ourselves and almost in need of an aid program. So we have to set priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This year this government is giving $66.2 million to Indonesia; $50.4 million to Vietnam; $40.3 million to the Philippines; and now this $30-odd million to Cambodia. The great majority of Australians do not agree with those being our priorities. They think that we have a greater relationship with, and an obligation to, the nations in our near region, principally Papua New Guinea, which the foreign minister does not want to recognise exists. The government has consistently run down the long-term funding obligations we have to that country and to the South Pacific and the South West Pacific areas. They are just a black hole when it comes to policy and interest from this government. Of course, we have an interest in doing things for ourselves and in creating some opportunities to get the nearly one million unemployed off the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I deal with Australian policy in respect of Cambodia, a brief history of this state is important. Cambodia is a very unfortunate buffer state between two great countries, Vietnam and Thailand, and they have fought over Cambodia for most of the last millennium. In recent history there was the government of Prince Norodom Sihanouk from 1953 to 1970. From 1970 to 1975 there was the Lon Nol regime. From 1975 to 1979 there was the Khmer Rouge regime, controlled by Pol Pot, which was truly one of the most terrible regimes in history. From 1979 to 1989 there was the invasion by Vietnam of Cambodia. From 1989 to 1992 there was SOC and the successors to SOC after the election, the coalition government of FUNCINPEC and CPP as SOC has become. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence, Australian policy on Cambodia prior to the Paris agreement has been characterised by undue optimism. We have still not reached a hard-headed, pragmatic appreciation of the situation in the country. When the Paris agreement was signed, we made a large contribution to UNTAC, which was the most expensive operation ever that the UN has entered into, costing over $A3 billion. Australia's contribution to that was honourable and very effective in bringing about the outcomes that it did. Since the election in Cambodia, Australian policy has been directed towards a face saving exercise for the wrong appreciations we made at the outset. It is quite true that we do not have any pragmatic policy in this country. We have a policy vacuum in relation to the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition was always very uneasy about these flaws in the policy, and we said so on the opportunities that were provided to us from 1990 onwards. Post-election we have been very concerned about this vacuum in the government's approach to a country in which it has taken a very keen interest. The Khmer Rouge is very important factor; it is probably the most important factor in Cambodian affairs. What we are faced with today is a rather simplistic view that if, somehow or other, we fixed up the royal Cambodian army, we would eliminate the Khmer Rouge. Nothing could be further from the truth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not a defender of the Khmer Rouge at all. I think it is one of the most terrible regimes we have seen on the face of the earth. In four years, when running the country, it killed between one to two million people. Anyone who had any education at all was just taken out and slaughtered. If one had glasses, it was a sign that one was educated. If one had travelled overseas, if one had relatives overseas, one was anti-Cambodian, so one was taken out and slaughtered. We had this insane regime which tried to go back to an early primitive agricultural economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1979, the Vietnamese moved in and took on the Khmer Rouge. The Vietnamese were the victors of the war in Vietnam. They were very skilled and understood completely guerrilla warfare. They were well led and well trained. In 10 years the Vietnamese army had nearly 55,000 soldiers killed. The Khmer Rouge troops killed and wounded in the order of a quarter of a million Vietnamese troops. They could not beat the Khmer Rouge in 10 years. The scale of losses of the Vietnamese army was comparable to the American losses in Vietnam. To say that the Khmer Rouge is an irrelevant force within the context of Cambodian affairs is quite wrong. </PARA>

It is said to be short of some military materiel. I am not sure of that because I think there is quite a bit of materiel around Cambodia. The other great problem that the Cambodian army suffers from is that it is a melding of three traditional enemies. After the election and the formation of the coalition government, those armies came together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no question that, as Senator Newman said, it needs to be restructured, it needs to be disciplined, its training needs to be improved and it needs some materiel. Most important of all of those is the inculcation of discipline and obedience within the troops. While courage, technical skill and skill at arms are fundamental and important assets of an army, the most important asset of an army is obedience, because without obedience it is a rabble. The RCAF is a long way from being a trained obedient force at the present time. But it is no good putting effort into the army when the government in place is as incompetent and inadequate as the Cambodian government is at the present time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In a nutshell, it is weak, indecisive, incompetent and corrupt. Senator Evans by way of interjection says that that is in his paper. That is perfectly true, but he does not draw any conclusions from that. He does not go on and suggest programs which will deal with the fundamental problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Soldiers will not go out and fight for a government that they know is incompetent, inadequate and corrupt. A soldier's calling requires him to lay down his life for his country and no RCAF soldier at the present time thinks that that is a good idea given the present government in Phnom Penh. They are faced with Khmer Rouge troops who really will die for the cause. They believe in what they are doing, however terrible it might have been in the past. They are prepared to fight and die for the cause they believe in. We are just not going to get anywhere until we can inspire the RCAF soldiers by having a solid, honest administration behind them which they know is doing the best for the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has proposed that there be no lethal aid given to the RCAF in this venture. We on this side of the chamber support that entirely. It is very easy to make a simple division between advisers that go there to train and advisers that get involved in combat operations. In practice it does not work out that way. It is a very difficult line to enforce once we get involved in the training of the defence force of another country. We saw this very clearly with Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The big difference between Vietnam and Cambodia was that Vietnam was a worthwhile cause. Without the involvement of Australia, America, Korea and all the other countries in Vietnam the whole stability of the South-East Asian area would not exist today. ASEAN would not exist and Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia would not be the prosperous countries they are. The investment in the Vietnam war by Australia and its allies bought a breathing space to develop the democracies in South-East Asia. The same cannot be said about Cambodia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that I suppose Senator Evans is quite oblivious of is the fact that Australia has been involved in training Cambodian troops before. In the early 1970s in the Phuoc Tuy province some of the Lon Nol soldiers were brought across for training by the Australian forces. We on this side of the house are very opposed to Australians being involved in combat operations in Cambodia and we will maintain that vigilance relentlessly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question I have to ask Senator Evans is: why so much money? We are committing $3 million already under the military aid program. We are going to add another $5 million to that, so that is $8 million. Given that we are only sending advisers, we do not have to buy arms or ammunition, pay for extensive travel costs or anything like that, I would have thought $8 million was a very large sum for a training program. I do not have any figures to be able to attribute costs for personnel, but just off the top of my head I would think that, for every $1 million spent, we could accommodate 30 Australian military advisers in a training role in Cambodia, given that most of what they will be doing will be instructional. So I would think $8 million should buy a very sizeable input into the training of the Cambodian army. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty is that, without good diplomatic backup, what are our soldiers going to do? It is all very well to put very capable instructors into the field, but if they are not supported by superior Cambodian officers who value and reinforce what they are doing, if they are not supported by the Cambodian government, then it all is in vain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a military sense, there are plenty of other things that can be done in Cambodia. The question of demining has been raised by all the speakers so far. The mine problem, anti-personnel mines in particular, in Cambodia is an acute problem. Large areas of the country cannot be used for agriculture because it is estimated there are somewhere between six million and 10 million AP mines in the country. No-one knows where they are. No maps were kept at the time and floods have washed the mines around. The dreadful morbidity and mortality of this is seen in the hospitals and rehabilitation centres around Phnom Penh and the other large towns. A great deal of work has to be done there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A great deal needs to be done with educational programs in Cambodia. One of the consequences of the Pol Pot regime was the elimination of anyone with any education. As a consequence, the administration of the country is weak because not enough people have an adequate education. The whole of the administration needs beefing up. The standard of living in the country has to be raised. If those things are done, the effect of the Khmer Rouge will be limited because it will be marginalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not opposed to what is being proposed today. But we are very concerned that the government does not have a clear idea as to why it is doing it and where it wants to end up. We will be watching to make sure that it does not go into any adventures that will put Australian lives at risk in that very attractive but very poor country which, sadly, is going through one of the very worst pages of its history. </PARA>

The last page of the statement that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) has tabled says:</PARA></TALK.START>

Much of that will come from the hard work of the people of that country and will be assisted by appropriate development assistance to social and economic objectives. </PARA>

He is now a rapporteur to the UN Secretary-General with regard to the situation of human rights in Cambodia. What he observes is a mixed bag. There is some progress with regard to courts, the rule of law, and some health and other outcomes for women and children and indeed for all people. But there are deplorable transgressions of human rights in Cambodia, not least of which is corruption in the government and banditry in the countryside. Those serious problems also happen to involve government officials and members of the Cambodian armed forces&mdash;not just the guerillas in the countryside, as we all acknowledge. We acknowledge that there is a problem with the Khmer Rouge's abuse of the Cambodian people being one of the most ghastly records of abuse of people in any country at any time. As I said, there is also the problem of corruption and banditry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Bourne on the cross-border illegal trade and movement of arms. I have crossed the Mekong River myself in a small boat. I have been to Aranyaprathet. I climbed a large tree that gave me a view across the swamps of the border area. My brother, as a surgeon, was a volunteer Red Cross officer in Khao I Dang and other camps along the border. I visited Cambodia as a student 28 years ago and went to Phnom Penh and Siem Reap to see Angkor Wat. At that time it was a peaceful country and a happy place to visit. But from my experience in looking at the border, and from all that we know, that happiness has been totally squandered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been given only a few minutes to speak in this debate.

There does need to be a disciplined armed force. It does need to be trained. There does need to be an instrument for stability and security for the people of that country. With all of the assistance from Australia and other countries, we must respect the sovereignty of Cambodia and do what we can to reinforce its own integrity and its own stability in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last year I was fortunate enough to be one of the parliamentary delegates to the United Nations General Assembly in New York and was able to meet and talk with Lieutenant General Sanderson, an outstanding Australian who played an incredible role in resolving the political problems in Cambodia in the run-up to the successful election. At that time, it was evident that the holding of elections would not resolve Cambodia's problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the hype, there were many absurd statements and a lot of self-congratulatory comments. That election simply provided an opportunity for Cambodia to move forward; it did not guarantee in any way its success. I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), in his statement, quoted himself from June 1993. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The important thing to appreciate is that the democratic foundations for the country's future have now been strongly laid, and it is essentially now for the Cambodian people and parties themselves to resolve how they want to be governed. It is neither possible nor desirable for the international community to try to micro-manage each step of the way.</PARA>
<PARA>That provides him with something of a problem. There is clearly a need for some `micro-management' in some areas if Cambodia is to overcome the disastrous internal problems created by the Khmer Rouge. The minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Government has never been either ignorant or naively optimistic about the massive scale of the problems that would have to be dealt with by the newly elected Government, not least the problem of containing the Khmer Rouge (KR) after it walked away from the peace process in 1992. But we have taken the view from the outset that the KR insurgency would be containable and ultimately defeatable&mdash;in the same way that the communist insurgencies had been contained and ultimately defeated in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines&mdash;provided there was a government in place with democratic legitimacy, a continued cessation of the kind of direct external support the KR had received in the past, and continued support both for economic reconstruction and national institution-building from the international community.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to deal with this problem because it seems that it is the massive gap in this whole matter. With something like a per capita income of $210 per annum, Cambodia's nine million people are among the poorest and most disadvantaged in the world. As this statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is evident that Cambodia will need substantial long term international assistance in this task. The economy needs major structural development and reform. It lacks adequate infrastructure, power and communications; industry and manufacturing, to the extent they exist, are badly run-down; the country lacks a skilled and trained labour force; public administration and government is terribly weak; health and education services need to be rebuilt; and the judicial and regulatory systems are virtually non-existent. The situation is further complicated because of inadequate administrative structures, corruption, political uncertainty and real concern about security.</PARA>
<PARA>They are the major problems. My concern is: what is being done about the major problems? Until we can establish that this country is capable of providing a better future for its population than the Khmer Rouge is offering at the point of a gun, then the Khmer Rouge will have continual opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is unnerving is that the IMF in a recent review was concerned about the slow rate of disbursement of international donor pledges and noted that this was holding up much needed reform of key sectors, such as agriculture. It is true that Australia has been diligent in disbursing its pledges, but the fact is that, without much greater support, Cambodia will continue to be at risk from the Khmer Rouge, no matter how hopeful our expectations are that insurgencies such as Malaysia would be capable of being diminished. Lieutenant General Sanderson has said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there would be serious concerns about providing pure military assistance to the military unless structural reforms and institutional reforms were put in place first of all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;It is a little difficult to please the opposition. One is asked to produce a detailed statement of explanation of the basis on which we are proceeding, an evaluation of the security situation and an explanation of what we are spending and why. One does that in great detail&mdash;54 paragraphs worth&mdash;and still there are complaints, whinges and grumbles of one kind or another. But that is fair enough because that is what we have had over the entire period we have been trying to wrestle with the Cambodian problem. I guess it would be too much to hope for some graciousness to be at last demonstrated at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essence of the opposition's problems with the statement seem to come down to four themes, emphasised with differing degrees of stress by the various contributors to the debate. One theme is the suggestion that there has been no consistent or coherent approach to the whole Cambodian problem over the years that we have been wrestling with it. A second theme is that the analysis we have offered of the situation as it exists today and what we can do about it is simplistic, trite, banal, inadequate and inappropriate in those ways to deal with the nature of the problem we have. A third criticism, most notably articulated by Senator MacGibbon, was that we are spending too much. A fourth criticism, most evident from Senator Baume, is that we are apparently spending too little. That seems to cover the broad ground. There were some other specific matters raised by Senator Newman which I will try to pick up along the way, but I will address those basic themes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the suggestion of an absence of a consistency or coherence in the government's approach since we started to try to help to resolve this problem, indeed from the mid-1980s onward, I do not think there is foundation for that. We have always acknowledged the scale and the size of the Khmer Rouge problem. Indeed, anyone witnessing the horrors of the killing fields could hardly fail to appreciate the devastating impact that experience has had on the Cambodian people and the need to try as an international community to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have taken the view from the outset that the Khmer Rouge problem could be contained and ultimately defeated, as I have said in the statement, in exactly the same way that similar communist insurgencies had been contained and ultimately defeated in Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, provided a number of conditions were satisfied: first, that there was a government in place with democratic legitimacy; secondly, that there was a cessation of the external support that had fuelled the continuation of conflict for so long and, in particular, fuelled the capacity of the Khmer Rouge to wage it; and, thirdly, that there had to be some major support for economic reconstruction, national institution building and similar things coming from the international community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was really what the peace process was all about&mdash;trying to put in place those three elements. Up until 1989 people struggled with a political solution that would involve a process of agreement between the four warring factions to form some kind of interim government which could create the conditions for, ultimately, democratic elections. That did not prove possible for a whole variety of reasons, including the suspicion, distrust and indeed hatred that they all felt for each other. It was for that reason that Australia did come up with the proposal, subsequently implemented, not to try to create a quadripartite government with sovereign executive authority; rather it would get the UN to play that role and create the conditions which would lead to a democratically elected government. That is indeed what happened, albeit not in quite the way we had all hoped: the Khmer Rouge opted out of the process very early on. Nonetheless, the process did produce a democratically elected government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing we had to achieve was the cessation of the proxy war; the support that the major external powers, including China in particular and other countries, were giving to the Khmer Rouge; the support that Vietnam and Russia, then the Soviet Union, standing behind it were giving to Hun Sen's government in Phnom Penh; and the support of other major players, including the United States and some of the ASEAN states, who were in the picture as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the case that the whole peace plan was constructed on the basis of what was necessary to create the conditions for that withdrawal of international military support for the warring parties to occur. The great single achievement&mdash;whatever else might have been less than a complete achievement&mdash;of the UN peace plan was to get those external patrons and players out of the game, and that situation has continued to the present day. Those on the other side who do not acknowledge the significance of that achievement are being a little ungracious. That really was what we were all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing we had to achieve was the creation of conditions for major international support to flow. That was not going to happen while there was in place a government lacking any degree of democratic legitimacy. We needed the kind of process we had been through to produce that situation. We now have that international support flowing under the chairmanship of Japan through the ICORC process, the International Conference on the Reconstruction of Cambodia. It is to be hoped that, over time, that will produce the strengthening of the economic and governmental institutions of the country that are so obviously necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the outset&mdash;Senator Baume clearly acknowledged this&mdash;we have taken the position that the election process itself, in satisfying all of these three conditions that I just mentioned, would not necessarily result in the achievement of the kind of stable, peaceful and democratic society that we wanted. An enormous amount was always going to depend on the capacity of the Cambodian people to work in a united, effective and committed way to build their own country, something they could not do, certainly without international assistance but, equally, something that the international community could not impose or guarantee without their assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That has been the consistent theme of our approach to all this right from the outset. As I say in the statement, all this was our view at the outset and it remains our view today. If in fairness we stand back and look at this process, with all the agonising twists and turns it has taken, we will see that those basic themes have been running through it and they persist today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We come to the second problem: the alleged triteness, banality or simplicity of the response allegedly contained in the government's statement today, which is that this continuing problem of Khmer Rouge insurgency can somehow be quickly fixed by the kind of military support injection that we are here proposing. Let me say this: we make it very clear in the statement that, while the military support in getting a competent, disciplined and effective army together is a necessary condition for creating a better security environment than exists at the moment, it is not a sufficient condition. Of course it will have to be accompanied by a major effort on the part of the Cambodian government to get its act together in all the ways that it has not been doing so successfully in the last few months of this year. That point is made very explicitly in paragraph 36 of the statement. Everything we are doing demonstrates our seriousness of purpose in making that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not just giving the additional military assistance that is involved in this statement; it is giving $92 million worth of civil aid over the course of four years, most of which is designed to be directly helpful to infrastructure development, the delivery of social programs and the sorts of things that are necessary, quite apart from delivering immediate benefits to the Cambodian people, to assist the credibility of the Cambodian government. We are recognising the necessity for much more financial support to be given for that purpose than purely on the military side. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the notion that&mdash;to the extent that this came through in some of the contributions&mdash;this kind of military assistance is not by itself going to be of any particular utility, either because of the scale of the problem with which we are dealing or because of the notion that we really ought to be spending the money on something else, let me say that, when it comes to spending money on something else, of course we need to spend a lot of money as an international community on supporting the non-military side of the effectiveness equation, but it is not a matter of `either . . . or'; it is a matter of `both . . . and'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Effective development cannot proceed without a sense of security. The two things need to go hand in hand. It does seem to be the case that, without the injection of some support from the international community, we are not going to break the back of the initial capital expenditure on barracks and training facilities to get over the lack of training and discipline that exists at the moment.

All I can say is that the numbers we have given, both now and going back over the last two or three years, represent all the best evidence available to us.

All I am saying in that respect is: please understand that the nature of problem is not such that this is unmanageable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes it is containable. We believe it is ultimately defeatable, but a lot depends on progress being made simultaneously on all these fronts&mdash;getting the military's act together and getting the government's act together. So long as the government does not have its act together and so long as there is an undisciplined military perpetrating a number of the things that are causing distress in the countryside, it will not be creating an environment in which there will be that confidence on the part of the people or that morale on the part of military itself which will produce the results we all want. All of these things have to work together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We happen to believe that the signs were there. In the first six to nine months of the existence of the new government, those conditions were being met, and gradually the pieces were falling into place. I had been accused of waxing and waning in my assessments of the situation. It is the case that, when I was in Cambodia in April this year, I came away feeling very up-beat and very optimistic indeed about the situation that I found. The landscape was littered with problems, many of them&mdash;in the human rights area, in particular&mdash;needing a huge amount of additional attention, but they did seem to be manageable. What happened, as we all    now know, is that in May-June we had the debacle of the military adventure&mdash;misconceived, ill-executed&mdash;producing disastrous results in Pailin and Anlong Veng. As a result, morale tended to collapse and with it the effectiveness of the government. It has been a long, slow haul to try to recover ground, but I believe it is recoverable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the subject of spending too much, we had Senator MacGibbon querying the total of something like $30 million that will, indeed, be spent in calendar year 1995, with a combination of the proportion of the $92 million aid program and the military expenditure. I ask Senator MacGibbon to please compare that with the nearly $10 billion we are spending on the defence budget this year and the $1.4 billion we are spending on the aid budget. Without my going into any more comparative analysis, I ask Senator MacGibbon to please try to consider that it might just be arguable that this is money worth spending if, indeed, it is going to have a degree of effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator MacGibbon queried what the money was going to be spent on.

English language training is part of it, as is mine clearance. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS> The proportion of the $92 million will be spent not on training but on child health care, education, human rights, rehabilitation of infrastructure, agriculture and, again, demining. </PARA>

Quite apart from our own budgetary and personnel contribution, there are a number of other countries involved in the mine clearance project. Paragraph 38 of the statement indicates that it is not only Australia which is involved but Belgium, Canada, France, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Norway and the United States. Indeed, the US has quite a number of personnel engaged in this project, with quite a significant capital commitment. </PARA>

The computer database has been established. The training programs are in place. A lot of the problem is that a number of the areas where the mines need to be cleared are insufficiently secure at the moment to enable the process to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I simply do not accept that there is any rational justification for the argument that too much money is being spent. As to Senator Baume's argument that too little is being spent, that is just making the point that the international community needs to make a major, continued commitment, particularly on institution building, infrastructure support, social policy support, human rights, justice, and law enforcement support&mdash;all of which are very much part of the program at the moment. I repeat, finally: if we were just throwing money at it to try to resolve the military side of the problem without simultaneously making a major effort on all those other dimensions of it, then I think it would be challengeable. But I think we can hold our heads up in terms of the contribution that we are making there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to one or two other points that Senator Newman raised, she wanted to know where Australian personnel were going to be located and what the security regime applicable to them would be.

That is the person who will be associated with the construction of the facility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But to finish what I was saying about expenditure of the money, $3 million of the $8 million that Senator MacGibbon referred to will go on the existing defence cooperation programs that I have already mentioned. Some $2 million of that is out of the aid program and will go directly to support the demobilisation activity. The remaining $3 million will be spent as a one-off package which will involve further work, which is spelt out in the statement, designing an overall training program, training junior officers in Australia&mdash;that is a large part of the financial commitment that is involved there&mdash;and providing design assistance and the construction funds for the RCAF to construct an additional training facility. I think Senator Newman's scepticism about whether the money can be accounted for with only a limited number of personnel being involved is accounted for by that response I have just given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the security of the ADF personnel, limited though their numbers might be, we have given a detailed assessment in paragraph 44 of the statement about the overall security environment both now and as we assess it as being likely to be in the aftermath of this announcement. Beyond that, I can simply say this: obviously the security situation both of the ADF personnel and the wider Australian community in Cambodia is of prime importance. It has been very closely examined in the context of making this decision and obviously one of the most difficult single issues has been to weigh and balance the worth of what we are doing against the possible increase in the risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All that one can really say is that the security situation does vary from place to place, from time to time. The protection of ADF personnel is the responsibility, and will remain the responsibility, of the RCAF. Acknowledging the problems that are associated with relying on the RCAF in its present condition, we have to make the judgment that it may be necessary to further review the security situation from time to time. Security conditions and individual areas will be taken into account in the deployment of ADF personnel and they will not be deployed to areas where there is an assessed high risk of attack from the Khmer Rouge. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The minister is no doubt aware that today's balance of payments figure for October came in at $1.65 billion seasonally adjusted, or $1.85 billion on the trend estimate, and that the current account deficit for the first four months of this financial year is just under $9 billion, or 45 per cent worse than this time last year. If the balance of payments continues along this path for the remainder of this financial year Australia will have a record current account debt of $27 billion, 50 per cent higher than the budget forecast. In those circumstances what does the government intend to do with this balance of payments crisis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The note of deathly drama in Senator Hill's voice is a little bit misplaced, at least as far as the October figures&mdash;the monthly figures&mdash;announced today are concerned because they are significantly below market expectations. They are also significantly below the $1.8 billion of the last month, significantly below the $2.2 billion of the previous month and significantly below the $1.8 billion in July. So if the opposition is looking to derive some nourishment, excitement, gloom, funereal maudlin anxiety from this month's figures, it cannot do so because bearing in mind all the caveats and all the qualifications one always advances about particular month's figures, it is the case that there was a substantial decrease in the merchandise trade deficit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports rose by five per cent with the most significant rises, again as is often the case, in the elaborately transformed area, and imports rose by comparison only two per cent. So if one is looking for an analysis of the present situation there is nothing but joy. But one cannot take one month's figures by themselves; we never have done that and we will not do so in the future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just draw attention to the absurdity of the opening bars of this little cadenza we had from Senator Hill today. Of course, the figures for the last quarter, the September quarter, are not so good&mdash;it blew out higher than we had hoped for. The environment has been one characterised in particular by a pretty substantial growth in imports and, in particular, capital imports. But, of course, as we have constantly said, that volume of capital goods imports increase is very closely associated with the recovery, and some deterioration in the current account deficit simply had to be expected at this stage of the cycle, given the strength of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt about the underlying strength of the economy. Investment, about which the opposition used to be asking questions every second day of the week for the first half of this year, is now growing strongly. When is the last time the opposition asked a question about the investment figures? No, the opposition does not want to know about investment figures because the news there is good and the opposition is not in the business of acknowledging that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Underlying plant and equipment investment rose 15.6 per cent over the year to June. This, of course, is an increase in the imports of capital equipment. Those imports will increase Australia's productive capacity for the future. We are importing strength for the future. This is not to be seen as in any way a weakness. It is also the case that manufactured exports continued to respond well to the improved economic environment.</PARA>

So that is the environment that we are confronting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is to be any further deterioration in the current account deficit it will be moderated to some significant extent by the strength not only of the overall recovery, generating overall strength there, but also of Australia's exports and the increased competitiveness of the Australian economy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. All we ask for is a touch of realism. To hear the minister talk about nothing but joy in this figure I guess is reminiscent of `a lovely set of figures'. I put this month's figure in the context of the last four months. The previous three months were the worst on record. We keep being told the figures will improve as the recovery continues. They are not improving; they are getting worse. Is this not exactly the same pattern as we saw from the Labor government in the late 1980s and early 1990s, which led to the worst recession in 60 years and one million Australians out of work? When are we going to see some figures that indicate something different?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know this is something about which Senator West has a particular interest and that it has been the subject of some debate in recent times. I am happy in opening to assure the Senate that this government's commitment to effective consultations with interested parties and individuals in the formation of trade policy continues. We do regard that as an essential element of the policy formulation process in a democratic society. So the government values the constructive contribution that Australia's business and community leaders have brought to the open debate on these important national issues. I and my colleagues hope that they will continue to contribute in the way that they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Uruguay Round negotiations, for example, conducted by several of my predecessors and, ultimately, by Senator Cook, the Australian government's Trade Negotiations Advisory Group, chaired by Geoff Allen, was closely involved in the formulation of Australia's negotiating strategies and in conveying outcomes to the business community. This high level of close business government collaboration has been publicly recognised by Mr Allen, who said at the time:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there has been unprecedented co-operation between government and the business sectors. It has represented a model for close business-government collaboration in international affairs.</PARA>
<PARA>During that period 351 industry associations and companies were consulted and provided assistance to the government over the course of the Uruguay Round negotiations. In the current climate the government has a number of consultative forums and, most importantly, the Trade Policy Advisory Council. We also have, for example, the non-government organisations consultative forum on international environmental issues. These and other bodies provide regular input to the policy process and, of course, we have a continuing process of ad hoc consultation with interested individuals and community groups. But let me assure the Senate that the government and I take this process of consultation very seriously and we will be consulting closely with relevant parties as we define the policies which will cement Australia's future well into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the process is not perfect. We can do better; there is no question about that. As it is a dynamic and energetic process, we are continually working to finetune the discourse and strengthen our consultative framework. From time to time there is criticism levelled at the consultative process. Where that criticism is justified and the process is found wanting, we will revise the framework so that it more adequately reflects the full interests of Australia in various trade negotiations. I want to say here clearly on the record that I personally value the constructive role that TPAC and each member of it plays in the government's policy formulation process and I look forward to continuing to work with them in this process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government's responsibility is to protect and advance the overall national interest. This means that we will not always agree with the positions presented to us in the consultative process by any particular group. We certainly could not agree with them all because they do not agree with each other. But we do listen to what they have to say and often we learn from them. The key point I want to reiterate is that we value the input from business and other parts of the Australian community and we intend to continue the consultative process.</PARA>

What I said yesterday stands on the record; that is, that the preferred position for both operational and safety reasons is to reduce to the maximum extent simultaneous operations at the airport.

The point is that the CAA, the Federal Airports Corporation and the airline industry say that it is safe, but they have to follow government policy directions with no option to do otherwise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not the case that the Timor Gap treaty is the only legal agreement anywhere in the world that effectively recognises Indonesia's right to rule in East Timor. There are some 24 countries which have signed treaties with Indonesia which contain clauses defining Indonesia as that territory which is deemed by the laws of Indonesia to be subject to Indonesian sovereignty. A treaty which contains such a provision, if concluded after 1976, can of course be regarded as evidence that, for all effective purposes, the relevant state party recognises East Timor. The following 24 states have signed such treaties: Austria, Brunei, Dar es Salaam, Bulgaria, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition&mdash;and this is in answer to those who say that Australia is the only country in the world that has recognised Indonesian de jure sovereignty over East Timor&mdash;it is the case that several countries have made public statements explicitly recognising Indonesian sovereignty. Those countries include India, Papua New Guinea and the United States of America&mdash;although the US has said that it recognises incorporation of East Timor into Indonesia, without recognising that a valid act of self-determination has taken place.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, a number of states have also indicated that they have recognised the incorporation of East Timor at some stage since 1976 and are doing this by way of explanation of their vote at the UN General Assembly; Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Bangladesh, Canada, Sweden, Papua New Guinea, India, Oman and Jordan are in that category. So when we add all of those up and take out the double counting, there are, I think, 31 countries in total that can be regarded as having expressly or impliedly recognised that degree of sovereignty. That is as to the first point.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the basis of the government's decision to negotiate the treaty, we made the judgment&mdash;or an earlier government than us made the judgment&mdash;back in 1979 that the situation in East Timor was, for all practical purposes, likely to be irreversible and, under those circumstances, it did make sense to try to negotiate some outcome to the contested border between Australia and that part of Indonesia because, until that border issue was resolved, among other things, there was an inability to address the question of exploration and production in what was potentially a very major oil province. Yes, there was a resource motivation for this; it has never been suggested otherwise. But if we are thinking in terms of assisting the East Timorese people, they had a much better chance of getting the benefits from that resource as a result of it being developed than of it, of course, lying idle through some protracted political squabble that was unlikely ever to be finally resolved in their favour. That was the judgment that was made in 1979. It was repeated by us in 1985, and was the basis for the signing of the treaty in 1991.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The honourable senator asks about self-determination. I am, of course, conscious of the argument that the East Timorese have not had sufficient opportunity to exercise the right of self-determination. I do not want to comment specifically on that question because it is one of the matters in issue in the court case. But I have said on many occasions on the public record, most recently on 14 November and in a speech on 25 November, that I believe that the right of self-determination can be exercised consistently with Indonesia's sovereignty. Indeed, there is a big case for self-determination being more effectively recognised through better protection and recognition of human rights.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program is part of a broad-ranging package of measures in response to the recommendations of the Industry Commission and the horticultural task force report.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program will be developed in direct consultation with citrus growers, processors, fruit juice manufacturers and the Australian Horticultural Corporation.

On 7 November, in referring to files relating to the closure of the North Perth Migrant Resource Centre, he said, `the offices of the department were broken into and the files on this matter were stolen. So the information is probably already public.' Why did he say that when the police did not find any sign of breaking and entering? Was the file in fact removed by an officer of the department at the minister's request? As the information pertaining to his decision is still not public, will he now tell the Senate the source of his advice and table such advice as to whether the information came from the department or from a friend of his wife, a Monica Romeo, who, until recently, worked at the centre and who upon leaving, after receiving a warning about her poor work performance, threatened that if she had to leave, she would take the centre out with her?</PARA></TALK.START>

In the first half of 1994 a review was done about where the North Perth centre should be and that review recommended that we give consideration to repositioning it in the area to which I have decided to send it. That review built on, I think, the demographics of the area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the 1986 census and the 1991 census there have been twice the number of non-English speaking people going to the outer north area as to the inner north.

In terms of where need was not satisfied, we have 13 GIAs in the city or inner north area as opposed to the outer north. There is definitely a need out there. I can say to the opposition that that is where the need was, that is why the decision was taken and that is why the North Perth MRC is going from a Labor electorate to an area which probably is not a Labor electorate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The stance we adopt at the petroleum industry consultative forum will be one we put to the petroleum industry first, I should say, rather than ventilate here. To the first part of the question, the Trade Practices Commission has taken an action but that action has not been heard, nor has it been determined. It is inappropriate to draw a conclusion as to what the outcome of that action might be. Nonetheless, the move by the Trade Practices Commission to take an action against major oil companies is significant and should be noted. But one ought not assume guilt until the process has been finalised and a decision made one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The action that the Trade Practices Commission has taken is specific to behaviour in Melbourne and Sydney between December 1988 and June 1992. It refers to discrete incidents that it alleges in its action. It therefore does not indicate that there is necessarily widespread collusion in the petroleum industry, given that it refers to particular incidents. Since it is specific to Sydney and Melbourne, nor does it go to the question that Senator Spindler has raised of the difference between country and city suppliers of petroleum because the action relates to two capital cities. It ought to be said in those quite qualified terms because of the nature of the legal action on foot and no outcome having been decided.</PARA>

We noted the Industry Commission's suggestion that the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act be repealed. That act, of course, provides a set of minimum terms and conditions for franchisees who are contracting to the major oil companies. Notwithstanding all of that, the government is not prepared, and we have indicated this, to repeal the legislation unless there is a mutually acceptable safety net provision agreed within the oil code, and that is something that ought to be developed.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 November Senator Herron asked me a question on pathology services. I now have an answer for the honourable senator. Over recent years, the government has embarked upon a program of initiatives to restructure the pathology industry and to strengthen arrangements relating to the funding of pathology services under Medicare. In particular, in the 1991-92 budget, a series of major reforms was announced to achieve a more cost effective and efficient Australian pathology industry. These restructuring arrangements were undertaken in cooperation with the pathology industry and profession. Prior to the restructuring, pathology expenditure under Medicare had been growing at an annual rate of 13.7 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills to which Senator Herron refers and the measures they contain are only part of the continuing series of initiatives the government is taking to ensure Australians have access to appropriate and quality pathology services which are affordable to both individuals and the nation. More recent measures include strengthening the powers of the Health Insurance Commission for addressing inappropriate servicing practices under Medicare. The government is aware of the recent growth in pathology outlays to which Senator Herron has referred. In 1993-94, pathology outlays grew by 10.9 per cent after two years of very low growth rates following the restructuring package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Data for the first four months of 1994-95 indicates that the growth is continuing at a rate of 10.6 per cent. By contrast, in 1991-92 pathology outlays fell by 0.3 per cent and in 1992-93 the growth rate was 0.7 per cent. In the absence of restructuring, the long-term trend of 10 per cent growth would have applied throughout and expenditure would now be considerably higher. The situation for pathology is similar to that for the pharmaceutical benefits scheme and the introduction of co-payments for pensioners. That measure led to a reduction in outlays of some 15 per cent. After the initial impact, annual growth of five to six per cent applied. However, the fact that PBS prescription volumes are growing again does not negate the impact of the co-payment. The government recognises the need for further reform of pathology. It is working with the pathology industry and profession to identify the causes of the growth and to examine strategies to contain the growth in pathology utilisation and outlays.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins), to a question without notice asked by Senator Parer this day, relating to the east-west runway at Mascot airport.</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to the response given by Senator Collins, the fact is that the excessive and intolerable noise north of Sydney airport is the result of a deliberate government policy that has nothing to do with safety&mdash;absolutely nothing to do with it at all. I see the minister is leaving the chamber. His departure from this debate indicates the extent to which he is not prepared to listen to the truth. What he has been saying is total nonsense and a deliberate misleading of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a saga of incompetence based on the government's pig-headed determination to stick to a promise which happens to benefit Messrs Brereton and Punch, two right-wing members of the Labor Party, at the expense of Mr Baldwin and Mrs McHugh, two left-wing members whose electorates are in the new flight path. It was a determination by Mr Brereton to deliver on this promise before it properly could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there is intolerable noise north of the Kingsford Smith airport only because the deliberate policy not to use the east-west runway&mdash;not for safety reasons but for political reasons&mdash;was made before there was any need to deliver on the promise not to use it. The promise not to use the east-west runway, made in 1989, was made on the basis that it would not be used once the additional north-south runway, the parallel runway, came into operation. It has not yet fully come into operation. It was opened with a grand gesture by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), but it is not in full operation because it has no control tower and no adequate radar. The control tower will not be installed until next month and the radar not until the end of next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is happening is a total disgrace. In order to keep Kingsford Smith airport operating at almost a reasonable level&mdash;in fact, it is not a reasonable level; there have been significant cuts to and enormous delays in the number of landings and so on, causing incredible disruption to airline schedules&mdash;the parallel runway cannot properly be used and, as a result, corners are having to be cut on flight paths out of the existing north-south runway. All this has occurred because of a political decision not to use the east-west runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because fast aircraft, like 747s, have to wait until slower aircraft get out of the way, the air traffic controllers&mdash;quite sensibly, in the sense of keeping that airport open&mdash;are getting the slow aircraft to deviate from the normal flight path much sooner and at a much lower height than the previously normal, proper pattern so that the faster aircraft can get off. Another thing that is happening is that, instead of going to the end of the runway, which is the proper procedure, so that the aircraft are higher when they are over populated areas&mdash;that is the norm in all European airports&mdash;the aircraft are taking off from crossways. The first crossway an aircraft gets to on the runway it takes off from. So aircraft are going over those suburbs to the north of the airport at a much lower height than would be the case if they took the extra time to go to the end of the runway. This is all in the name of speeding up proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has imposed a ludicrous constraint on take-offs from this airport by basically prohibiting the use of the east-west runway as a political stunt. It is a political stunt for the benefit of two right wingers at the expense of the electorates of two left wingers, increasing the prospect of an independent knocking off those two left wingers. That would be a terrible thing for the Labor Party, I am certain. Fancy having to get rid of two left wingers! The situation of excessive noise and ludicrous damage to people's psyches and to property values, apart from anything else, is absurd. As for fixing up this problem by opening the airport out at Badgerys Creek, that cannot possibly happen for ages and ages and will cost billions of dollars. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Of course, we always thought we would get the third runway, but what we actually have is another second runway because the government has closed the east-west runway, which was previously open. There are all sorts of claims about safety matters here and it begs the question: if it suddenly is not safe to use the east-west runway, what was the situation for the last 40 years when we were all using the east-west runway as well as the north-south runway?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Hill) this day, relating to the balance of payments.</PARA>
<PARA>In his response to Senator Hill today, Senator Gareth Evans, in his normal bumbling, un-understanding of economics way, was completely misleading. The facts are that today we have seen a disastrous balance of payments figure for October. That comes on top of a string of disastrous balance of payments figures which are plunging this nation into potentially the largest balance of payments deficit that we have ever faced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's own budget estimate for the balance of payments deficit this financial year, 1994-95, is $18 billion, which is about four per cent of GDP. Last year, the figure, the actual out-turn, was $16 billion, which was 3.75 per cent of GDP. So even on the government's own figures, it expects a blow-out in the balance of payments figure for 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the revised September quarter balance of payments figures revealed a record September quarter deficit of $6.1 billion. That was higher in dollar terms than the previous record, which was in September 1989. It was that level of deficit that prompted the then Treasurer and now Prime Minister, Mr Keating, to engineer what he called the recession we had to have, with all the disastrous consequences that that has had for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the October monthly figures came out. They reveal a seasonally adjusted deficit figure of $1.65 billion, or $1.85 billion on the trend estimates. So for the first four months of this financial year, the current account deficit is almost $9 billion. That is almost half as large again as the figure for the comparable period last year, which was itself dangerously and unsustainably high. If the level of the first four months of this financial year remains steady for the entire year, the year as a whole result will be a deficit of $27 billion, which is $9 billion, or 50 per cent, higher than the government's budget estimate, which was unacceptably high anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A comparison of the first four months of this financial year with the first four months of the last financial year shows some equally disconcerting figures. The merchandise trade deficit has deteriorated by $2.6 billion, which is a 366 per cent deterioration over last year. The net income deficit, which is mainly interest on foreign debt, has deteriorated by $274 million, despite falling interest rates. Of course, that deficit will rise significantly in coming months as higher interest rates begin to take effect on repayments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first four months of this year, exports were only about the same as they were for the first four months of last year. On the other hand, imports were up by a sizeable 11 per cent, an increase of $2.6 billion over that period. The appalling state of Australia's external account will be the Achilles heel that once again forces the Australian government to rapidly and savagely tighten monetary policy in a desperate attempt to slow economic activity and relieve pressure on the balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing is the emergence of precisely the same problem that we had in the late 1980s which saw Australia crash into the most prolonged recession since the 1930s. The reason for that is simple: the government lacks the political will to take the necessary actions in the areas of fiscal policy and industrial relations policy as a result of its subservience to the trade union movement and pressure groups throughout the community which are preventing this government having the ability or the intestinal fortitude to pursue the policies that are necessary to set this nation back on the road of sustainable economic growth. </PARA>

<PARA>I thank the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) for his undertaking to listen to all players in the industry. He will need to because at the moment the pronouncements by the Industry Commission and the recommendation to deregulate the industry totally are discredited. While the matters are yet to go through the court, the TPC's strong evidence appears to come from the electronic mail system of the major oil companies, with E-mail messages detailing discussions between the three companies covering the Sydney and Melbourne markets between 1988 and 1992 leading to alleged price fixing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for the minister to say, `It only refers to those years and it only refers to Sydney and Melbourne markets.' However, the clear fact is that, if prices in the cities are fixed, people in the country must be affected. The oil companies must derive their profits from somewhere. It is quite clear that prices in the bunched city markets have been kept artificially low and that prices in the country have been 15 to 20 per cent higher. What is needed, according to the Industry Commission, is extensive deregulation of the industry to unleash the forces of the market, with all the disastrous consequences this would have for Australians in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government, after receiving the report, promised extensive consultations through the petroleum industry consultative forum. Once again, I am glad that the minister has given that undertaking. The development of a safety net proposal was to be a key agenda item at the first meeting of the forum on the proposal to be held this Friday. Yet early indications from the government are that the safety net looks like being a very thin affair, with most industry participants being thrown to the dogs by the big oil companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we had the grenade thrown by the Trade Practices Commission. The issue now is not what is a minimal safety net while the regulatory restraints are taken off the oil majors. Instead, the issue must be what active policies government must adopt to restructure the petroleum industry to make it competitive for consumers both in the city and in the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Democrats will be watching the outcome of the forum meeting very closely. We call on the government to publicly reject the Industry Commission conclusions in respect of the industry being competitive. Very clearly, it is not. Petrol prices are important, especially when country people are paying far higher prices than city people for reasons even the Industry Commission cannot explain. We need a competitive petroleum industry, but to achieve that there will need to be recognition that we do not have such an industry now and that only a government backed restructuring plan will achieve one. If the government cannot produce such an outcome through its processes, I foreshadow that the Democrats in this parliament might just have to do it for it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) this day, to a question without notice asked by Senator Herron on 17 November 1994, relating to pathology services in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>The reason for asking that question on 17 November was to point out the fact that there has been a dramatic increase in pathology services in Australia over the last 12 months. The answer that Senator Crowley gave today was based on the table that I gave her, tabled in the Senate and incorporated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> on 17 November. There has been a 10.9 per cent increase in benefits paid for pathology over the last 12 months, rising from $633 million to $702 million&mdash;a major amount of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The basis for asking the question was to point out the tremendous dislocation that has been brought about by the measures that the government produced over two years ago. At that time I spoke in the Senate on this matter and told the government that the dislocation it was bringing about in the restriction of collection centres would not work. There was a delay for a couple of years, and now the number of services and the expenditure not only on pathology but on radiology and pharmaceutical benefits as well have increased dramatically. This was brought out during a Senate estimates committee hearing held on the same night that that question was asked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer we got today is that the government is taking further steps. I wish it would stop taking further steps. Every time it takes further steps it means further dislocation, further restriction on patients and a further imposition of bureaucracy and government. I am told that we have 6,000 bureaucrats in Canberra who administer health care in all its parameters&mdash;6,000! Every time further steps are taken we get more regulation, more control and a slight delay for a period. It is a bit like trying to stop the waves. We are trying to stop the ageing of the population. We are trying to stop the future development of technology, the demand on technology and the demands made on a system that is fundamentally bankrupt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the time the government answer is to keep the cake the same size and cut the slices thinner. That is what the government is trying to do. It will not work. How long do we have to go on pointing out to the government that it has to make the cake a bit bigger? That is what Dr John Quiggin, the senior research officer of economics at the Australian National University, said two days ago. It has to be realised that we cannot stop these inexorable forces that are going on in society and at the same time keep a cap on expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proudly boasts that, in relation to a proportion of gross domestic product, for 13 years it has kept the same cap on expenditure on health care. But all that has occurred is that the expenditure has shifted from state government to federal government and the imposition has been put on the private citizen. The amount of money that is brought in from the private sector has increased dramatically. The amount of money that has come from the Medicare levy has been static because of the number of people paying it. Less than one-third of the population of Australia pays any Medicare levy. It is basically coming out of taxation, and that is the government contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is an interesting statistic that the budget deficit of $16,000 million to $17,000 million equals the federal government overall expenditure on health care. It will increase, and nothing that the government will do will do anything other than produce further dislocation for the people who are affected by these regulations, and that is the patients. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was interested to hear Senator Faulkner's response to Senator Chamarette about turbidity and the effect this has on the seagrass in the Hinchinbrook Channel. One really has to think more deeply about some of that. First of all, I am told that the turbidity in the Hinchinbrook Channel has been there permanently for as long as people can remember. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last Saturday morning, when I was speaking from a truck on a park on the side of the Hinchinbrook Channel, another speaker invited the 1000-strong audience to look out at the channel. He quite rightly pointed out that at times with the winds blowing in various directions&mdash;and it was quite a strong wind that day&mdash;one can see that the whole Hinchinbrook Channel area is very muddy looking. That is not a result of anything except the conditions. The locals who have lived there all of their lives know that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, it is said that the knocking down of the mangroves will get rid of the seagrass beds in the Hinchinbrook Channel. But six, or seven, or eight, or nine or 10 years ago, under the former Queensland government, approval was given to start on that site. Huge areas of mangroves were removed. Lo and behold, there are still huge seagrass beds in the channel today&mdash;notwithstanding the fact that acres of those mangroves were removed up to 10 years ago. So one must wonder about the veracity of the claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, my office in Townsville has been contacted by a number of fishermen who have fished that area for many decades. They know the area. They are not scientists, but  they are people who understand what happens to the water. A man told me&mdash;and this person has no reason to tell me untruths&mdash;that when the south-east trades come in any regular form, and they have not happened for three or four years, the seagrass beds just go out of the channel. When the season moves on, they come back. So it is a matter of nature and it has been doing that for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people who tell me these things go on to say that nobody has contacted them for their opinion.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, I am told&mdash;and I have not checked this myself, but I mention it for what it is worth&mdash;that there were photographs of that area taken during World War II by air force and naval reconnaissance aircraft which quite clearly show that mangroves were not there in those days. The mangroves come and go. I fish mangrove creeks in Ayr where I live, a couple of hundred kilometres south of the Hinchinbrook area. I know the mangroves. They are very sturdy plants. They will regenerate and regrow. Nothing will stop them if they want to grow in a particular area. So I think there is a lot of stupidity about some of the claims being made. There is a lot of hype and the matter obviously requires much further investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I obviously cannot get an answer from Senator Faulkner to the question I put to him. I asked him to assure the Senate that he would not yet again override a sovereign government which has approved projects for seven or eight particular resorts in North and Far North Queensland. They have approvals.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner was not prepared to give that assurance. It obviously means that he is again going to ride roughshod over the sovereign government, ignore the jobs and the tourism potential and dollars that those projects will bring, and simply again exercise his powers very arbitrarily. I invited him yesterday to come and have a look at Port Hinchinbrook with me. He has caused all that trouble, cost all those jobs and made all that division in that community&mdash;without having set foot in the area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not delay the Senate unduly, given our need to get on to other matters. Today I wanted to raise, and comment on, a comment made by Senator Bolkus, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, at the government's launching of its citizenship campaign on 9 November this year. In reality, that launch was simply a glittering public relations exercise for the government at the taxpayers' expense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his speech at the launch, Senator Bolkus described Australia as `an independent nation in all but law'. What an extraordinary statement, even for this minister. Has Senator Bolkus not heard of the Australian constitution&mdash;the document from which this government and this nation derive their legal standing? Or is he saying&mdash;indeed, I am sure he did not mean to&mdash;that his government has no legal standing?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian constitution gains its standing from two factors. First, it is a document which comes from the people of Australia. It was voted on and accepted by state referenda in the late 1890s, and in 1900 in the case of Western Australia. It is also an act of the British parliament&mdash;the Commonwealth Constitution of Australia Act 1900&mdash;which granted legal independence to the six colonies in Australia to become a new independent federation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the constitution, specific power is given to the Australian people to make all future changes to the constitution&mdash;the legal framework of our nationhood&mdash;via section 128 of the referendum provision which gives Australian people control of their constitution. There was further Australian and complementary British acts which sought to and did further entrench and clarify beyond any doubt whatsoever the concept of legal independence in Australia. These were the Statute of Westminster in 1931 and, even more significant and much more recent, the Australia Act of 1986. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know whether Senator Bolkus was merely ignorant of these important, basic constitutional facts or whether he just did not understand them. For Senator Bolkus to tell a group of new Australian citizens in particular&mdash;but the Australian community as a whole&mdash;that this country is not independent at law is not only wrong, it is also mischievous. He may have been sounding a warning, although I doubt it, against his own Labor government's moves to undermine our national independence&mdash;that great independence that we have treasured for so many years&mdash;because it is undermining that independence in several ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, this government has gravely damaged Australia's real sovereignty through the abject failure of its economic policies which have led to a seven-fold increase in Australia's debt to the rest of the world since Labor came to power in 1983 to a figure that now exceeds $200 billion in gross terms. That figure compares with a figure of the order of $30 billion&mdash;a very manageable figure&mdash;when the Fraser government went out of office in March 1983. So that is a quite fundamental undermining of our real sovereignty and independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But Senator Bolkus may also have been referring&mdash;again, I doubt it very much&mdash;to the fact that this government of his is progressively undermining Australia's independence and sovereignty through its quite obsessive reliance on external treaties as a basis for its domestic policies. Labor seems to have become obsessed with handing over moral, if not legal, authority for our domestic affairs to unrepresentative, unelected international committees which hand down decisions and judgments on our domestic laws. If that is the thrust of Senator Bolkus's remarks, I suggest he hotfoot it posthaste to his Prime Minister and to the rest of the Keating government and take up this matter to stop this insidious transfer of our legal independence to overseas interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude with the remark I made at the start. I find it absolutely extraordinary and inexplicable that a minister of the crown could, on such a significant occasion as the launch of a citizenship campaign&mdash;significant because of the effort that the government put into it and significant because of the importance of citizenship&mdash;describe Australia, `as an independent nation in all but law'. </PARA>
