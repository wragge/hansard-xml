<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I am very pleased to table the report by the Joint Standing Committee on Migration entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australians all, enhancing Australian citizenship</EMPHASIS>. The report is a comprehensive analysis of Australian citizenship law and practice. It contains 56 recommendations aimed at strengthening and revitalising Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Throughout the inquiry, the committee perceived a genuine community interest in raising awareness of and understanding about Australian citizenship. The committee is sympathetic to the view expressed in a number of submissions that, if Australian citizenship is to carry enhanced meaning, the foundation stone of that citizenship, namely, the Australian Citizenship Act, should be accessible and easily understood by those who already are and those who aspire to be Australian citizens. In this regard the committee has recommended: a redraft of the Citizenship Act by 1999, the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship; a redraft of the citizenship regulations so that they operate as a comprehensive, accessible and easily understood guide in relation to citizenship; production of a reader's guide to the Citizenship Act and regulations; and production of a citizenship booklet for wide public distribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To enhance the symbolic meaning of the Citizenship Act, the committee has proposed that the preamble to the Citizenship Act be revised and expanded so that it is based on certain fundamental principles of Australian society as enunciated in the National Agenda for a Multicultural Australia. Much of the evidence to the inquiry indicated that increasing community awareness about citizenship is the best way to enhance its meaning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee agrees with the sentiment expressed in a variety of submissions that those who are well informed about the meaning of citizenship are more likely to become citizens, and that well-informed citizens are more likely to become active citizens who participate in and contribute effectively to the community. Accordingly, the committee has recommended the development and implementation of a broad-based education and information program on citizenship, including: citizenship courses for migrants of English and non-English speaking background; and a national curriculum for citizenship education, to be implemented as a national priority through the school system.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also has recommended the development and implementation of a national strategy for citizenship promotion which should include: a national citizenship week held on an annual basis; national citizenship awards; and a year of Australian citizenship in 1999, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also has targeted citizenship ceremonies for improvement by recommending that: citizenship be conferred principally at public ceremonies; prescribed minimum guidelines be established for the conduct of citizenship ceremonies; the guidelines for the conduct of citizenship ceremonies be updated regularly, and include suggestions for improving the meaning of those ceremonies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee considered the legislative provisions governing the acquisition and loss of citizenship. Many of these matters are of a technical nature. The broad thrust of the committee's recommendations on Australian citizenship law are to simplify and clarify the residence requirement for grant of citizenship; retain the existing rules for acquisition of citizenship by birth; retain the existing requirement for registration of children born overseas to Australian citizens, but extend the concession for those who are not registered by the time they turn 18 years of age; increase the powers of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to revoke citizenship where that citizenship is based on permanent residence gained by fraud; waive the citizenship application fee for British child migrants; and extend the Defence Force concession. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the core criteria for the grant of citizenship, the committee notes in its report that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus) indicated at the outset of the inquiry that those criteria were not in need of amendment. Indeed, limited evidence on the criteria was received by the committee. Nevertheless, it is evident that there is a variety of views in the community about those criteria. For this reason, the committee has proposed that a review of the core criteria be conducted in the lead-up to the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship in 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also examined the administrative arrangements for the processing of citizenship applications. The committee found that the acquisition of citizenship by grant involves a streamlined administrative process aimed at producing a speedy determination with minimal inconvenience to the applicant. While the committee commends the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs for establishing such a system, the committee is concerned that the system may have become too focused on administrative processing and insufficiently focused on the careful evaluation of applicants for citizenship. Accordingly, the committee has recommended upgraded citizenship interviews to provide for careful and thorough evaluation of the criteria for grant of citizenship; enhanced guidelines for officers conducting citizenship interviews; and greater emphasis on immigration status, character and security checking of citizenship applicants, with access by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to a comprehensive and up-to-date national index of criminal activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also has recommended a six-month time limit from when citizenship is granted to when it must be conferred; a specific power for the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to revoke citizenship certificates before citizenship is conferred; improved practice for ensuring the enrolment of new citizens on the electoral roll; and on-line access to the records of state registrars of births, deaths and marriages for the purpose of passport issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To further enhance the meaning of citizenship, the committee has proposed that greater prominence should be given to citizenship within the existing portfolio arrangements. As the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs itself told the committee, we should stop thinking about citizenship as something that migrants get. The committee has recommended that the department responsible for administering the Citizenship Act should be renamed the department of citizenship, immigration and ethnic affairs. This will help all Australians to recognise that citizenship is a matter of significance to the Commonwealth and will ensure that Australians are readily able to identify which Commonwealth agency is responsible for citizenship matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with this recommendation, the committee considers that it would be more appropriate for all the functions associated with citizenship to be controlled by one Commonwealth department. For this reason, the committee has recommended that the government consider transferring responsibility for administration of the passport function to a renamed department of citizenship, immigration and ethnic affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of dual citizenship attracted considerable attention during the inquiry. The overwhelming view of submissions was that Australia's insistence on single citizenship for those born in Australia is outmoded and discriminatory. In a world of increasing mobility, it was considered anachronistic that one section of the Australian population should be disadvantaged by a prohibition on accessing more than one citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing legislation has long accepted dual citizenship. It is only fair and equitable that the opportunity to acquire the citizenship of another country should be extended to all Australian citizens. Accordingly, the committee has recommended the repeal of section 17 of the Citizenship Act, thereby allowing Australian citizens to acquire dual citizenship. The committee also has recommended that those who have lost Australian citizenship under section 17 have the unqualified right to apply for the resumption of their Australian citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tolerance of diversity is a cornerstone of a multicultural Australian society. The ultimate expression of such tolerance would be the recognition that while Australian citizens owe their primary allegiance to Australia, they also can show a commitment to their country of origin or the country in which they are resident. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Extension of time granted)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As chairman of the committee, and on behalf of the committee, I wish to express my sincere appreciation to all those who contributed to this inquiry, be it by way of submission or appearance before the committee at public hearings. I thank my fellow committee members, particularly the deputy chairman, Senator Short. Special thanks also are due to the committee secretary, Mr Andres Lomp, who is here in the advisers gallery; the committee's legal adviser, Dr Kathryn Cronin; the inquiry staff, Mr Stephen Boyd, Ms Dianne Fraser and Mr Pete Tighe; as well as the committee's parliamentary intern, Ms Rosemary Van Der Meer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of Australian citizenship may be brief, but all Australians can be proud of that citizenship and what it represents. Australian citizenship is a symbol of unity in a multicultural society which draws strength from diversity. Adoption of the committee's recommendations will enhance Australian citizenship as we, Australians all, prepare to meet the challenges of the new century. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this is a very important report because the issue of citizenship really goes very much to the whole core of what it means to be Australian, what we feel about Australia, what being an Australian citizen means and what the term citizenship means. It was very interesting, we found as members of the committee, to see the differing views that were expressed in the wide number of submissions that we received as to what was really meant by citizenship and the values of citizenship. Interestingly, the first paragraph of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No substantive evidence was presented to indicate that the meaning of Australian citizenship would be enhanced if citizenship was of greater practical value. Indeed, the Committee is sympathetic to the view that an individual's desire to acquire citizenship should be based on a person's sense of commitment to Australia rather than a person's desire to secure particular benefits for himself/herself or his/her family.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the members of the committee individually supported that view, which was heavily reflected in the submissions that we received. I hope the report reflects that, essentially, citizenship is really all about a commitment to Australia and to the basic, core values that most Australians accept. Whilst they often find these hard to define, almost innately they know what they mean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important point that came forward and that I would like to emphasise&mdash;and Senator McKiernan commented on this in his remarks&mdash;is that citizenship is more than just for migrants to Australia. At the moment the only people who actually receive a citizenship certificate are those who are granted citizenship by virtue of coming to Australia, meeting the residential requirements of a minimum of two years, applying for citizenship, attending a citizenship ceremony and being granted citizenship. All the rest of us, who were born in Australia, never go through that and, therefore, we take citizenship more for granted and perhaps with a bit of a yawn than those who come to our shores and actually go through the act of taking citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Various submissions were received, very interestingly, through an organisation chaired by Sir Ninian Stephen and other organisations. Various suggestions were made as to how the concept of citizenship in a practical way could be made more significant for us&mdash;I do not mean by practical benefits, but in bringing it home to us that we are Australian citizens even though we have not, as Australian-born citizens, gone through the actual process of being granted citizenship. I think that is something we ought to look at more as a parliament and as a nation in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will highlight just a few of the 56 important recommendations made by the committee. Recommendations 10 and 11 deal with the question of guidelines for the conduct of citizenship ceremonies which must be followed by the minister's delegate conducting the ceremonies. I think that is a very important point. As members of parliament, we all too often, quite rightly, receive complaints from people who have gone through citizenship ceremonies. People tell us what a deadly, dull, boring process it was and that they came away feeling very disappointed. They go through an event which is a very important step in their life, but they leave feeling that they had to sit through a pretty pathetic performance. As a committee, we believe that there should be a set of minimum guidelines that need to be met in terms of the conduct of citizenship ceremonies. I think that is a very important point. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 11&mdash;and I think it is an important one too because I hope it will help upgrade the level of the citizenship ceremonies&mdash;is that the Commonwealth government should provide a subsidy for citizenship ceremonies to those local government authorities which conduct public citizenship ceremonies in accordance with the prescribed guidelines. At the moment, local government bears the full cost. As local government is doing this as the delegate, in effect, of the Commonwealth, it is right that it should be paid an appropriate subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 16 is important. It recommends that the Citizenship Act be redrafted, using simple language and being recast in modern legal drafting style. It recommends that this rewriting be in place for the 50th anniversary of Australian citizenship in 1999. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 28 is also important. It deals with the review of the core criteria for citizenship and recommends that such review be conducted in the lead-up to the 50th anniversary. Some of us had difficulty in coming to grips with those core criteria. Therefore, this area certainly needs to be looked at and given careful re-evaluation and review over the period leading up to the 50th anniversary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation for upgrading interviews for citizenship applications is another important recommendation. Concern was expressed by members of the committee and by some of those making submissions to it about the quality of the interview process that applicants have to go through in order to acquire citizenship. It is a very important thing that they are seeking and we should all be sure that they have been subjected to the necessary quality of interview before being deemed eligible for the grant of citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan mentioned the recommendation to rename the department to include the word `citizenship'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I draw the attention of all Australians to the recommendations in relation to dual citizenship, particularly that section 17 of the Citizenship Act be repealed so that Australians who wish to take citizenship of another country are able to do that while retaining their own Australian citizenship. It is estimated that there are almost three million Australians who are already dual citizens by virtue of having been born overseas. It seems appropriate and equitable that the opportunity for dual citizenship be extended to Australian-born citizens. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to say something about this essential report of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, and I use the word `essential' advisedly. There is a legal concept to citizenship but, more importantly, there is also a spiritual one. There must be a moving of the heart and soul towards those qualities that make the ideal Australian community. That is the basis of this report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The qualities which make the ideal Australian community include: our unity as a people; a culture with a vast range of roots; the universal reign of tolerance and legal equality between all people; the rule of law and the predominance of high principles. That concept underlies this excellent report on citizenship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of the report's recommendations might seem to be mundane but they are not so if we consider what gives rise to them. As Senator Short said, citizenship is a matter that we should take very seriously. Perhaps we do not take it as seriously as we should. If we did, the recommendations in this report would make a great deal of sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have in Australia a very rich culture that has been brought here by people from many lands. The chairperson of this committee is Senator Jim McKiernan, who, may I say, Mr Deputy President, as you know, turned 50 yesterday, quite a young age to be in this place but, nevertheless, an important milestone. He came from Ireland, which has, amongst other nations, produced people over the years in this country that have done great things for it. Of course, if we go back to the last century many a person came in all sorts of ways to this country whose descendants have contributed mightily to this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a pity if the concepts of Australian citizenship stopped with this report. I see this report as a basis for further consideration about citizenship. As I say, it would be a pity if we got tangled into legal concepts of who is a citizen and who is not and what should be done to the person who is not a citizen but is in Australia. Those things are necessary matters to take on board in underpinning a much higher consideration that should be given to what we are as an Australian nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that Senator McKiernan and Senator Short have covered the essential thrust of the report.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the motion that Senator Teague presented yesterday relating to the declaration made by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) on 10 July 1994. The Greens (WA) most certainly do not support the disallowance motion. It is true that there has been some concern, but Professor Cheryl Saunders actually made the point in her report that it was inevitable that the outcome of the report would not be pleasing to everybody. She said that, whatever the outcome, there would be great disappointment on the part of some, and she hoped that the divisions would be healed in time and that planning for the future would be made possible through constructive cooperation, drawing on the lessons of the past.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many lessons to learn from this particular decision. I have received some letters protesting the outcome of Professor Saunders's report, which was that Mr Tickner, the federal minister for Aboriginal affairs, placed a protection order over the sacred sites at Goolwa and Kumarangk, the Hindmarsh Island in South Australia. I have also been privileged to visit the area and meet hundreds of people who were deeply concerned at the extent to which development was going to affect that area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People may know that the area under consideration is unique. The area&mdash;the Murray mouth and the Coorong&mdash;is of national importance. Some honourable senators will be familiar with the movie <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Storm Boy</EMPHASIS>, which demonstrated the unique environmental features and the beauty of this place. Environmentalists have been struggling to make sure that the encroachment of a bridge and development on Hindmarsh Island does not destroy the environmental features of this area. So its environmental values are well known. Lesser known, but of even greater importance, is the history of this place and the Aboriginal significance of this area&mdash;in particular, its significance to Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Teague talked about the fact that these women's issues had not been heard of until April of this year, four years after the proposals had been through some form of environmental scrutiny and assessment and the approval to go ahead had been, at least in part, given. I think that illustrates a very serious problem about the ways in which the state Labor government of that time actually addressed the issues of this unique and important area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The various decisions that had been made prior to a proper and adequate consultation should prompt questions about the process that led to the approval of the bridge development in the first place. It is quite clear that the process failed to take full account of either environmental considerations or Aboriginal considerations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was very concerned about some of the comments that Senator Teague made. In referring to the Saunders report, he said that the personal consultations that Professor Saunders had with women and also the protected and confidential nature of the disclosures she received were the flimsiest basis for the protection order. I think everybody who knows anything about this issue would be offended by that statement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to know whether Senator Teague has discussed the situation with his wife, who is a personal friend of mine and who I know would have similar values. I think it is impertinent for men who know that this area has major Aboriginal significance to Aboriginal women to declare as `flimsy' evidence that they have not seen. It is an extremely important area. On page 2 of her report, Professor Saunders said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the custodians of this knowledge described the area to me as "the most important place for the Aboriginal people of the Lower South".</PARA>
<PARA>That is both men and women. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Viewed from this perspective, the bridge presents a threat to the area in the form of a permanent prominent and physical link above the water between two parts of the territory which would, in accordance with Ngarrindjeri tradition, render the cosmos, and human beings within it, "sterile" and unable to reproduce. The Ngarrindjeri women believe that construction of the bridge would not only injure and desecrate their traditions but destroy their culture . . . Within Aboriginal tradition, the specifics of this knowledge may not be passed onto a man.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is very important that we respect that and that we also respect the integrity and the credibility of Professor Cheryl Saunders and her inquiry. I have talked to women of this area and I can confirm that it is of extremely great importance to them. I believe that Aboriginal spirituality and historical tradition will be affected&mdash;no doubt they have already been affected because this area is the burial site of many Aboriginal people. As Aboriginal people would point out to us, `We don't come and desecrate your cemeteries, but you want to desecrate our burial sites with your developments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Destruction of Aboriginal women's spirituality has already occurred. I think it would be a loss for all Australians if we allowed further damage and desecration to take place. It would be our loss because we would be damaging our own integrity as a nation by not respecting what we would respect within our own culture in terms of our own burial sites and our own cemeteries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The letters that I received indicate that some people are concerned. They believe the reports of the people who favour the development, that Goolwa and district will suffer economic losses of $175 million and 1,200 jobs. I remind senators that there is no loss involved here; all it is, is savings. It is prevention of an expenditure of $175 million which will destroy not only Aboriginal heritage but Australian national heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might add that the site is already known as a unique tourist attraction. People flood to that area to see the unique qualities represented there. I think it would interfere with a great deal more of the development of that area to use such an important area as a bridge site that brings development to the island which damages both the environment and the Aboriginal significance of the area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reconciliation will continue. We have to recognise that, while some people are extremely bitter that Aboriginal voices have been listened to at this time, it has been one of the most important steps in the reconciliation process that the minister for aboriginal affairs has heeded the voices of the Ngarrindjeri people. He has responded to the views of the Ngarrindjeri women, has stored them for posterity by having obtained such a detailed and thorough report, and has allowed protection of that area for 25 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The view of the environment and conservation movement, which failed to protect the environmental significance of the area and was under great threat from the state government and the developers because of legal sanctions, has declared this as very positive. It is not just a decision about Hindmarsh Island, those people say, but a just decision. I will quote the spokesperson for the council, David Shearman. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Significant harm to the Ngarrindjeri people, the Aboriginal community in general, the reconciliation process and the fragile environment of Hindmarsh Island has been avoided.</PARA>
<PARA>In his press release he went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Conservation Council recognises the sensitivities of State Rights versus Federal decisions, but there will always be occasions when for reasons of environmental damage or human rights, a national approach has to be taken. The State Government was too locked in legally to be able to make the appropriate decisions.</PARA>
<PARA>We hope that the extensive investigations by Professor Saunders, an independent legal expert, will be the first step in the healing process whereby the entire community can move forward together to provide a fruitful, environmentally wise and economically sustainable future for the Murray mouth region. Draft plans for appropriate development are already available which have the support of the Ngarrindjeri people and environmentalists. Dr Shearman concludes by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let us thank Mr Tickner for a wise and just decision, analyse our mistakes, avoid recrimination and move forward to appropriate development based on our shared heritage which can therefore be supported by all the community.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a very important feature. We could not hope to have reconciliation without restoration of historical justice. Desecration of a sacred burial site, a site of extreme and private significance to Aboriginal women, is not compatible with restoration of historical justice. Any reconciliation process which allows desecration to happen first cannot be  true reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last weekend I met some Aboriginal women in Adelaide at the women's conference. They expressed joy at the positive steps that have been taken by the protection of their area. They say that reconciliation is moving on apace thanks to the intervention by the minister for Aboriginal affairs, Robert Tickner, and this protection order. That is why the Greens have no intention of supporting any disallowance of what we see as a very valuable step forward in the history of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise also to oppose this disallowance motion. I noted Senator Teague's disparagement in his speech yesterday of the Aboriginal claims. I begin by drawing attention to the speech which was made by the Hon. Dr Michael Armitage, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the South Australian parliament, a Liberal parliament, when he gave permission for the damage of the Aboriginal sites on Hindmarsh Island.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note what Dr Armitage said because, quite clearly, the Liberal government recognised the importance of these Aboriginal sites, recognised that it was in a difficult situation with respect to contracts entered into in the dying moments of the previous Labor government in South Australia and was really doing a balancing act. It was with great reluctance, in recognition of the importance of the sites, that the minister gave this order. I would like to read some of what he had to say. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I rise to inform the House that I have today reluctantly issued an authorisation to the Department of Road Transport to allow damage to Aboriginal sites to the minimal extent necessary to allow the construction of a bridge to Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that later. Clearly the bridge, in giving increased access to the island, would be a prelude to much more extensive damage occurring on Hindmarsh Island. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This authority has been given under s.23 of the Aboriginal Heritage Act following consultations with the Aboriginal community and further archaeological site work.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister went on to say that it was a personal decision. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have come to this decision aware of these facts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet, it gave me no pleasure to make this decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the Government has explored all legal measures to extricate ourselves from this difficult situation.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Armitage is drawing attention there to the fact that clearly he recognises the importance of these sites to the Aboriginal people, but also recognises that the South Australian government was in a situation not of its making but in which it found itself as a consequence of decisions of the previous Labor government. He then said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I recognise that Aboriginal sites will be damaged by the construction&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring there to the construction of the bridge, and I will return to the further construction on Hindmarsh Island that this bridge would have caused had it been allowed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and that this fact causes great distress to the Aboriginal community.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite contrary to what Senator Teague was saying yesterday, even the Liberal government in South Australia recognised that the decision to go ahead with the bridge would cause great distress to the Aboriginal community. The minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee, representing the Ngarrindjeri people, remains implacably opposed to the construction of the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have met with representatives of the Committee on at least four occasions and discussed their concerns. My staff and I have had numerous written and telephone communications with members of the Committee and their legal representatives. All of these communications leave me in no doubt of the Aboriginal opposition to the construction of the bridge and that the community will be extremely disappointed.</PARA>
<PARA>I stress again that that was the Liberal Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the difficult situation in which he found himself. With great reluctance he signed that order to allow what he clearly recognised would result in significant damage to sites which were important to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the claims which have been made by Senator Teague in relation to the smallness and the inadequacy, as he put it, of the Aboriginal women's claims really stand up. We have evidence from essentially Senator Teague's own side of politics saying that there was recognition of the very great significance of Hindmarsh Island to the Aboriginal people and the destruction which would be caused by the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I took the position of supporting the Aboriginal people in relation to this claim, I was written to by a number of people from Hindmarsh Island and the Goolwa region, objecting to the position which I had taken and claiming, together with some documentary evidence, that not to build the bridge would result in very significant financial damage to those people, particularly to the people on the island. Amongst other things, it was claimed that there was some $80 million worth of speculative gain to be made from land subdivision on Hindmarsh Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it rather strange that only yesterday the opposition, in the form of Senator Michael Baume, criticised the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for buying an expensive house in Sydney and engaging in property development&mdash;whereas the Prime Minister was saying, quite correctly, that money should be put into productive investment and not into speculation. Yet the opposition is evidently supporting the investment of $80 million not in actual development of property but in property speculation by way of land sales on Hindmarsh Island. I would have thought the opposition would be opposed to the redirection of $80 million into property speculation instead of into productive investment. I think the opposition is being quite inconsistent with respect to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the issue of what will actually happen as a consequence of this bridge being built. We need to look no further than a letter written to me by the District Council of Port Elliot and Goolwa. I refer to a number of paragraphs which clearly indicate that the District Council of Port Elliot and Goolwa saw the construction of this bridge as a prelude to massive development on Hindmarsh Island, with housing developments, marinas, hotels, motels and convention centres; in other words, the turning of Hindmarsh Island essentially into a mini Gold Coast. Anybody would see that that is inconsistent with the environmental qualities of Hindmarsh Island, the important wetlands which surround it and the protection of the Aboriginal heritage of the area. I quote from some paragraphs contained in the letter from the District Council of Port Elliot and Goolwa:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is increasing pressure for development of housing on waterfront land in the region due to the substantial development of existing foreshore and riverside residential land elsewhere on the Encounter coast. Because of the existence of extensive shoreline and low level depressions on Hindmarsh Island the emphasis on new development to accommodate both housing and boat moorings is shifting to the Island.</PARA>
<PARA>Well before this, there were already four proposals, going back as far as 1988, for very extensive marina developments associated with motels and restaurants, accommodating many hundreds of boats and houses. Clearly, the council is supporting this type of development. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only road access to Hindmarsh Island is provided by means of a ferry crossing at Goolwa. The ferry is operated by the Department of Road Transport and provides a continuous service carrying approximately 12 normal sized motor cars with a cycle time of 9 to 10 minutes. This service is adequate for normal purposes&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>And I draw attention to that comment; clearly, the council recognises that the ferry service is adequate for the present development on Hindmarsh Island&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but with the development of the Island&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>This is what is being anticipated; this is the point that needs to be stressed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">for recreational, tourist and residential use the ferry crossing becomes over taxed during peak periods causing lengthy delays in crossing.</PARA>
<PARA>The council is clearly not looking on the bridge simply as access to the one marina, the Binalong marina which was the subject of the agreement between the former Labor government in South Australia and Binalong, but is looking for much more extensive development which would make the ferry service inadequate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore the council is anticipating not just the construction of the bridge and the damage that that would do to the Aboriginal sites, but also further encroachment onto the island with recreational, tourist and residential use, and the ferry would then become inadequate. The council goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The visitor interest is derived from. . . the natural environment and in particular the bird life which breeds in and frequents the wetlands and waters around Hindmarsh Island.</PARA>
<PARA>The council recognises the environmental importance of the island. The council further says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Increasing pressure from visitors can be expected due to the proximity of the Island to a growing metropolitan population.</PARA>
<PARA>The council is recognising the increasing pressure and it wants to shift that pressure onto the island by building a bridge and giving greater access; yet in the previous paragraph the council has recognised the environmental importance of Hindmarsh Island. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. I would say that they were either naive or dissimulating when they were attempting to argue that this heavy development, which they clearly anticipate, is consistent with environmental protection. We have repeatedly seen that that type of heavy development is not consistent with environmental protection; with the birdlife and the wetlands and so on which the council has identified. Therefore I believe that they are inconsistent and not to be taken seriously when they are supporting the bridge and the development which they clearly anticipate would follow. The council continues:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the South Coast area has expanded rapidly to become one of the fastest growing urban areas within South Australia. The District Council of Port Elliot and Goolwa increased its population by 22.4% from the census of 1986 to the census of 1991. This has resulted in increased demand for permanent accommodation and it is predicted that this trend will continue. Council has supported the further development of allotments on Hindmarsh Island due to the attractiveness of the Island, its potential for waterfront development and the marginal nature of agricultural land on the Island. Development should be pursued and encouraged on the Island so that prime agricultural land in other parts of the Council area is not lost to the State needlessly.</PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, the council is anticipating that the agricultural practices on the island are going to be replaced by housing, and that the agricultural practices will shift elsewhere. Again I stress that that is not consistent with the protection of the island for either its environmental values or the values which the Aboriginal people quite significantly have placed on the island, and to which Dr Armitage has drawn our attention.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will enable development by way of subdivision of land on land which is marginal agriculturally but physically attractive and stop development of prime agricultural land.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, we see this shift from agricultural activities on the island to the mainland and the substitution of those agricultural activities by intensive development on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely clear from these paragraphs that the building of the bridge was and is in the minds of its supporters, both those on the island who hope to make $80 million worth of speculative gain from subdivision and the members of the council, a precondition for rapid subdivision and development of the island&mdash;a development which, as I have indicated, in my view, and I think in the view of any dispassionate observer, is quite inconsistent with the protection of those environmental and Aboriginal values which the order of the minister seeks to protect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also clear from so many examples that, under pressures already present among those who want to develop the island, the protection of culturally significant sites, wetlands and the environment generally would become an impossibility and we would finish up seeing a Gold Coast type development on Hindmarsh Island, unless this order by the minister is upheld. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have no intention whatsoever of supporting this motion for disallowance. We see the conflict as much wider than the bridge. Senator Baden Teague yesterday tried to narrow the debate down to simply a bridge; yet, as I think I have shown quite convincingly, the bridge is really only a beginning to a much more extensive development. Importantly, it is that more extensive development which would damage those sites of environmental and Aboriginal significance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole area of the lower Murray&mdash;together with Hindmarsh Island, the Murray mouth and the two peninsulas framing the mouth and the Coorong&mdash;has been occupied by a large population of Aboriginal people for many thousands of years. I do not think that is really in contention. It is of undoubted and very great significance to these Aboriginal people, especially to Aboriginal women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have drawn attention again to Dr Armitage's reluctant announcement that he was prepared to damage these sites of significance because of the difficult financial situation in which the South Australian government found itself. The situation is one which, I believe, the federal government has extricated the South Australian government from. I am rather surprised at its present position; I would have thought it would have been quite pleased that it did not have to proceed with the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only has the area provided extremely well for these Aboriginal people in terms of basic sustenance, but also it has acquired this deep spiritual ambience. It generates in Aboriginal people, and in those non-Aboriginal people who understand, this same sense of reverence and respect which many white people would feel when they visit a great church or a cemetery. Having been with Aboriginal people on Hindmarsh Island, down through the Coorong and onto Younghusband Peninsula, one gets a sense of this reverence felt by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just as one would not put ice-cream booths and pizza bars between the headstones of a cemetery, for reasons that Jesus turned the money changers away from the temple, so we should recognise that the developments anticipated for the area as a direct consequence of the building of the bridge&mdash;and they are the developments to which I referred earlier, which are in the council's own document&mdash;are inappropriate for this area of special significance to the Aboriginal people. That these analogies are not seen by those who would cover the island with houses and marinas is a form of covert racism. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the Aboriginal people should be acceptable as equals. That is the view of those who would argue for the bridge and for the development. They are saying that Aboriginal people are acceptable as equals, provided they behave and exhibit exactly the same value system as the dominant white culture. Hopefully, we have moved beyond that with the moves towards ATSIC, towards reconciliation and towards the land fund, which we may get to debate later this week. There must be within the total Australian society a recognition of the legitimacy of the alternative Aboriginal cultural system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, I would go further: I believe that we need to adopt some of those same values of reverence for land and the environment into the mainstream. That would be of great benefit to the dominant culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If reconciliation is to mean anything, it is my firm belief that there must be a two-way movement with the dominant culture moving towards the indigenous culture as well as the Aboriginal moving towards the mainstream. In a sense, the Hindmarsh Island debate is in microcosm a symptom of what is happening in the larger community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dominant culture is consumerist and exploitative&mdash;everything is tradeable. Of course, we see that in the attitude of the council and of those who would develop land on Hindmarsh Island. Land is simply a commodity to be traded, to be turned into $80 million worth of profit through subdivision. It does not have a reverence attached to it which is part of the Aboriginal view. Land and nature are clearly, in this view, commodities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increasingly, we in the white society are recognising that these attitudes have to change, that Western industrial economic systems that represent the fullest expression of these attitudes are indeed wrecking the environment, as they would on Hindmarsh Island, and they are doing this both locally and globally. The environment movement in many ways is a movement back towards those values which allowed indigenous people to live somewhere near balance with the environment for countless thousands of years. Indigenous people achieved this balance by imbuing the physical world with spiritual values and invoking spiritual sanctions for transgression. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pause here to reflect again on Senator Baden Teague's speech yesterday when he seemed to be arguing that, because the Aboriginal views were, by his standards, in some way irrational, they were to be discounted. I would have thought that if one looked closely, from the point of view of pure rationality, at many of the beliefs in the Christian religion, one would say they are totally irrational. But people hold those views and I think they have a perfect right to have those views accepted with reverence and with respect by others, whether or not they hold those views themselves. The rationality of a view is, I believe, not to be questioned in relation to a religious view.</PARA>

It is not surprising, therefore, that around many of the conservation battles&mdash;and Senator Teague himself drew attention to this&mdash;there is now a growing convergence of the environment movement and Aboriginal people. I found it really very stimulating to go down to Hindmarsh Island to meet with both white people and Aboriginal people and to see the convergence of the concerns which both sides have for the island. The white people, for their part, were developing that same sense of reverence for the land and the environment which is an integral part of Aboriginal culture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my hope that this development portends a similar movement in the wider community. For this balance will not only provide the legitimacy and acceptance of Aboriginal values, which I see as an important part of the reconciliation process, but also provide to the new and emergent culture within Australia those values which will underpin environmental protection and, ultimately, underpin our own human survival. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the argument favouring the bridge comes from those who stand to gain some material advantage, while the argument on the other side comes from those with nothing to gain whatsoever, only a share of what they perceive as the common good. And I believe that this makes the latter position much more believable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the argument for the bridge is deceptively naive&mdash;perhaps deliberately so. It is claimed that the bridge will disturb only two sites&mdash;and we heard this from Senator Teague: those containing the footings and bridge approaches. It has been claimed that through strong planning, a bridge could be built without that leading to any further subdivision of land on the island or to any more marinas. This position has been put to me quite strongly by some of the people on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet that is totally denied in those clauses which I have read from the council's statement. I believe this is political naivety at its worst. Once better access is provided, the pressure to exploit the island and the area to the south-east, involving the Coorong and Younghusband Peninsula, would be irresistible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988, and I referred to this earlier, the Binalong development&mdash;with 670 residential allotments around an artificial lake, 170 residential apartments, a marina with 1,150 moorings, 500 dry-stand berths, shops, a motel and a chandlery&mdash;was being seriously entertained by the then Labor minister for the environment in South Australia, even though the development plan showed the area as non-urban. At that stage, he was suggesting a rezoning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, several proposals were under consideration through the rezoning process: a proposal for Narnu waterways, with 700 allotments around an artificial lake, a marina and a restaurant; a proposal for 400 allotments and a marina on the north-eastern shore; and a proposal for 200 to 250 allotments on a series of artificial canals, with a wilderness lodge, a motel, a restaurant and a convention centre opposite the Murray mouth. Much of the pressure for the bridge comes from these sources. It is inconceivable to think that, once the bridge was built, this pressure would not be successful in achieving these subdivisions, with many more subdivisions extending across the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increased population pressure would clearly impact adversely on those very values that Aboriginal people and the conservation movement are working so hard to retain and protect. This much larger population would not only lead to the despoliation of the island, but the new residents would seek recreation and penetrate further, and in larger numbers, into the Coorong and onto the Younghusband Peninsula, both areas of great significance to Aboriginal people and the environment movement. There is already marked pollution of the lower Murray and Coorong because of the number of boats using these waterways&mdash;from the rubbish which is thrown overboard which causes a hazard to wildlife as well as visual pollution in the water and along the shorelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable further consequences of the greater access provided by the bridge are of greater significance. One cannot retain the awe and inspiration of a cathedral with the tables of the money changers between the pews; nor can one retain the reverence of a cemetery with snack bars between the gravestones; nor, I would submit, can the dignity of Aboriginal people be maintained and their important land values protected if areas of such deep significance are covered with houses, artificial lakes, motels, shops, restaurants and convention centres. We will strongly and continually oppose this disallowance motion. </PARA>

It is very strange that Senator Teague should move a motion to disallow the declaration to stop the bridge being built when his own leader, to say the least, is utterly unenthusiastic about it, his leader in South Australia when he was Leader of the Opposition was unenthusiastic about it and opposed it, and his own shadow minister for the environment clearly does not believe in it. </PARA>

After this debate had been going on for four or five years in South Australia, with no satisfactory resolution&mdash;and this had been a major political issue on which people were contradicting each other and changing positions&mdash;Mr Tickner was requested, as he was required to do under the act that this parliament has carried and that he is responsible for, to carry out his duty and appointed a very appropriate person to do an independent survey, an independent investigation, of all the facts. The person whom the minister appointed and whose integrity one cannot impeach made a report, carried out the purpose of the act and made a decision that is supported by  this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the perceptions of Senator Campbell, others and now Senator Teague, it is very unfortunate that the decision overrides states rights, but so be it. The sooner this country moves away from the dead hand of the ideology of states rights, the sooner this country will do a lot better. I know Senator Teague believes in that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This motion is about much more than just building a bridge. This is about a question of process and a question of power exercised by a federal minister. It is a question I thought the government party would have been most interested in, as process is one of the tenets that it holds dear. The question here is whether the disallowance made by the minister in relation to the building of this bridge to Hindmarsh Island is indeed a proper declaration. The motion proposes that it is not and that it should be disallowed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter has ramifications for the whole of Australia. Recently in Western Australia the minister made a similar declaration in relation to the extension of the Broome crocodile farm. Senators might not think there is much relationship between a crocodile farm and a bridge, but the common denominator is the action that was taken by the minister, and it is that action which is the cause for concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 12 May this year Minister Tickner issued a stop order on the continued construction of a bridge to Hindmarsh Island in South Australia. As such, the bridge had been approved by a state Labor government and, what is more, was approved by a Liberal state government. The company concerned was put into receivership as a result of that stop order by the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This situation is akin to a citizen gaining consent from a local council to build extensions to his house and then entering into a contract with a builder to carry out that work. Whilst those extensions are under way or half way through, it is tantamount to the council saying, `You've got to stop.' Where does that leave the citizen? The citizen is left financially disadvantaged, and in such a case one has a complete lack of process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a moment I will refer to the history of this matter, but I will not deal with the personalities and individual philosophies of people whom Senator Schacht mentioned. I bow to the local knowledge of Senator Teague, who has outlined the local issues so well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must look at the history of this matter. This matter goes back to 1977, because it was in 1977 that the company concerned purchased land on the western portion of Hindmarsh Island. From then on, planning took place. A marina was planned. Submissions were put to the state planning authority. In 1983, work commenced on the site. In 1987, pressure was applied for the construction of a bridge. At that stage there was a ferry service in operation which I understand cost in the region of $400,000 a year. In 1988, a further global plan was produced, with the undertaking by the state government that a bridge could be built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were two Aboriginal anthropological studies carried out, by a Ms Edwards and a Mr Lucas. They were carried out in 1989 and 1990. There was also an environmental impact study placed on display. It was advertised; and that was completed the following year. So in 1991 most of the hurdles had been negotiated and the contract for the building of the bridge was let.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, as I understand it, the government indicated that the bridge would be built by 1993. In December 1993 a Liberal government was elected and while it sought advice on the matter construction was stalled but it recommenced after an independent opinion was provided by Mr Jacobs QC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this indicates is that from 1977 to 1993 this developer had gone through all the process demanded of the developer&mdash;environmental impact statements, Aboriginal anthropological studies, town planning approval, all the usual things that we would expect. So we had the bridge under construction and then bang&mdash;the guillotine fell on 12 May 1994 when Minister Tickner issued a 30-day stop order without any consultation, without reports, and he then ordered an independent inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might say that this matter is before the Federal Court in South Australia where it is alleged that Minister Tickner drafted the order to suspend work for 25 years before he had even obtained the independent report. That is a question of process which is of grave concern. It is not a question of states rights in relation to that aspect; it is a question of whether the minister used his powers properly. These powers are comprehensive ones&mdash;powers which can stop construction midway; powers which can send a company into receivership. No doubt the Federal Court will examine that matter in due course and come to a determination. I might add that Minister Tickner's decision to halt the development of the Broome crocodile farm under similar circumstances is also under review by the Federal Court in Western Australia. I await with great interest the result of those judgments in relation to the exercise of the minister's powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of states rights was raised by Senator Schacht. It is an inherent aspect of this Federation that the state governments have control over certain areas of good and proper government for the citizens of the states. There is no question, I put to the Senate, that the states should not govern things like law and order, main roads, the distribution of power and the general day-to-day things that affect the citizens of this country. Similarly, in this case, the state government of the day had allowed progress on this development and these various plans were approved. The developer had gone through all the usual channels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the eleventh hour we find a federal minister riding roughshod over the due process and interfering. I put it to the Senate that this power contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act 1984 is a power which has to be used with great care and great caution. During the process of approval for this bridge none of the Aboriginal concerns were raised; they were only raised in the last 12 months. Remember I said that this went back to 1977. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case for the complainants in the action against the minister that the minister failed to give them the opportunity to respond to a secret anthropological report on Aboriginal women's issues that have been mentioned; that Professor Saunders refused to meet with two Aboriginal women who denied claims being made by other women about the spirituality of Hindmarsh Island; that Mr Tickner failed to appoint a mediator to resolve the row despite a formal request from the developers' lawyers; and that Aboriginal women refused to meet with an anthropologist engaged by the developers and refused to provide details of their claims against the bridge. These are most serious concerns. They are before the Federal Court, and I will not comment further other than to place them on record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns were raised at the last minute after people had committed their funding. Those people have been caught short and, as a result, they have suffered a most severe disability in the form of going into receivership. Men and women of Australia need to know that there is certainty when they undertake commercial enterprises. That, I can tell Senator Schacht, is not a question of states rights; it is a question of basic citizens rights which one would expect from the government of the day. We do not expect to go through all the usual processes, have them approved, be halfway through construction, and then be stopped by a 30-day order without any recourse whatsoever. The process which has been engaged in is highly suspect; so much so that it has to be taken to the Federal Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that John McHughes, who is a long time Goolwa resident and a Ngarrindjeri descendant, said that he had moved into the area in 1946 and he had never heard anything about any areas of Aboriginal significance in the vicinity of the proposed bridge. This highlights the uncertainty of the situation. Despite that, the minister went ahead and acted. The consequences of his actions were draconian. One could not get an injunction in a court without having substantial reasons for the injunction. The reason why courts grant injunctions sparingly is that injunctions have the effect of tying up people and money and therefore possibly causing a great deal of financial loss which can be devastating. Just as individuals in their daily lives do not want to be thwarted in their endeavours&mdash;especially when they have had approval to proceed&mdash;people in the commercial sector do not want to face a similar uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter mentioned the question of property speculation. Any commercial endeavour has an aspect of speculation about it. We live in a free enterprise society. If one of our neighbours down the street has a garage sale, there is an element of speculation about that; there is an endeavour to sell something and get money in return. Men and women in Australia frequently buy houses which have been the subject of development. Daily, we find builders and developers opening up areas for new residences. That is an endeavour which is in the best interests of this country. Should we halt all commercial speculation tomorrow? Should we halt all development tomorrow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we do not have development of that sort, we will not be able to offer young couples setting out to buy a house any hope at all. This is all about offering some sort of certainty to people when they embark on these sorts of ventures. The law does not disregard individuals who have concerns or cultural groups in that regard; that is why we have environmental impact statements, town planning proposals and even anthropological studies, which were carried out. But where was the objection in the 1980s? We have had it only in the last year. It was only when ATSIC had been advised that some sort of objection on cultural grounds could succeed that we had these aspects or concerns being raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us assume that these concerns are genuine. The fact still remains that they were not raised earlier, and that is the aspect of most concern. There is a principle of equity that, if people sit on their rights, they lose them. If people's rights are being infringed and those people take no action in relation to that, one can only assume that they are  acquiescing or waiving their rights or any exercise on their part to take action to enforce those rights. That is an aspect which is of crucial importance here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to Western Australia, we view this with great concern because it is federal interference with the due process of something which is squarely within the jurisdiction of the states. It is not a question of asserting states rights; it is a question of making the federation work. The federal government is very keen on looking at a republic. If the government approaches this issue with the attitude of `to hell with states rights', then it will never reach any form of consensus as to what form this country will take in the next century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is a very large country and over that huge geographical area there are different interests and requirements for its various citizens. If the federal government, which sits here isolated in Canberra, does not take that into account, it can forget any question of reaching consensus as to where this country will be going in the next century. If its ministers are to exercise such comprehensive powers without due regard to the process of law, then it will fragment society. It will cause division in society. This approach will not lead to the consensus which we would all hope for because the federal executive arm of government in this country has shown over recent years a contempt not only for the proper process of parliament but also for the regional aspects concerning the people of Australia. That is what the government is faced with here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that this is a question so much of states rights; it is a question of state responsibilities. These are areas where the state governments have responsibilities to govern for the people of the states, and this is an area where a federal minister has intruded without any basis for such intrusion. I believe that the Hindmarsh Island bridge and the Broome crocodile farm in Western Australia, albeit quite discrete, quite separate, stand for a principle which is of universal application in this country: an arbitrary executive decision by a minister riding roughshod over the due process of law. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht questioned Senator Teague's motives for moving his motion. Senator Schacht refuses to understand that even though the flawed legislation, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait (Islander Heritage Protection) Act, gives the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) the power to do what he has done, it also clearly vests in this parliament the power to do what Senator Teague is seeking to do today. So, as representatives of the states&mdash;and Senator Teague is a representative of South Australia&mdash;we are exercising a power to disallow. It would seem from the indications of my colleagues from the Australian Democrats and the Greens that the parliament, in its wisdom, will decide not to disallow the declaration in relation to Hindmarsh Island. However, Senator Teague has the right to do what he has done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If I may seek to enter Senator Teague's mind, I believe that he and I would share the same view about Australia and how one protects individual rights and freedoms in Australia&mdash;that one of the worst ways of seeking to protect individual rights and freedoms is to have decisions about people's lives made some 3,000 miles away in Canberra by ministers who have no political link with a particular area. It will not matter what Minister Tickner does to the people of South Australia or the people of Goolwa because his political life will never be affected by those decisions.

I know it is very hard for the minister to comprehend these ideas&mdash;it is very hard for him to comprehend anything because his mouth is open all the time; it is very hard for his brain to get into gear. Premier Lynn Arnold and Premier Dean Brown had their political fortunes affected by these decisions. Michael Armitage and all of the politicians in South Australia have a political stake. Senator Schacht would tell the Senate that the South Australian community could not come to an agreement; that there was no unanimity; that no-one cheered when Lynn Arnold gave the contract; that no-one said, `This is fantastic. We have unanimous support for the building of this bridge.' I do not think one could obtain unanimous support for the building of a bridge anywhere in the world. I do not think anyone could say, `This is a great thing&mdash;every single person in this community wants this bridge.' There is probably a ferry operator somewhere who would not want a bridge. That would apply even to the Friendship bridge that we built in Laos.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Teague and I probably do come from slightly different strands of Liberal thinking but we would very much share the view that one needs to protect individual rights within our democracy and within our federation. We share one thing very solidly, as all Liberals do, and that is the belief that the best way of ensuring that individual rights and freedoms are protected within a democracy is to make sure that decisions that affect people's lives are made very close to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This great federation of Australia has been undermined by Senator Schacht's party and by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, over their 10 or 11 years in power. They do not like this federation. They have always argued that there should be one government and that should be in Canberra, and that there should be subservient regional governments and no state governments. It is part of their political philosophy. It is part of Senator Schacht's philosophy. He does not want state governments; he wants to abolish the states. He also wants to abolish the Senate. They would like to have a unitary government here in Canberra making decisions and some throwaway, hand-me-down type powers given to subservient regional governments which would be virtually totally reliant on Canberra for funding. </PARA>

They would not dare give people that amount of power; they would want to preserve that for themselves. They want a unitary system. They want one house of parliament, the House of Representatives, and, of course, no state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a crucial issue in this decision. What we are looking at here is not the building of a bridge and whether Mr McLachlan or Mr Brown liked the bridge; we are looking at how we run a country. How do we run Australia? In the case of the Broome crocodile farm and in the case of the Hindmarsh Island bridge, we have earnest, honest people seeking to go about developing this nation. They went through all the processes that Senator Ellison has so eloquently described&mdash;the environmental processes, the ethnographic surveys, the Aboriginal heritage processes and the local museums. Finally, in the case of Hindmarsh Island, they got approval, even with all of the surrounding political controversy&mdash;the Labor Party wanting to build the bridge and the Liberal Party opposing it. They get the thing under way and at the last minute the government from Canberra comes in and decides to stop the construction of the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what we are talking about. It is not states rights or anything else. It is simply: is that the right way to run a country? Will we have a sustainable nation? Will we have a sustainable federation if we have this extremely wasteful duplication of process and the uncertainty that would surround that process? If Senator Schacht earnestly believes that the federal government is the best government to make decisions about these land development matters, then the government should go to the Australian people and put to them a referendum question seeking their approval to hand over the power of land management to the federal government. If that were the case, it would become an efficient process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be very hard for people from South Australia, Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland to come here to get their approvals, but it would be a far more efficient process than what we have at the moment. At the moment, people who want to develop anything in Australia have to go through all of the local and state processes and then cross their fingers and hope against hope that the federal government does not intervene at the last moment. So we now have this enormous risk, which is increasing every single year because of the activities of this Labor government, that development processes at the local and state levels can be overridden at the last moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we want an efficiently run nation, if we want an efficient federation, we should have a land management process that is controlled by one level of government. We in the opposition would, of course, argue that it is most appropriate that that be done close to the ground, close to where the action is taking place, so that there are political imperatives acting upon that local level of state government and the local authorities to ensure that decisions are, indeed, in touch with the community. That would be our argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht and Mr Keating would prefer to see all of that abolished.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Broome crocodile farm which I have a close interest in, and now the Hindmarsh Island bridge, that has not happened. It is a system that will, in the long run, do much to undermine people's faith in Aboriginal heritage and culture and the processes we go about in resolving the conflicts that occur between development and the sensible protection of that. If we do not get this worked out it will undermine not only the certainty that developers have in the processes but also community support for the protection of Aboriginal heritage and culture. </PARA>

It is probably one of the better examples of the reconciliation that is occurring between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What seriously concerns me is that when we have these jurisdictional battles between state and federal government, the community's appreciation of these matters is being undermined. That is something that no-one in this place would like to see happen. There have been two very bad examples in my time in parliament&mdash;the Broome crocodile farm and the Hindmarsh Island declaration&mdash;where the whole process has been a disgrace. That needs to be changed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Saunders said in her report that there are a number of issues in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act that require review and possibly amendment. She looked particularly at the giving of evidence and the secrecy provisions. They are not matters on which I have focused. However, in the light of the Broome crocodile farm example, I have focused some of my attention on the matter of compensation payable when these declarations apply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in the United States a couple of months ago there was a debate raging in the Congress about a similar issue. The US federal government had issued a wetlands protection order on some land in Louisiana. The issues involved were similar to those that we are facing. In the US case, the federal government had issued an order to protect the heritage and environmental values of the wetlands while in our case the federal government is issuing a heritage protection order to preserve indigenous culture and heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that is going through the Congress&mdash;I am not sure whether it has been successful&mdash;is designed to ensure that in those cases where the federal government intervenes and effectively takes away people's property rights, those people have a legislated right to proper compensation. The compensation provisions in the Australian heritage protection act provide no fundamental right to compensation. There are clauses that consider the issue of compensation but effectively the compensation is left to the discretion of the minister. If the person appealing for compensation is not satisfied, he or she has the right to go to the Federal Court. What concerns me is that in virtually all other areas of the acquisition of land and property by government there are strict provisions for the calculation of that compensation. In the case of the acquisition of freehold title, compensation is determined very much by the value of the land. There is an enormous amount of common law covering these acquisition issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have drafted a private senator's bill to address these issues, but it may need to incorporate some of the matters that Professor Saunders has raised. It is designed to ensure that, as compensation arises in matters such as the Broome crocodile farm and Hindmarsh Island, there are quite clear guidelines, prepared by senior and independent valuers and incorporated in regulations. That way, people who have these sorts of orders put on their land and have the value of their land diminished&mdash;in fact, have many of their property rights compulsorily acquired&mdash;should have no doubt whatsoever as to the guidelines relating to that compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Broome crocodile farm, where Mr Douglas can do nothing with his land for something like 25 years, effectively, in any reasonable man's consideration, we would have to say that that equates to a resumption of the freehold or a resumption of the leasehold of that land. If one is not allowed to do anything on the land for 25 years, effectively the value of the land is nil or negligible and, in those circumstances, the Commonwealth would certainly have to be required to pay the full value of the land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow that, once I have gone through the normal party processes, I will be bringing forward a private senators bill to seek to amend this bill. Certainly Professor Cheryl Saunders has raised some other potential amendments, and I hope that the Senate will constructively consider what I think are amendments that could improve this act, which is certainly causing concern in a range of areas right across Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I am a South Australian senator and I support this South Australian project, the development and building of a bridge across the River Murray to Hindmarsh Island. That is why, on behalf of the opposition, I have moved a motion for the disallowance of the declaration of the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, that that bridge be banned for 25 years. He has banned it without an explanation, and we are holding him and the government to account. The declaration is without foundation. It should not stand. The bridge should be built.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The South Australian government, a liberal government elected last December, supports the building of the bridge and wishes to see this declaration by the federal minister disallowed. The former Labor government&mdash;that is, the government in power before last December&mdash;entered into a full contract to build the bridge. The Labor government in South Australia wanted the bridge built; its successor, the current Liberal government, wants the bridge built. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties in this parliament in Canberra want the bridge built. It happens that my colleagues the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Downer, the shadow minister for the environment, Mr McLachlan, and the shadow minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mrs Gallus, are all South Australians, as I am. We all want this declaration by Minister Tickner disallowed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six senators have contributed to this debate. I listened carefully to all of the speeches, except for five minutes at the beginning of Senator Chamarette's contribution which I missed. I am disappointed by the contribution made by the Greens, the Australian Democrats and the Labor government. Not one of those senators has gone to the nub of the explanation that was proffered in a very flimsy way by a person I do respect, Professor Saunders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not criticise Professor Saunders; I criticise the minister who appointed her with such haste and with a deadline of weeks&mdash;she had three and a half weeks to report on a complex matter&mdash;and I do not believe Professor Saunders's report is in any way convincing. I can respect a person and still be unconvinced by the argument or conclusion that that person might put to me. I will be honest enough to say that I am not convinced by the bottom line on this matter of this highly respectable academic, this constitutional lawyer, Professor Cheryl Saunders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I spent a great deal of my original speech yesterday when introducing this matter getting to the nub of Professor Saunders's reasons for recommending that the bridge be not built. I included page 42 of her report in full. I do not wish to go over it at any great length, but not one of the senators who spoke against my motion referred to this crucial element. The only references that were made by Senator Coulter or Senator Chamarette to Aboriginal sites of significance related to burial areas, bones and human remains, but this was not sufficient to move the minister to make this declaration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are about 1,000 sites in the lower Murray area, including all of Goolwa and most areas of the Hindmarsh Island, in which there are burial sites and human remains. There are also about 1,000 middens spread out over the area. In his briefings to Aboriginal people last December and again in April the minister, Mr Tickner, said, `That is not a convincing argument for me to intervene and to make a declaration that the bridge be not built; you must come back with wider, more convincing arguments.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will spell this out more explicitly with material that I did not use yesterday. In December 1993 a delegation of the Lower Murray Aboriginal Heritage Committee, led by Douglas Milerar and George Trevorrow, saw Minister Tickner here in Canberra. They spoke about Aboriginal sites, burial grounds and middens. They did not refer at all last December to the issue that moved Professor Saunders; the issue that Minister Tickner has referred to as being the reason for his declaration, and that is the women's issues&mdash;what is in the secret envelopes that he cannot read. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened between December and when the women's issue arose in June this year? I will tell the Senate what happened. The asking of Mr Tickner to use special Commonwealth laws to delay or stop the bridge because it threatened sites of archaeological significance was not sufficient. The legislation had not been used to protect the site `primarily of archaeological significance'. ATSIC said that Mr Tickner would be greatly influenced by evidence of the cultural significance of the sites affected by the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People went away and tried to do some homework again on this. Senator Coulter is right when he said that a coalition developed between those with Aboriginal concerns and those with environmental concerns. I acknowledge that. In fact, the trade unions were involved as well and they were crucially important in the articulation and the publication of newsletters and so on on behalf of that coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand their position. They were a minority. They have an extreme environmentalist concern that says, `Hey, the former Labor government in South Australia wanted the bridge built; the current newly elected Liberal government wants the bridge built. How can we stop this? What sort of rearguard action can we take to stop the bridge?' They try the environmental argument. The environmental argument does not wash. It does not actually affect the outcome. Then, along with the advice that the Aboriginal committee gained in December and more subsequently in April from ATSIC, they said, `Hey, we have got to play the Aboriginal card. We have to find something of cultural significance in the lower Murray that will be able to be used by Minister Tickner to gain the real prize which is the environmentalist arguments in that coalition.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I used the word `contrived' yesterday. I do not use the word `contrived' of Professor Saunders or of Mrs Kartinyeri, the spokesman of the Ngarrindjeri women&mdash;and I still do not know whether there are five, 15, or only one or two Ngarrindjeri women. No-one has answered that question in this debate. I do not question Mrs Kartinyeri's evidence. I just say that she was the spokesperson for these Aboriginal women from April, May, or June&mdash;the critical period this year&mdash;when a new argument had to be found. She lives on Yorke Peninsula. There are no Ngarrindjeri women who live in the lower Murray any more. She had to develop a culturally significant argument that would allow Minister Tickner some new card&mdash;environmental, Aboriginal, left-wing Labor, political or whatever the motivation, or whatever things were guiding the minister's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kartinyeri, as I said yesterday, at that point said, `I, personally, did not know the areas of significance in the lower River Murray.' She said that in a letter to Mr Tickner. That is why I used the word `contrived'. Words were put in her mouth about the women's issue: the lower Murray waters around islands, with bends and around the Murray mouth, being an analogy with a woman's reproductive system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can imagine how women last century and the century before in their dreaming and in their sense of stewardship of sites in the whole of this region could have a spiritually important sense of stewardship for the lower Murray in these terms. But Mrs Kartinyeri did not know what were the sites of significance. She `recently' discovered them, in the context of the coalition that Senator Coulter has referred to&mdash;environmentalists, Aboriginal activists and trade unionists&mdash;as a minority against the wishes of the majority of residents of Goolwa and the lower Murray area, and against the wishes of the people living on Hindmarsh Island, to be a part of this rearguard action to try to stop the bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the argument was eventually put to Professor Saunders, no-one was able to articulate the spiritual beliefs of the women&mdash;and we are not told how many there are. I will concede, with Senator Schacht, that maybe there is only one. If there is a spiritual belief of one Australian, a Ngarrindjeri woman, I want to respect that person's beliefs; I fully respect the spiritual beliefs of every Australian. But we must ask questions as to the relationship of those spiritual beliefs to any assertions as to what should happen in public policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins is in the chamber. I bring to his attention a debate that occurred in cabinet about a mining development in the Northern Territory in which Senator Collins disagreed with former Prime Minister Bob Hawke with regard to the credibility of certain Aboriginal claims that were being used by the then Prime Minister as a reason for not going ahead with the development in the Northern Territory. The then Prime Minister was in a minority in that discussion, and yet, because he was Prime Minister, he won the day. That was one of the telling indicators that Mr Hawke was on the skids as Prime Minister: he did not have credibility in his argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the same assessment with regard to Mr Tickner's response to the Saunders report on this issue. There was such a bias, such a predisposition, on the minister's part, whether for environmental reasons, whether for left-wing Labor political reasons, whether out of competition with the Democrats and the Greens for a minority vote&mdash;I do not know what the reasons were. To then gain a contrived argument about women's issues, an Aboriginal sacred site is used to stop a development that will cause $175 million worth of loss to South Australia, and to this region in particular, and 1,200 new jobs to be lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those figures were acknowledged by Senator Chamarette and by Senator Coulter. They said, `We understand those figures, but the sacred site is more important.' I think Senator Coulter would say that the birds are more important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I get to the nub of the issue again: it is not about archaeological sites; it is not about burial grounds; it is not about middens; it is about women's issues. It is what is in the secret envelopes that cannot be read by a man. That is what public policy is being built upon. The people of my state reject it. They laugh at it. They are not convinced.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The link between the spiritual beliefs&mdash;and I respect the spiritual beliefs&mdash;and the building of a bridge is put in these terms by Dr Fergie. She said to Professor Saunders&mdash;I am referring to page 42 of the Saunders report&mdash;that none of the women could articulate what the connection was between their spiritual beliefs and the bridge. This is the witness on their behalf saying it&mdash;an anthropologist appointed by the Aboriginal legal rights movement. Then she said, `I surmise, I think, that the issue is that the bridge will go above the water'&mdash;the word `above' is underlined&mdash;`and not through the water. Because it goes above the water, it is not mediated by water. Consequently, it would make the system sterile.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supposed to be rational. Is anybody convinced by that? Let them put up their hand. Let them indicate now that they are convinced by this logic.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only say to Democrat senators, Green senators and Labor senators: when the little boy stands up in a little while and says, `The king has no clothes on', will they be among the group that says, `We knew the king did not have any clothes on but, out of political correctness, we had to say that he had on the finest clothes in the land'?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to honourable senators that there is no explanation. In my submission to Professor Saunders on 11 June, in the second major point I made to her, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . as a consequence of Ministerial intervention under this Act, the Minister must publish a clear explanation of the specific heritage matters that are in need of protection. This explanation should be given both in terms of the reasons for the declaration under section 9 being made (that is, the nature of the appeals or the alleged heritage matters to be protected) and then, later, in terms of the confirmed findings of any inquiries made as a result of the Minister's intervention. In particular, I respect the fact that some aboriginal heritage matters are secret to the specific guardians of that heritage.</PARA>
<PARA>After all, for six years I was a member of the council of the Institute of Aboriginal Studies and did all I could in those six years to further the Aboriginal heritage of this country. My submission continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, it would be a failure of Ministerial accountability if such secrecy denied an appropriate and substantial explanation by the Minister of the matters involved. Appropriate, intelligible summaries (which avoid the specific secret words) would still need to be given by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>That was my submission to Professor Saunders. Professor Saunders has not given that intelligible explanation and Minister Tickner has not given that intelligible explanation. I call upon all senators to reject the intervention because it is not good enough for ministers to act without reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer very briefly to some of the other matters raised in this debate. Senator Chamarette did not give an explanation of the nub of this issue; she only referred to the sacred burial sites. She is out of date. She is talking about conversations she had when she visited earlier this year, before the ATSIC advice to the minister that that was insufficient for the minister to act. She did not refer to the women's issues at all. She quoted the environmentalists, particularly Mr Shearman, as welcoming the ban because she is really wanting an environmental and Aboriginal outcome, as do Senator Coulter and the Democrats. There is a competition between these two minority parties to get the vote of the environmentalists and the Aboriginal communities which they believe can be won by one or other minority party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter, making an extravagant analogy, talked about reverence. I say to Senator Coulter that there is no monopoly on reverence. I have a great sense of the beauty and a reverence for the experience when I go to that part of God's creation which I see in the Coorong National Park in the lower Murray region. I agree with him about having reverence. But to make extravagant analogies about money changers in the cathedral or snack bars between the graves, is, of course, just rhetoric relating to his particular assessment and his opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I accept that Senator Coulter is opposed to development. He has said, in an exaggerated way, that this development will be a mini-Gold Coast.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point to Senator Coulter that the mayor and the council of Goolwa, who have responsibility for Hindmarsh Island, fully support the bridge being built. They have written in those terms to every senator. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already addressed most of the matters raised by Senator Schacht. He spoke about the moving feasts of various political opinions about this bridge in recent months. I can only affirm my earlier response: the former Labor government authorised the bridge. A contract was let and a start was made on building the bridge two months before the state election last year. It was stopped by the rearguard action of demonstrators. Subsequently it was laid over until after the election, and it was again started&mdash;this time by the Liberal state government&mdash;in May of this year; and then it was stopped by Minister Tickner's preliminary one-month ban, which was then confirmed as a 25-year ban. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not moved by Senator Schacht's references to various opinions that people have held in the past.

I welcome all that they have said and I thank them for their support. I particularly draw attention to Senator Ellison's legal references to the important issue of process and how it must be conceded in the Senate that we are to act upon the basis of law; that we are to give certainty to any developer on the basis that a legally approved project means what it says; and that there ought not to be eleventh hour stoppages to developments that Australian citizens are going about in the normal course of their lives on the basis of legal approvals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech yesterday I referred in detail to the approvals that have been given for this bridge, which has now been stopped only because of the federal minister's intervention. Let me make it quite clear to the Senate: if this motion that I have moved is now passed by a majority of senators, all barriers to the building of the bridge will have been removed and the bridge will be built. I hope that 39 senators will support the disallowance. I am confident of 36. I hope that all senators have listened carefully to the debate, and that in the division which is to occur in a few minutes time we will see the 36 Liberal and National senators supported by at least three other senators in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was in full flight at about 7.20 on Monday night speaking on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) before being interrupted by the Acting Deputy President who was in the chair at the time. Now I have to get back the same sort of enthusiasm that I had&mdash;not enthusiasm for the issue but for attacking the government on the disastrous way it has hoodwinked the Australian public about the home child-care allowance. At the last election, Mr Keating said that the person at home caring for a child would get $30.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who listened to that election speech would have thought `tremendous'. Little did they know that the dependent spouse rebate would be taken out of the paid working partner's contribution, with about $2.60 added to make up the $30&mdash;a pea and thimble trick. Many of the carers at home, who are mainly women, were hoodwinked into thinking they were going to get $30. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the government tried to implement that promise. It suddenly found that there were some complications when it took the money out of the tax system and put it into the Department of Social Security. When I was last speaking on this bill&mdash;before I was interrupted because we ran out of time&mdash;I was outlining some of the problems associated with that, and I will continue with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem is that a significant number of families with dependent spouses and dependent children who are currently eligible for the dependent spouse rebate will not be eligible to transfer to the home child-care allowance. They will not be eligible for the home child-care allowance primarily because the transfer of this payment from the taxation system to the social security system involves consequent differences between the systems&mdash;differences in residency requirements, age requirements, prescribed student exclusion and spouse and income definitions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was interrupted on Monday night, I was talking about young academics on study leave for six to 12 months who would not be eligible for the dependent spouse rebate or the home child-care allowance because they were away. They would have been eligible for the dependent spouse rebate under the old system before Mr Keating's election promise. Those young people, while trying to improve their knowledge and skills and contribute to the education of other young Australians, were going to be penalised. Those are the sorts of people we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We argued this point when another bill was debated in relation to this issue. Fortunately, the government has had belatedly and grudgingly to amend the legislation to deal with this issue. We were actually right. Mr Keating said, `No family will be worse off.' That is similar to the promise of the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, who said `No child will live in poverty.' Here was the next Prime Minister giving us another promise&mdash;that no family would be worse off. We identified a large number of families that would be worse off, and the minister at the table at the time&mdash;I think it was Senator Crowley&mdash;pooh-poohed the idea and said that it was all wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government has grudgingly come to the party and brought in some amendments. Families which were ineligible for the home child-care allowance under different social security definitions were not even able to claim the dependent spouse rebate at the with-child dependent spouse rate under the new government amendments. They will receive the dependent spouse rebate only at the lower rate for dependent spouses without children. The way the government goes about it is pretty measly. People claiming a rebate cannot go back to the old system; they can get the without-child dependent spouse rebate. So they are still penalised under the government amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The without-child dependent spouse rebate is paid at the lower rate of $1,188, while the with-child rebate is paid at $1,425. In effect, if a family is left claiming the dependent spouse rebate on the without-child rate, it will be $237 worse off, and it will be $372 worse off than families with dependent spouses and children who are receiving the home child-care allowance. Mr Keating's promise was that no family would be worse off. As my colleague Senator Watson foreshadowed, I will move an amendment in the committee stage of this debate to ensure that those families which currently receive the with-child dependent spouse rebate and which are not eligible for the HCCA, because of the stricter eligibility test, will continue to receive the with-child DSR. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The home child-care allowance has been a disaster from beginning to end. I will give honourable senators an example. I was talking on the phone last night to somebody who had applied for the home child-care allowance. The application form was sent in, but a signature was missing on one page. Back came a new form, not the old form so that the person concerned could correct it and sign it. If that person makes an error on that new form, I presume it will go to the Department of Social Security and come back again. It is a whole lot of nonsense. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, this was Mr Keating's key election policy commitment. At the launch at his last election campaign he said, `This allowance is more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it will replace.' But that was a deliberate deception. The scheme was flawed in its original drafting and implemented with incompetence, trickery and bungling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of the home child-care allowance has involved an election promise that was a deliberate hoax and deception. The original bill caused thousands of families which qualified for the dependent spouse rebate not to be eligible for the HCCA because of different DSS income and eligibility criteria. There was a belated and begrudging government amendment to provide a safety net for those currently eligible for DSR but not eligible for HCCA, but only at the without child rate of DSR&mdash;a totally unacceptable and inequitable proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history has involved a situation whereby thousands of families which do qualify for HCCA will be worse off than when receiving the DSR because of different and stricter DSS definitions of income. And it has involved a bungled legislative program, resulting in the government incompetently failing to pass the complementary tax legislation which abolishes the dependent spouse rebate in time for the start-up of the HCCA&mdash;a bungle which has placed around 420,000 families in danger of receiving unexpected tax bills. In addition, there is the overriding inequity of means testing the home child-care allowance but not means testing the child-care rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By paying HCCA directly to the carer a positive signal is being sent to the community about recognition of the real value to our society of the task of raising children. I have acknowledged that before when I have spoken on this issue in this place. But it can be argued that this message is not evident in a system which gives a tax deductible spouse rebate to the parent who is not at home raising the children. The message is half-hearted in that it offers $30 a week, means tested, to parents who choose to raise their children at home, but offers up to $60 a week to parents who go out to work and put their children in a child-care centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the federal government has been forced to admit that its new home child-care allowance has not lived up to Mr Keating's promise that it would be more generous than the dependent spouse rebate it replaces. The very fact that the government has indicated that it will move an amendment to provide a safety net confirms what the coalition said at the outset&mdash;that thousands of families will be worse off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, this has been an absolute disaster from beginning to end. It was a promise hatched up, I suppose, with Ms Anne Summers&mdash;who was brought out at great cost to the Australian public to help Mr Keating win the women's vote&mdash;and dreamed up somewhere without any consultation on implementation. We have seen that it has not been easy to implement. It will mean that some families are worse off and, despite our best efforts, some families will still not get the same amount they were getting under the DSR. This has been an absolute hoodwinking of the Australian public and the government will be constantly reminded of it by this side of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) is the third of probably five omnibus taxation bills which, up until this week, the parliament was expecting to consider this year. I doubt whether we will get around to them now. The bill contains 158 sections amending the income and sales tax laws. It creates sections with such interesting new names as 160CX5A, which sounds more like a radio station than a section of a tax act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax act appears to be growing more quickly than the Assistant Treasurer, George Gear, and his new income tax simplification group can reduce and simplify it. It has 20 chapters dealing with a wide range of tax matters, small and large. The largest revenue measure is the introduction of the reportable payments system, first foreshadowed in September 1992 and expected to raise upwards of $100 million a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the bill deals with various concessions and rebates, such as incentives for regional headquarters of multi-national corporations, arrangements governing the dependent spouse rebate and home child-care allowance, provisional tax, tax deductibility of cultural bequests, and sales tax exemptions for exported re-manufactured goods. The Australian Democrats will be supporting most of the bill, although we will be proposing three sets of amendments and supporting one of the opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before moving to the areas of contention, I want briefly to note three areas of the bill. Firstly, this bill sets up the prescribed payment system for taxation, and this initiative was first foreshadowed in the Treasurer's tax statement back in September 1992. It is probably worth recalling a little bit of the politics of the time because that was when the government was under pressure to fund its unfunded tax cuts and it explored a range of tax options after the 1992 budget. Then, miraculously, Tax Commissioner Trevor Boucher sent a letter to Treasurer Dawkins proudly claiming that he could collect hundreds of millions of dollars of extra tax revenue with a few new compliance measures. I think that solved the government's immediate dilemma. It was about to go to a 1993 federal election with tax funds it claimed were now funded, only to discover in the 1993 budget that they were not and forcing up a range of indirect taxes instead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two years later the key compliance measure from the 1992 tax statement has finally arrived. I note that Mr Boucher's successor, Mr Carmody, has revised down substantially the amount he thinks he can collect from the prescribed payment system to just $100 million. The Democrats will give this measure our support and we will watch with interest to see the revenue that the government ends up collecting from this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second item I wish to mention is the concessions for the establishment of regional headquarters in Australia. We do not object to it in principle, but we are not entirely convinced about the way we are going about it. I note that a wide range of firms have reported that the concessions are not competitive enough when compared with Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong. But, given our much higher standard of living and provision of government services, I would hate to see Australia engaged in a tax bidding war against developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned about the priorities which the government shows in this bill in respect of providing millions of dollars of concessions to multinational companies to come to Australia. I am not concerned about their coming; I am concerned about the government's priorities in doing that on the one hand at the same time as denying urgently needed tax relief to Australian small business. Again, this is an initiative that we will be watching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third item I wish to mention is the sales tax exemption on re-manufactured goods. The Democrats, after a lot of consultation with industry, have resolved to support the opposition amendment to extend the sales tax exemption from re-manufactured goods used by business and intended for export to include non-taxable organisations. This was the case until 1992. Given that re-manufacturing is a labour intensive area with the potential to reduce our propensity to import capital goods, that manufacturing encourages the recycling and the extension of the life of equipment and that non-taxable organisations deserve to be treated no less favourably than taxable ones, we have resolved to support the opposition amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later in this debate my colleague Senator Lees will outline our position on the provisions relating to the dependent spouse rebate and Senator Coulter will move amendments to the cultural bequests section. But I want to concentrate on the provisional tax uplift factor. Too often, and most recently in the employment white paper and the budget, the government has forgotten that small business is the engine room of job creation. If Australia is ever to reduce unemployment to five per cent or lower, this has to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax system, the finance system and the regulatory system need to be adjusted to broaden the growth horizons of small business rather than to hinder them, as they often do at present. A few weeks ago, Alexander Downer released <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Things That Matter</EMPHASIS>. In that document he committed the opposition to promotion of small business, to greater assistance for families and to genuine but balanced environmental policies. He committed the opposition to building up the status of parliament and to more effective scrutiny of legislation in the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill gives the opposition an opportunity to do a lot of that. I want to know what the opposition thinks about the anti-small business provisions contained in the provisional tax section of this bill. This bill seeks to put into practice the budget announcement that the provisional tax uplift factor will be set at eight per cent for 1994-95. That means that provisional taxpayers, including most small business people, farmers and self-funded retirees, will automatically have their taxable income from 1993-94 inflated by eight per cent to become their provisional taxable income for 1994-95.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is nearly four times the inflation rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is to force many small businesses to pay more tax than they should have to. I do not object to people having to pay tax, but I think we have to do it fairly. Based on government estimates, setting the uplift factor at eight per cent rather than, say, five per cent, increases the tax take in 1994-95 by about $250 million. This is the money which the government largely concedes it will have to refund in 1995-96. So by setting the provisional tax uplift factor too high the government is effectively borrowing money&mdash;money out of the pockets of cash-strapped small business. It is a clever trick if people think they can get away with it. Up until this year the loan was interest free. Now a small interest rate will be paid until it is refunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government tells us that small businesses can apply to have their provisional tax uplift factor reduced, but this requires a detailed assessment of income projections, with penalties if the projection is outside the approved 15 per cent tolerance. For most people, such a detailed income projection costs money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the National Tax Agents Association, Ray Regan, gave evidence to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on Monday, 3 October 1994, that to have such an application professionally prepared would cost between $60 and $600. He said that it takes time, it takes effort and it adds to the compliance costs. Mr Regan estimated that half or about 800,000 provisional taxpayers would have income which would rise by less than eight per cent, and should be encouraged to apply for a variation. About 170,000 taxpayers had to apply for a variation last year. Based on Mr Regan's estimate of the cost of such applications, that represents a compliance cost last year of between $10 million and $100 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than that, I think the government has failed to establish any defensible rationale for the eight per cent figure. The explanatory memorandum says that the uplift factor reflects the effects of inflation and other relevant factors. Inflation in 1994-95 is estimated to be a bit over two per cent. So what are the other relevant factors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Treasury officials at the Senate committee hearing failed to identify these factors, but we can look at other relevant factors. On term of shares the all ordinaries index rose just 5.08 per cent in the year until August. Retail trade increased by just 5.72 per cent in the year to June. Ninety day bill interest rates rose from about 4.75 per cent to about 5.5 per cent in 1993-94. The property market was mixed, with metropolitan residential markets improving but commercial and rental properties remaining fairly flat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that leave us with? The relevant factors all seem to suggest that eight per cent is just too high. In fact, the relevant factors have been suggesting that for four years. In the five years to 1994-95 the uplift factor has exceeded the inflation rates by an average of 6.3 per cent. This is more than twice the gap between the uplift factor and the inflation rate over the previous five years from 1985-86 to 1989-90. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past five years, provisional tax receipts have been very flat and have risen by less than the inflation rate. In the last three years for which tax statistics are available, the average income of provisional taxpayers fell by an average of 0.4 per cent, against an uplift factor of 10 per cent. The Democrats, in our budget submission to the government, called for a reduction of this uplift factor. This followed discussion with members of the Small Business Coalition and was part of our response to the key issues they raised. We were disappointed that the white paper on employment failed to address the impact of provisional tax on small business cash flows, compliance costs and employment generation ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition tells me that it is not going to support our amendment. It has trotted out some terrific justifications, the first one being that it is going to plunder the public revenue. Minimal cost is not plundering the public revenue. If Senator Panizza had been at the Senate committee hearing, he would have heard Treasury officials say that over two years it costs virtually nothing. The second little excuse we heard from the opposition was, `Small business is already engaged in working all this out and does not want to have to change. Let us wait until next year.' But those opposite should ask small businesses whether they would like some cash back now. They will say that they do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon I seek to address the report from the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waste disposal</EMPHASIS>, which was tabled last month. I had the pleasure of serving on that committee. Let me say, firstly, what a pleasure it was being involved with my colleagues from all sides of politics. Secondly, this report once again highlights the benefits of Senate committees with members from all parties investigating matters and coming down with reports&mdash;once again, in this situation, with a unanimous report. Thirdly, it is unfortunate that these types of reports do not get the degree of media publicity that they deserve. The people of Australia do not often see this side of the parliament in operation; nor do they see the results achieved by these committees, where senators from the Labor Party, the Democrats, the National Party and the Liberal Party cooperate to achieve a report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To commence my remarks about the report, let me thank Robert King, Cheryl Scarlett and other members of the committee secretariat for their efforts. The background to this report is that on 17 November 1993 the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts received a reference on existing and developmental waste disposal facilities and methods, including the use of incineration as a means of disposal of waste and energy recovery, the application of alternative technologies to the disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes, the potential for commercial development, and the export opportunities of methods of waste disposal and waste disposal technologies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inquiry was required to take particular account of the findings and recommendations contained in two reports: the Independent Panel on Intractable Waste report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A cleaner Australia</EMPHASIS> and the Scheduled Wastes Working Group report to the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council which was dated 27 May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all, the committee received 89 submissions. The committee has presented a report of some 280 pages. I suggest that it is in fact a report to all Australians, and a report that is worthy of consideration. As such, I recommend it to all Australians, because waste disposal is a problem that needs to be addressed not only by industry and by government but by all Australians. Waste disposal is a community problem. It is not only an industry problem, it is also a domestic household problem&mdash;and, of course, a problem that local councils and local shires around Australia need to deal with, as it is usually their task to deal with waste disposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was estimated by one witness that 14 million tonnes of waste is generated in our country each year. That is a lot of waste. Unfortunately, a mere 10 per cent of this is actually recycled, so well in excess of 10 million tonnes of waste is categorised as waste with no further use. Approximately 90 per cent of our waste goes into landfill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some years ago, as part of a political exchange program, I had the privilege of examining the landfill waste disposal program in Germany. Vacant land is at premium prices in Europe. In Australia we have been cushioned to a certain extent because of our vast tracts of vacant land. However, it is still a problem that we need to consider as a nation before it is too late. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem with landfill is not only the scarcity of vacant land but the fact that the substances from the landfill eventually do leach into our waterways and our underground water supplies. It has been estimated by the Environment Protection Agency that 30 to 50 per cent of the materials going into landfill could be used in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the problems of waste disposal, the committee needed to define what waste actually is. I will read from page 2 of the report, paragraph 1.7, where two people who gave evidence to the committee came up with their definitions of waste. Professor Mainwaring said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . things are waste in the absence of an economic method of recovery and recycling.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Cole of the Environment Management Industry Association of Australia defined waste in these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . something that has no economic utility and has to be disposed, or stored, or whatever, but has no utility to society.</PARA>
<PARA>The best method of dealing with waste is minimising it in the first place. That is where all Australians can make their own contribution to the welfare of their country. For example, packaging represents about 33 per cent of household waste by weight, and considerably more by volume, according to the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories. If there can be a reuse of packaging, or less demand for it, we will be making some progress in dealing with our waste disposal problem. Every Australian can assist in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Australians, we individually consume approximately 70 kilograms of plastic each year. Plastic is an important and very convenient product in our day-to-day lives. However, I am sure that all of us could do something to decrease the consumption of plastic and thus relieve some of the problems our country faces. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from dealing with domestic waste, industrial waste was considered in great detail. A lot of the report is technical and deals with incineration and things of that nature, but I believe that the points I have made thus far are designed to encourage our fellow citizens actively and conscientiously to consider in their daily activities a course of action which will minimise the creation of waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, the disposal of waste is not environmentally sustainable. It also raises the issue of a future resource crisis if materials continue to be disposed of. Simply put, waste in the right quantity and used in the right way becomes a reusable or a recyclable material. As the committee stated, it unanimously supported the principles of waste minimisation and reuse as priorities, and the recycling of waste into other materials in preference to final disposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In commenting on this unanimous report, it is noteworthy that certain Commonwealth departments were not at all cooperative with the committee. Paragraph 11.76 on page 266 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another matter of concern to the Committee was the reluctance of some Commonwealth Departments to assist with this inquiry. The exception to this was the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency, who provided a comprehensive written submission, provided informative comments at the public hearing and supplementary material subsequent to the hearing. The Committee appreciates the efforts of the officers from CEPA.</PARA>
<PARA>The important part in this paragraph follows thus:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other relevant Commonwealth Departments did not provide information on very basic issues and did not answer adequately the fundamental questions asked at public hearings. The Committee reserves the right to follow up this matter at a later date.</PARA>
<PARA>The lack of cooperation is a sad reflection on these departments. If waste management is to be adequately addressed in this country, all government departments need to be on top of the subject, be conversant with the issues and be aware of the available information and statistics so as to be able to provide the necessary foundations on which to develop our policies in this area. An incapacity to answer fundamental questions and a refusal or incapacity to provide information on very basic issues reflects poorly on the relevant departments and their personnel. It is, more importantly, a great disservice to this country, which is seeking to grapple with the problem of waste disposal. I trust that the relevant ministers have read this report and given the necessary ministerial directives to ensure that their departments become more cooperative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If key departments do not possess the important data, let alone the will, to be actively involved in this issue, then waste disposal as an area of government policy will clearly be neglected to the detriment of this country. It is noteworthy that that was the unanimous finding of the committee. It was not a partisan political point that was sought to be made by the opposition or Democrats but something that was agreed to by the whole committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the few moments that I have left I wish to deal with another environmental issue which is somehow related. It is the issue of the fishing industry's care of our seas and use of them as a convenient dumping ground. I believe that it is only a small group within the fishing industry that undertakes this type of activity but I wish to relate an experience to the Senate this afternoon. One week ago today it was my wedding anniversary and my wife and I decided to take the day off and go for a bushwalk in southern Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did allow myself that one day off. Given the substantial sacrifices that my spouse makes in allowing me to be here, I thought it only appropriate that I agree to her suggestion that we do that. It was an absolutely fantastic day. I just want to recount the walk. I might add that, when we stopped for lunch and I unpacked the lunch box I was carrying, I discovered why the pack was so heavy. Out came the bottle of wine, the bottle opener, the glasses, the works. I am sure that I would not have carried all that if I had known that it was in the pack at the commencement of the walk! But of course that was my spouse's prerogative and I had no complaints.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To come back to the point at issue, we walked in from Cockle Creek through Blowhole Valley to South Cape Bay. An hour into the walk we noticed the signs to indicate our entry to the south-west Tasmania World Heritage area. The plains and forests were absolutely superb. The air was fresh, clean and crisp and, thankfully, the rain held off. After two hours walk through this truly exhilarating landscape, we heard the sound of the Southern Ocean and the breakers on the shore. The sea air was superb. The craggy coastline was awe-inspiring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as we descended the rock face, my wife and I were horrified by the amount of rubbish on the beach&mdash;from bait box fasteners, to buoys, plastic drums, bits of rope and general rubbish, which were literally strewn everywhere for the whole length of the beach. And that was in an area which is supposedly a pristine wilderness area. That scene did detract from an otherwise excellent and superb walking area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would simply call on those elements in the fishing industry to reassess their waste disposal policy, to take their waste back to harbour and shore and then dispose of it on land. Our environment is our heritage and our bequest to future generations. We, Australians all, have an obligation to care for it and nurture it. We can all make a contribution by carefully minimising the waste we create, reusing what we can and thoughtfully disposing of that which we cannot reuse. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first issue that I wish to pursue today relates to the sending of food parcels and other commodities to the rural areas of New South Wales and Queensland in this time of drought, which is affecting areas to a varying degree. What is happening on some occasions is that these organisations&mdash;very well-meaning and well-intentioned organisations&mdash;are sending commodities and food parcels to areas where there are adequate shops for people to make the purchases themselves. When such organisations send these parcels, they obviously do not consider the effect it will have upon the economies of those communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not just the farmers who are finding cash flows tight in this time of drought, it is also small businesses. The sending of food parcels, staples and food commodities to these drought affected areas is having a serious detrimental effect upon the businesses and shops in those areas. I would call upon those people who are involved in this&mdash;and I am not being critical of them in any way, I just do not think that they have thought through fully the ramifications of their actions&mdash;to talk to the local people and community organisations to work out the best methods of providing assistance to those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sending of food parcels directly impacts upon the income of businesses, shops and stores in drought affected areas by reducing their incomes and, of course, this is seriously affecting the viability of those businesses. When the drought is over, those businesses are going to be needed in the restocking of those areas. However, if they are forced to close because of organisations sending in food parcels, staples and commodities, then the area that they serve will deteriorate further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That infrastructure is absolutely essential to the continuation of those communities. Some of the communities are quite small and may have only one store. The last thing that that store needs, as it tries to eke out its living, is for someone to render it nonviable. No-one can stay, out of the goodness of their heart, waiting for the drought to end and waiting for rain to come and the incomes of farmers to increase, with no income for themselves. So it is not just the farmers who have these problems, it is also the small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that the issue was also raised at the Diocesan Synod of the Anglican Church that is based in Bathurst. It covers the western areas of New South Wales. There is an article in a newspaper out there which clearly states that 10 tonnes of potatoes were sent to Bourke. That is very commendable on the part of the people sending it, but it means that the stores and the greengrocers in Bourke will not be selling any potatoes. I am aware from some conversations with the ABC that one of the large food producers&mdash;a large food canning company&mdash;is sending a load of canned fruit and vegetables. Wherever this goes, it will mean that the shops in that community are not going to be selling those commodities. As I said, that has a detrimental effect upon the income of those shops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would urge people to think very carefully about how they give assistance to organisations. I would also urge organisations to think very carefully about how they are rendering assistance. I have spoken to people in the Smith Family in New South Wales and they have assured me that they are giving cheques and cash. Farmhand is also giving money. Giving people money has a twofold effect: it means that the money is being spent in the community in which the person receiving it lives; and it also means that the people receiving the aid are able, like everybody else, to walk into the shop to buy their commodities, their food or whatever it is they wish to purchase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people are given money they do not feel as though they are labelled and they do not feel stigmatised by having a voucher or by having to identify themselves by saying, `I need some assistance. I need a food parcel.' Giving cash helps maintain the dignity of the people who are in need of assistance and it also has a beneficial impact on the businesses, industries and shops in the areas that are being assisted. I urge people to think carefully about this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not the only person who has raised this issue. It was raised at the diocesan synod. It has also been raised by the Mayor of Gilgandra, Carol Packham. From a news item that I have heard, I know that she is also concerned about what can be happening. It is not happening only to those areas that are classified in extreme drought; it is happening in large areas where people think and know that the drought is, but where it has not yet reached the extreme stage. I urge people to be conscious of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association of Queensland has also highlighted this as a problem for its members. I urge those people who are involved in sending out and delivering aid and assistance to those people in need to think carefully about the best ways of providing that assistance. I suggest that the best way would be to talk to local government in the areas that are affected, and talk to community organisations and make sure that those community organisations are actually using cash, or, if they are providing physical assistance, that those goods are being purchased in the areas in which they are going to be given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people talk to the local branches of organisations which are involved in the provision of assistance to the community groups&mdash;St Vincent de Paul, the Smith Family, Centrecare, Careforce&mdash;I ask them please to be aware that there is an absolutely essential need to make sure that the goods used in assisting people are purchased in the areas in which they are going to be given. We cannot afford to have those areas harmed any more than the drought is doing. We do not want to add  unthinking assistance to what nature is doing. Unthinking damage can be done by people who, with all the best intentions, want to help people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those people who are involved in the provision of aid and those people who want to make food parcels, my plea today is: do not do it. Talk to people who are involved in the provision of assistance and look at the best ways that you can provide the assistance. There are ways that you can provide assistance that will help not just the farmers, but also the small businesses and industries in those towns. As I said before, we very much need those industries and businesses in those towns when the drought breaks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I wish to pursue today relates to superannuation and the problems that widows and widowers have after their spouse, who was on a superannuation pension, dies and they have to transfer across. Members may recall that I spoke earlier on an issue related to superannuation. Following my husband's death, I was not eligible for a spouse pension on his superannuation because, prior to our marriage, he had been discharged from the New South Wales Police Force for medical reasons. That does not affect me financially, but it could affect others.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue that I am aware of, and am becoming more aware of since I raised it, is the fact that when the pensioner dies the superannuation pension ceases on the date of death. I am reliably informed by those involved in assisting police widows and widowers that it takes six to eight weeks before the spouse is placed onto the spouse pension. In my dealings with the New South Wales State Superannuation Board I was callously told, with no feeling, no concern or anything, `Go and talk to Social Security'. I have had reported to me again that those comments are still being made to people. There has to be a better and more understanding way to handle the transfer of widows and widowers across to their superannuation pension entitlements following the death of the person who was the initial superannuant pensioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise this because the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is looking at women and superannuation. Most of the people affected by this are women, and I want to raise this today so that I can raise the consciousness level of people and organisations out there dealing with superannuation and women, particularly those dealing with widows and widowers receiving the spouse component of their deceased spouse's superannuation pension, so that they can be aware of it. Then we can actually raise it as an issue; we can raise it as something for people to think about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an issue that I had not given any thought to until it actually happened to me, and I guess most people are in that situation. But I urge those people who are concerned about the lack of a seamless transfer from one superannuation pension to the other to address this issue. They would be well advised to address it to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. It is an issue that I want to pursue, and I have given notice to the committee that I want to pursue that within the committee because I think it is a very important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a traumatic enough time for people when they lose their spouse; but it is even worse for some. Most of these people are not, as I am, under 50. Most of those who are affected by this are in their 60s, 70s, 80s or even 90s. They are frail, elderly, suffering from the trauma of having lost their spouse&mdash;and they may have been married for up to 50 or 60 years&mdash;and suddenly they do not know what to do or how or where to do it. They are facing a reduction in their income anyway. The last thing they or their family need to be told when they talk to these people on the phone is, `You have got to talk to Social Security, you have to fill out forms and you have to provide a death certificate&mdash;you have to do all of these things.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Death certificates take some weeks to come through. If, in an unfortunate situation, there has been a coronial inquiry or something like that, then that also may delay the issuing of a death certificate. It may delay the whole fixing up of this issue and add extra strain and burden to those people who are bereaved. I urge anybody who is aware of this situation to think carefully about it, and think through just how seamless is the transfer of superannuation pensions from one spouse to another upon a spouse's death. It is an issue that is of great concern to women, and it is one that we tend to overlook until we actually experience it. </PARA>

There is a matter of basic principle involved here&mdash;the principle of prime ministers taking risks when they are Prime Minister. Surely it is proper, and everyone accepts it as proper, for ministers of the Crown to report to their Prime Minister&mdash;as is required under the cabinet rules&mdash;whenever they undertake the purchase of assets or the acceptance of liabilities of any substance at all. The amount has to be reported to the Prime Minister. Those are the cabinet rules.

We are aware of that from former Prime Minister Hawke's own mouth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that there is that requirement; in other words, a recognition of the potential for conflict of interest requires ministers to report to their Prime Minister. Who does the Prime Minister report to when he enters a risky, high exposure, big borrowing, commercial venture? Who does he report to? Himself. Because that is an unacceptable situation, it explains why prime ministers as a matter of principle have not entered new, risk taking, high borrowing, commercial ventures while Prime Minister. </PARA>

In this case, the electorate did not know that this Prime Minister was going to have to borrow over $1 million and up to $1.5 million on a commercial venture. We know that this purchase of the $2.2 million Woollahra mansion is a commercial venture because Senator Evans told us so.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to mention initially two seminars which are being conducted in different cities around Australia. The first is a seminar in which senior experts from the grants and loans division of Austrade and officials from the Export Finance Insurance Corporation, from Ausindustry, within Senator Cook's portfolio, will discuss a range of government financial assistance available to exporters. It continues to be a cause for concern that many people eligible for assistance are not aware of the assistance that might be available to them, particularly those in small to medium sized enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second seminar, Asian Development Bank officials will outline that institution's lending to developing countries in this region and advise firms how best to pursue the $6 billion worth of projects arising from it. Once again, I think that is the sort of information that will be particularly valuable to small and medium enterprises which do not have ready access to that level of information. The BHPs and CSRs are quite capable of finding out that information for themselves but the small to medium enterprises tend to need the focal point and the coordinating activity of government to get access to that information.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to two measured effects of government benefits to small to medium enterprises which I think will be valuable for senators. We get a lot of statements of opinion here, but these are some independent evaluations of the value of particular projects, particularly to small to medium enterprises. The first one is the EMDG scheme&mdash;the export market development grants scheme&mdash;which, as senators will know, is particularly of value to smaller enterprises. That evaluation, as senators may recall because it has been debated here before, suggested that mature exporters generate 15 to 25 times the value of the grants paid in export income. In fact, ITES, the trade enhancement scheme, has an even higher ratio.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More recently, there was an AGB McNair survey which suggested that Austrade helped exporters make $4.8 billion in new sales in the 1993-94 financial year, which is equivalent to 31 times Austrade's running costs to support Australian businesses overseas and a 14 per cent improvement on the previous year's assessment of Austrade's performance. Significantly, the survey showed that small and medium enterprises with turnovers of less than $50 million made up 71 per cent of Austrade's client base and roughly 50 per cent of the clients were small enterprises with annual turnovers of less than $10 million. I think that is a very encouraging and positive picture in the context of International Business Week.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the minister to his answer yesterday concerning his recent appointments, reappointments and non-reappointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal and to his previous advice to me that the three-person advisory panel that he appointed to advise him on these appointments included the tribunal chairman, who is a former deputy leader of the Labor opposition in the Northern Territory parliament, and a member of his own ministerial office. Can the minister explain how a small three-person committee which includes a member of his own staff can possibly be considered to be politically independent and capable of making objective, non-political recommendations on such sensitive appointments? Can he also advise which appointments were made either against or without the recommendations of the advisory panel and which panel recommendations for appointment or reappointment he rejected?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, as I said yesterday, Senator Short's lack of knowledge in this area is continually surprising. Let me take Senator Short back to what we are talking about. We are talking about appointments by government to a tribunal. We are talking about appointments that traditionally and historically have been made by government at government's discretion. Not only is it a fact of history, but in December 1992 a committee, which had been tasked with reviewing the whole area of non-adversarial immigration decision making, reported to the parliament. That committee was chaired by Mr Ian Macphee, a former Liberal member of parliament and a former immigration minister of the Commonwealth. That committee reported as to the role and the whole concept of making decisions and appointments in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Green Jobs in Industry</EMPHASIS> report was partly funded by the Department of Employment, Education and Training and was produced by the Green Jobs Unit&mdash;a joint initiative of the ACTU and the ACF. The report shows that new jobs and economic growth are just two of the benefits Australia can realise by focusing on preserving its environment in industries such as waste management, recycling, energy efficiency and ecotourism. Between 1988 and 1993, growth in environmental jobs was 38 per cent. The report estimates that the industry currently employs up to 400,000 Australians and by the year 2000 we can expect as many as 700,000 people in Australia to be employed in these industries. Of course, this will make a significant impact on unemployment while preserving our environment and generating economic growth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report was launched in Melbourne at Encore Rubber Technologies, part of the Pacific Dunlop rubber group, which is an outstanding example of the potential for green jobs. Encore Rubber Technologies recycles tyres to produce products which can be used for applications such as road construction, watering systems and pavers. To date, more than 50 new jobs have been created because of this venture.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another example is Memtec, an Australian based multinational company in the water and waste industry, which has taken its revolutionary self-cleaning, continuous microfiltration system out to the world, created new markets and jobs employing more than 1,000 people. We have also had examples of the MFP in Adelaide developing new technologies in environmental remediation that are already attracting overseas interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, one very significant opportunity for growth in green jobs is the continuing development of exports of Australian environmental management expertise. Already the environmental management industry is valued at $200 billion worldwide, while the global market for environmental management is predicted to reach some $600 billion by the year 2000. To meet this challenge the government will provide $4 1/2 million through the industry portfolio to develop a coordinated environmental management industry strategy. This will include the establishment of the project development and technology diffusion network to harness Australia's environmental research capability, to overcome problems of scale and to promote exports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is committed to supporting the development of this industry. We win in two ways. We win in creating economic wealth and jobs and we win in preserving a sustainable economy with a sustainable environment in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The chuditch recovery plan incorporates research and management actions in forest areas to ensure the continued survival of the chuditch. The recovery plan provides that `under current silviculture guidelines, habitat trees and suitable logs and stumps are retained during timber harvesting operations to provide refuge for hole-nesting fauna, including chuditch'. Research into the effectiveness of silviculture guidelines for chuditch conservation was recently commenced at Kingston and Warwick forest blocks near Manjimup, and this study includes pre-harvesting surveys on chuditch and monitoring for three years after harvesting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From 1991-92 to 1993-94 the Commonwealth provided $250,100 to the chuditch recovery plan through its endangered species program. Commitment for 1994-95 is $85,400 and for 1995-96 is $75,000.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his question. He is right&mdash;I did announce a few weeks ago that I would be setting up a committee to look at this area of policy, and this question gives me an opportunity to give the Senate an update of that process. I mentioned then, and I re-emphasise now, that over the past decade there has been an irreversible trend in world affairs&mdash;and that, of course, is the increasing globalisation of business. This is going ahead in leaps and bounds. With internationalisation and globalisation, ideas, skills and technology are moving around the world more quickly than ever before.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This, of course, has had an impact on the temporary flow of migrants into and out of Australia. This has also been increasingly reflected in our temporary entry figures. In the last financial year, for instance, some 13,030 temporary resident visas were granted to highly skilled specialists and business people. Most of these people, some 55 per cent, wanted to stay in Australia for less than 12 months. Only 0.3 per cent intended to stay in Australia for more than four years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policy objective for this government is to place Australia, through our rules and regulations in this temporary migration area, in a position to benefit both now and into the future. If we are going to benefit fully by this exchange, it is crucial that we ensure the smooth movement of key personnel into and out of this country. Policies such as those covering temporary migration need to be reviewed to ensure that they not only reflect the current demands but meet the emerging needs of the next five to 10 years. I say in this context that it is a two-way flow we are talking about here. An increasing number of Australians are living and working overseas for short periods. I think the trade potential that is available to Australia through those contacts&mdash;the cultural expertise and awareness of other countries&mdash;is going to be extremely important as we expand our export and trade base.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to be able to announce to the Senate that a number of very highly qualified and experienced people have accepted my invitation to form the committee inquiring into the temporary entry into Australia of business people and highly skilled specialists.

Clearly this is a committee with a wealth of practical experience of international business. It will be invaluable in assessing how our immigration procedures and policies can best respond to those imperatives I mentioned earlier.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has called for submissions. The first advertisements were placed in the national media on the weekend. The committee hopes to be able to produce a discussion paper for public comment by the end of the year. The committee's terms of reference essentially are to assess how our policies and procedures are working; to look at our existing criteria; to look at labour market testing procedures, including labour market agreements; to look at our obligations under the general agreement on trades and services; and to look at our policy of achieving closer ties with the APEC region.</PARA>

At this point I must say that I commend all the members of the committee, including its chairman, for the extremely positive role it played in this exercise. I stress that it was a Department of Social Security exercise&mdash;and quite properly. It was principally an in-house exercise for the purpose of alerting the department's own social security officers, and in an extremely short space of time, I might say.

On the one hand Mr Causley&mdash;and he cannot have it both ways, although he is trying to&mdash;is criticising the federal government for the decision that it took on the 24 months out of 36 months criterion which, I inform the Senate, I took deliberately to advantage New South Wales.</PARA>

As a result of that decision, 15 districts in New South Wales have been assisted, instead of the one or six that the shadow minister would have had. Instead of complaining about it, those opposite should be applauding it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Minister Bilney's remarks have been quoted out of context on more than one occasion. His statement after the Cairo Conference was that a strong case could be made for stabilising population in all nations, including Australia, but that in Australia, from the point of view of simple numbers, there was no urgency. In simple terms, this is an acceptance that population growth is seen as a global concern, a principle embedded in the Program of Action agreed at Cairo.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia supports the efforts being made by countries where population growth rates are outstripping growth in economic and social development and threatening natural resources, to stabilise population and to achieve that stabilisation through policies which integrate the wider provision of basic health and family planning services with programs to address gender inequality and social and economic disadvantage. As a developed country which has completed its demographic transition to slower rates of population growth, Australia's requirements are clearly quite different in nature and are currently addressed through a range of policies, including those on migration, environment, and family planning. I expect to be making a statement to Parliament on these matters shortly.</PARA>

Such a misrepresentation has occurred in this instance, particularly since this remark of Minister Bilney's was made some time before the Cairo Conference, and has been taken out of context.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is shameful and embarrassing. It is embarrassing not only to them but to the nation as a whole. It is important, therefore, to put on the record exactly what they have been saying about each other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It all started a few days ago when the current Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in a typical way, claimed that the prosecution of the Gulf War had not been done competently. Basically, what he said, with all the benefits of hindsight, was that it should have been prosecuted to an end to Saddam Hussein himself. That is interesting in itself, but then we learn that it is to the background that Mr Keating did not even believe that Australia should be involved in the Gulf War. We learned that from his predecessor, the former Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. Mr Hawke, of course, in the book that was to make him a lot of money, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating was opposed on the grounds that we did not owe the US such support.</PARA>
<PARA>He, in turn, quotes Keating as saying, `What has the US done for us?' So there we have Mr Keating going public, lecturing the world on how it should have prosecuted the Gulf War, when it seems that in his view we should not even have been involved because he did not believe we owed the US a favour. No understanding of the international dimensions of the conflict; no understanding of the UN role in it and the Security Council resolutions. He had a personal view; he said that we should not be involved, and so Hawke has recorded it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened then was that Mr Hawke sought to put the record straight; to remind the Australian public of what he had said in his book. What was Keating's response on the record last night? He was reminded of what Bob Hawke had said, and he was asked the question, `Did you support involvement in the Gulf War or not?' The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said, `I did. That is just a straight lie.' In other words, he said his predecessor was publicly lying to gain himself the sale of some of his books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What happened today? Mr Hawke decided that he would get back into the debate. What did he say about his successor, Mr Keating, the current Prime Minister of this country? Mr Hawke was asked, `What's your reaction? Are you a liar?' His answer was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course I'm not and fortunately the record makes it absolutely clear and shows who was the liar in this matter. The record of that meeting of the 29th of November is as follows. Keating started arguing that we should not do anything: `What has the US ever done for us?'</PARA>
<PARA>As I said in question time, Mr Hawke went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul stop trying to rewrite history . . . Now stop it Paul, don't tell lies, the record shows that you're lying, get on with running the country, that's what your job is, not trying to rewrite history.</PARA>
<PARA>A little later in the interview Mr Hawke is speaking of the current Prime Minister, his successor, Labor's leader, in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is incapable of telling the truth on the substantive issues.</PARA>
<PARA>How embarrassing! How degrading to see this spectacle continuing. But there is an important issue beyond that, and that is: who is telling the truth? We are entitled to know whether Mr Keating did believe that Australia should be a party to that international effort to stop Saddam Hussein in his invasion of Kuwait. So we asked the foreign minister, Senator Gareth Evans, who, we understand, was present at the meeting of the 29th: `Who was telling the truth?' Senator Evans said, `My memory is blurred.' This is the person who keeps detailed records of all these things. He knows what the truth is. The truth is that he is not prepared to get up here today and acknowledge that in fact Mr Keating's view was that we were not prepared to be part of the conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If ever that was to be demonstrated, it was in the answer by Senator Robert Ray to Senator Newman's question today when she asked, `Who was telling the truth about the FA18s?' Mr Keating says he argued against them being committed. Mr Hawke says there was never any suggestion of them being committed. Senator Newman puts the question to Senator Ray, and what does he say? He says, `I am not going to answer the question.' He is not going to stand behind his leader. He is not prepared to stand behind Mr Keating. The whole thing is just an embarrassment to the nation as well as to themselves, and they ought to be condemned. </PARA>

The nation deserves to know that when it goes to war, the decision is based on a properly considered and rational basis. The minister's silence reflects the embarrassment of the government.

We do not need a great deal of evidence about this, but it is worth pointing out&mdash;and I think it was in Mr Hawke's book&mdash;that there was some suggestion that there may have been the need to have F111s in the gulf. I think that suggestion was made quite early on. Maybe Mr Keating is just being incompetent and does not know the difference between an F111 and an FA18. There are many instances where one could say that Mr Keating was not really&mdash;in Mr Hawke's terms&mdash;lying; he just did not know.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to follow on from the remarks of my colleague Senator Michael Baume in relation to what Senator Robert Ray did in this matter. Basically, what Senator Ray has done is to say that it is better to say nothing than to lie. Basically, that is the approach he has taken in this matter. This, of course, is clearly understandable, given the difficulty in which he finds himself and the Labor Party, and his expectation of possibly becoming leader in this place after the current leader moves on to the other house.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Interestingly, despite Paul Keating's protestations about how gung-ho he was and what a big man he was in wanting to finish off Saddam Hussein, it now becomes clear that he did not want to get involved at all. It is really a little Jack Falstaff episode, of somebody trying to stab a dead body and saying, `Look what I've done. Aren't I great?' The simple fact is that the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) was too wimpish in relation to this matter. When it all blew over and was a success, he wanted to be part of the success.

<PARA>Following yesterday's question without notice and the taking note of the answer, I was involved in an interview on ABC regional radio, which also involved Mr Jack Wood from CSL and a spokesperson from the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia. Interestingly, the Haemophilia Foundation of Australia said that it had repeatedly asked CSL whether it had mixed plasma from other countries with Australian plasma. It was always told that plasma from Australia and New Zealand only had been mixed; no plasma from other countries had been mixed. The foundation was surprised at the information I produced which showed that CSL clearly was mixing plasma from Papua New Guinea, the Pacific islands and South-East Asia with plasma from Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the same interview, Mr Jack Wood maintained that the practice had stopped in mid-1980, yet there is evidence, on CSL's own letterhead, which shows that it continued until at least May 1986. The practice was vigorously defended then as being absolutely necessary. At this time, the Red Cross Blood Transfusion Service wrote to CSL and said that, on the basis of CSL's refusal to change this practice and legal advice it received with regard to the liability which the Red Cross would have to bear, it was no longer prepared to use CSL blood products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is evidence to show that this practice did not cease in 1986 but continued. In 1984, an independent review by a senior officer of the national biological standards laboratory revealed that the sterilisation of CSL's blood products was inadequate. Despite the fact that this officer made proposals for improvement, it seems very likely that there was no change in these practices until at least December 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: when CSL was sold, was there an indemnity to cover the new owners so that they would not be liable in the event of a claim relating to blood plasma which came from mixed plasma&mdash;that is, containing plasma other than from New Zealand and Australia? If that indemnity was not there, were the prospective new owners, who would have bought shares in response to the prospectus, informed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact of the matter is that the prospectus associated with the sale of CSL did not mention this practice. Indeed, the indemnities given at the time were very carefully crafted to provide an indemnity with respect to products made from Australian and New Zealand plasma but not plasma coming from other countries. Yet we know from quite a lot of other evidence that these sources were being used. Clearly, there is now a possibility of charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister dealt extensively with the processes by which the inquiry was conducted leading up to that sale but did not deal at all with either the indemnities or the prospectus. He concluded his remarks by talking about the share prices of CSL. We can only speculate about what the share price of CSL will be when the claims for contaminated products start flowing in. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA>It would seem that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Senator Bolkus, simply cannot take a trick on some of the key issues relating to his portfolio. Yesterday, in answering a question from Senator Short regarding concerns about certain appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal, the minister was at great pains to establish that appointments were made on the recommendations of an independent panel. I will quote part of Senator Bolkus's answer from yesterday's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The jobs were advertised, a list of people was assessed by a panel, that panel made recommendations to me and, in many of those instances, I accepted their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA>Further on, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I have gone out of my way to ensure that the people appointed are independent of any influence from me and from the department.</PARA>
<PARA>And still later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I want to see people in these positions who are not beholden either to me or to the immigration department . . .</PARA>
<PARA>But today, in answer to another question from Senator Short, he let the cat out of the bag and, in the process, demonstrated his complete inconsistency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, Senator Bolkus acknowledged that the three-person assessment panel recommending the appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal included, one, the former deputy leader of the Labor opposition in the Northern Territory and, two, a member of his own staff. That hardly constitutes a majority on the panel who could claim to be politically independent. Then, in a complete turnaround from his attempt yesterday to create this myth of independence, he cited the conclusions of the committee headed by Ian Macphee&mdash;that it was up to the government to make its own appointments in this area. The minister simply cannot have it both ways. It is clear that today, under questioning from Senator Short, he has been found out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Short showed that the minister's claim to independent advice is false. The minister now claims the right to make appointments as he pleases. Had the minister not been found out, he undoubtedly would have sought to perpetuate this myth of independence. As we have seen today, that is all it is&mdash;nothing more than a myth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no better exemplified than with the appointment in South Australia of Mr Harry Alvizos as a full-time member of the Immigration Review Tribunal. There is no doubt that this is a mates-rates appointment if ever there was one. It mirrors what has been going on with other statutory bodies under this government's administration&mdash;the board of the ABC, to mention just one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this case, we have seen a job given to a person who was present at the minister's recent wedding&mdash;obviously, a personal friend of the minister&mdash;and who has no legal or immigration experience. According to the minister today, his claim to the job is based on the fact that he once taught Alexander Downer's children&mdash;no doubt a very important vocation but hardly a qualification for a full-time member of the Immigration Review Tribunal&mdash;and has some links with the Greek community. No doubt that is also commendable but it is not really the sort of experience of immigration issues and immigration law that would give him the expertise for this very important full-time appointment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no evidence presented by the minister today that this appointment was recommended by the advisory panel or, indeed, that this particular appointee was even interviewed to determine his suitability for the appointment. So it is no wonder that in question time today the minister dissembled to the Senate in answering the question that Senator Short put to him on this particular appointment and the general procedures relating to appointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal. He has certainly been caught out and severely embarrassed over the way he is administering his department&mdash;administering it, no doubt, as his own personal fiefdom rather than with the independence and responsibility that ought to apply to appointments of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, the minister has completely changed his position in the space of 24 hours. Yesterday he was at pains to establish the independence of the advice he was receiving and, therefore, the fact that these appointments were beyond political interference. Today he has done a 180-degree turn and not only acknowledged that he has made these appointments himself but also claimed the right to do so. As I said, it was a complete turnaround and a complete inconsistency on the part of the minister. This is an utter demonstration that he is running this department as his own personal fiefdom, probably to the detriment of sound immigration administration in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance is vital to the future of Australia and to the future of the Australian aviation industry, which is one of our great industries and has been historically of incredible importance to a country the size of Australia. If ever there was an example of an incompetent and irresponsible government and an incompetent and irresponsible minister, it is seen in the mismanagement of the Civil Aviation Authority, culminating in the recent Seaview disaster.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Civil Aviation Authority has been a disaster waiting to happen, not because of individuals within the authority but because of flawed government policy and the inaction and ineptitude of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). In his reply to this debate, Senator Collins should address the following questions. Following one of the worst disasters in recent years when nine people tragically lost their lives, why was the minister swanning around the fields of Perisher with his best mate, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)? He was not heard: he was up in Perisher skiing with the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand today that Seaview has been grounded. What has happened is that the chief pilot's licence has been withdrawn which, in effect, grounds the airline. The question the minister should respond to is: why, if there are good reasons for the grounding of Seaview, has it taken 10 days to ground this airline? No-one has attempted to give the answer to that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aviation industry is in chaos and in crisis because the mess that the government has created has resulted in a genuine and understandable fear of flying in the hearts and the minds of the general public of Australia. The minister could be excused if he did not know that anything was wrong, but he did know. My colleague John Sharp, the shadow minister for transport, told him over and over again in the House of Representatives. Not only that, the Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association met the minister on 24 March this year, and because there was no response of any sort and nothing had changed, they wrote to him again on 4 August 1994. The Australian Licensed Aircraft Engineers Association pointed out in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since our meeting with you on 24 March 1994 we have watched with interest and concern the daily unfolding of . . . events concerning the Civil Aviation Authority.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At that meeting we expressed reservations about the ability of the . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to adequately monitor air safety standards.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on. What happened? What did the minister do? John Sharp raised the matter over and over again. We had the licensed engineers, the LAMEs, as they are known, drawing his attention to their concerns, and they are the people who know what goes on within the Civil Aviation Authority and within the aircraft industry. What did the minister do? He did nothing. He did absolutely nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister has a shameful habit of finding a scapegoat he may well, with some justification, turn his attention to his equally accident-prone colleague Senator Collins, who presided over the structural changes of the Civil Aviation Authority from 1990. In fact, it has been said to me over and over again that the minister may well be reaping the whirlwind of what Senator Collins did. After all, what did Minister Brereton do with ANL? He fired the board when the heat was turned on him. In regard to aviation safety, he fired George Macionis, who was implementing government policy. That is what George Macionis was doing. So the minister seeks out a scapegoat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Singling out an executive of the Civil Aviation Authority to take the heat off is no different from blaming the employees of Quintex for the activities of Christopher Skase. The ritual sacking of an individual is the typical coward's way out of attempting to shift the blame and has only served to highlight the minister's own irresponsibility. It was an ad hoc, knee-jerk reaction and no way to run an organisation as important as the Civil Aviation Authority. What is fundamentally wrong is the structure of the Civil Aviation Authority itself whereby the commercial operations of the authority are hopelessly mixed up with its regulatory and surveillance roles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition for some time has been calling for the regulatory arm of the CAA to be structured as a separate body directly responsible to the minister. This must be done as a matter of urgency. Properly managed regulation and surveillance are paramount to restoring confidence to both the industry and the flying public. Australia, until recently, has had an enviable reputation around the world as one of the safest places in which to fly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government and this minister have put that reputation at risk. It is a very serious matter. What it means in practical terms is that the general aviation industry will suffer a further major setback, having barely survived the recession we had to have. This is a minister who was a failure as a state minister in New South Wales. He switched to federal politics and, because he was a mate of the Prime Minister and, more recently&mdash;as I mentioned earlier&mdash;is now a skiing mate, he was given a senior portfolio. This was obviously not based on merit, but on mates' affirmative action. Maybe the 35 per cent rule applies to the mates of the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far, the minister has destroyed the credibility and potential viability of the Australian National Line.

If he does not resign, the Prime Minister should take decisive action&mdash;he prides himself on this, so I read in the papers in recent days&mdash;and fire the minister before he does any more damage to this industry. Finally, if this chamber were of a mind that this matter was as serious as I have portrayed, we would support a censure of this minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This matter of public importance canvasses basically the history of safety regulation during the course of this government. That is what I will address my remarks to in terms of the Civil Aviation Authority. I make the obvious point that any air disaster is a major human tragedy which all of us regret.

There is no question at all that the Civil Aviation Authority has to take a significant amount of the credit for that, as a regulator, along with all the other components of that safety system, including very importantly the pilots, the air traffic controllers and so on. Indeed, I noted the appearance in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Aviation Report</EMPHASIS> of an address by Senator Parer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased to hear it. I have just confirmed what Senator Parer has said&mdash;namely, that the regulator, as part of that aviation safety system that we have in Australia, has to take a great deal of the credit for that enviable record. But that is in RPT operation. It is a fact that in light aircraft operation, charter and general aviation, our record in Australia is no better&mdash;and, I stress, no worse&mdash;than that in comparable countries. As I have said in this parliament on many occasions, that is not something anybody is satisfied with&mdash;and we all should constantly strive to make it better.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the impeccable record of major airline safety that we have in this country, which I hope to God we will continue to have, the statistical information that is available indicates comprehensively and very clearly that the rate of fatal accidents, whether we use the benchmarks of fatal accidents or accidents per hours flown, has remained relatively stable over the past 10 years. The opposition attempts to draw a constant line about the restructuring of the Civil Aviation Authority, which I might add was demanded from one end of the aviation industry to the other, including, as I said before, quite senior members of the coalition&mdash;and I refer to Senator MacGibbon in this respect; I regard him as a senior member of the coalition and, as I have acknowledged before, his expertise is noted. That restructuring was called for by everyone; there was no doubt it had to occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarkable thing is, and it is a great credit to the officers of the Civil Aviation Authority, that the record over that decade has remained constant. I have said publicly, as indeed have ministers before me, that we do not find it satisfactory that the situation with general aviation and charter has remained static. We want to see those figures come down, as I know do the United States and other countries such as Canada which operate comparable systems to Australia. We must strive to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, of course, one of the natures of the beast is that&mdash;and I am sure Senator Mac Gibbon would concede this in respect of light aircraft operation and these bald statistics that do not ever tell the whole story&mdash;when one is talking about private pilots and small aircraft, and particularly single engine aircraft, in respect of which decisions are taken to fly in conditions that should not be flow in, it is very difficult for any regulator to even attempt to bring down that sort of statistic. I can concede immediately that a far heavier responsibility&mdash;and I am sure that Senator MacGibbon agrees with this&mdash;rests with the regulator in respect of aircraft and companies that are operating RPT services. There is no question about that. The regulation should be as rigorous as possible in that regard and, if it is not, immediate action has to be taken to correct that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a major restructure undertaken of the Civil Aviation Authority. It was long overdue. Throughout the period of that restructure, it was not the case that the government and civil aviation restructured in splendid isolation from the industry; in fact, the contrary was absolutely the case. It was done in the closest possible consultation every step of the way with the companies involved, with the staff of those companies and certainly with the unions. I can attest to that in terms of the number of meetings that I know of between the Civil Aviation Authority and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth while to have a brief look at some of the history after the restructuring took place and the establishment of the CAA by the then minister for transport, Senator Evans. The CAA was subsequently under other ministers, including me. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation was created at the same time to provide the investigatory arm. A non-stop period of examination and review then took place in respect of aviation safety. It has not stopped since, and neither should it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was minister I deliberately appointed one of Australia's most respected pilots, Captain Alan Terrell, to the board of the Civil Aviation Authority so that he could chair a safety subcommittee of the board. As all honourable senators know, that resulted in a report, a complete review, by Captain Terrell of the operations across Australia. The regard in which Captain Terrell is held by the aviation industry generally is beyond dispute; in fact, it never was disputed. That report became known as the Terrell report. The report contained a great many recommendations to the Civil Aviation Authority that had to be implemented in order to improve Australia's safety record, particularly in regard to general aviation and light aircraft operation, which we concede without question are the areas that need the closest attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to raise one important issue which is very relevant to the points that the opposition is making today in urging the government to make changes presumably in basic policy and direction. It has been correctly identified by a number of writers&mdash;Tom Burton among them; and I acknowledge this&mdash;that one of the central policy issues involved is the question of cost recovery. This is something, of course, which need not be and should not be, depending on the kind of cost recovery, contradictory to air safety because that should always remain the major focus of the regulator. The question of cost recovery is important in regard to safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have mentioned the Terrell report. I should also mention the safety regulation forum which I established in August 1992. The forum was held in Parliament House. It was set up to give everyone an opportunity to get into a room together&mdash;the LAMEs, who were just mentioned by Senator Parer, the light aircraft operators, the charter operators and the major airline companies&mdash;to examine the report to the Civil Aviation Authority. It was set up so that everyone could have an opportunity, fully and freely, to put on the table any concerns they had about the changes and the CAA's response to the Terrell recommendations and their implementation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I subsequently reported to this parliament, there were none. Everyone expressed satisfaction at that time with the rate of implementation of those recommendations that the Civil Aviation Authority was adopting. I again mention that to stress that there has been constant review and many changes made in this area. I have no doubt that there will need to be more changes in order to bring down the level of accidents that are continuing to occur&mdash;accidents not entirely confined to but particularly involving the general aviation and light aircraft area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised the subject of cost recovery because it is a central policy issue that concerns the government. I noted an article today by Tom Burton, which I must say was reasonably balanced and accurate. There was one error in the article which I do not blame Mr Burton for as it was not an unreasonable assumption to draw when one works on the basis that all cabinet ministers are automatically happy at all times with all government decisions. I do not think that is a sensible assumption to draw. I refer to the central question of cost recovery which, of course, Minister Brereton himself raised in the House of Representatives yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From recollection, a paragraph in Mr Burton's otherwise fairly balanced article makes the point that when the government took a decision some years ago to fully cost recover for safety regulation, Mr Beazley and I were `happy with the decision'. I am not telling any state secrets&mdash;in fact, we issued a number of press releases during the course of the discussions that ensued; this is already a matter of public record&mdash;when I say that the facts are of course that that was not the case. The government did take a decision some years ago when all this was being put together to fully cost recover the cost of safety regulation. And I agree with Tom Burton: it is an important central issue in this debate. That was shortly after I became minister. The original cabinet decision, I might add, also included the decision to fully cost recover for search and rescue as well as for safety regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are, however, that Mr Beazley and I were not happy about that decision. Almost immediately, cabinet reversed its decision on search and rescue and that was put back where it should be&mdash;that is, on the public purse. A decision was then taken by cabinet to defer the implementation of the cost recovery decision by a full 12 months. Subsequently, when it went back to cabinet for what was a very robust debate, cabinet changed its original decision and implemented a 50 per cent regime for cost recovery. I might add that this is all a matter of public record and, indeed, statements were issued at the time by the government explaining it. But it is an important issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The simple reason I raise this issue is to indicate that it is an important issue and that the opposition, regrettably, has no clothes whatsoever to wear. I assume that Senator Parer was part of the discussions that formulated the policy of aviation which the coalition took to the last election. In relation to this issue, this was the only thing the coalition raised in its policy document. It had to do with cost recovery. Not only did the coalition advocate an aggressive stance on full cost recovery in its policy document it took to the last election; the coalition abandoned the transitional arrangements the government had made for the benefit of the light aircraft and general aviation area.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the general tenor of the matter of public importance debate this afternoon. I point out to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Collins) that one does not prove safety by pointing to the number of inquiries which are being carried out or the efforts which are being made to improve safety. They are not in themselves objective measures of safety at all. Indeed, one could argue quite the contrary: the more inquiries one has into safety might be proof that the system is not working safely. If it were working safely, we would not need so many inquiries. I do not know that some of the arguments used by the minister hold water.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if we look at the statistics, we may find that it may well be that one can hold for a time a level of safety free from accidents involving death or injury by good luck rather than by good management. Again, these statistics by themselves, when there is evidence of inadequate practice, are not in themselves a proof of safety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I look at some of the issues that were raised in the House of Representatives by Mr Sharp back in May 1994, I find that the response of Mr Brereton&mdash;I saw it on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> just before I came in here this afternoon&mdash;was that, if Mr Sharp had put these matters before him in some other way, they would have been investigated. When I read Mr Sharp's accusations, which are clearly set out in the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, I find that there is plenty of information there for investigation. If Mr Brereton has not taken that on board and investigated it on the basis of those allegations, I think he is derelict in his duty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it rather strange that the head of the CAA has been sacked at a time when these sorts of accusations are being made in relation to a particular airline and, as I understand it, there is the lack of a definitive conclusion as to what caused the recent crash. One must ask the question: has Mr Macionis simply been used as a scapegoat so the minister can appease those who want some action taken in relation to the CAA?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence was before the minister in the House of Representatives <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. The minister evidently did not take action. Mr Macionis has now been sacked in the absence of evidence as to precisely, as I understand it, what caused the Seaview aircraft to crash. The minister said he had lost confidence in Mr Macionis. But the question is: does his removal solve the problems arising from a whole range of serious allegations made about CAA? And many of those allegations are in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely the removal of one person has little effect on what happens at regional airports around the country, such as at Wagga, where Western Airlines operates, and which has been criticised for its safety standards, or in New South Wales where Monarch Airlines and Seaview Lord Howe Island Pty Ltd are operating. All these airlines have been the subject of serious complaints about safety and operations, involving air inspectors, allegations of corruption, poor safety standards and breaches of licences and general airworthiness. These complaints have evidently not been investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears that Australia's so-called good air transport safety record has been more by good luck than by good management, with the frequency of air incidents rising steadily in recent years. Records show that violations of controlled airspace have soared in recent years, more than doubling from 1987 to 1992 from under 300 to more than 700. From late 1991 to mid-1993 there were at least 27 incidents involving pilot misuse of radios. The Bureau of Air Safety raised serious questions about the CAA following the tragic Monarch crash in New South Wales in June 1993. The concerns about the CAA extend right across the board, with complaints from its own inspectors, commercial pilots, operators and aviation unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As late as April this year, the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation was complaining again about the poor management and operation of the CAA in relation to violations of controlled airspace. The bureau's safety analysis manager, Paul Mayes, said the bureau had heard nothing from the CAA for three months following the publication of a report showing a dramatic rise in airspace violations. There are allegations of CAA inspectors receiving free flying hours with commercial operators in return for `fixing' problems airlines may have in meeting their safety and licensing obligations. There were also serious allegations of a CAA inspector attempting to intervene in a case involving the DPP and a particular airline and have charges against the airline dropped. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, it seems as though the record of the CAA in relation to its internal operations is questionable and merits closer examination, as does the role of the minister and the way he has dealt with the CAA. Immediately after this MPI has concluded, I intend to seek leave to move a censure motion, to be put immediately, against Mr Brereton. I understand from what Senator Parer has said that the opposition will support that. I hope that we can deal with that matter quite expeditiously once this debate is over. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia is facing a crisis of enormous magnitude in the regulation of aviation in this country. For quite a while the Civil Aviation Authority has not enjoyed either the confidence or the respect of the aviation industry. Now the Australian public has no confidence in or respect for the authority. The people to blame for this are members of the government. They created the Civil Aviation Authority, they have directed it and they have managed it. The duplicity of the government in this regard ought to be exposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the years I have asked many questions in this parliament about the operations of the Civil Aviation Authority. I have always been told, especially by the minister at the table, Senator Collins, that it is an arms-length operation. It has the mystique of a government business operation. He has said, `We do not interfere with it in any way at all. We have nothing to do with it.' It is hands off the Civil Aviation Authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what happens? We have a disaster like the Seaview incident, and the minister slips in and fires the person who he thinks is responsible&mdash;the head of the Safety Regulatory Group, Mr Macionis. The minister does not fire the chairman. He does not fire the board in the way he fired the ANL board a few weeks earlier. He does not fire the chief executive officer. He goes way down the ladder and fires a person who is responsible to many superiors in the chain of command. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister cannot have it both ways. He cannot say that it is an arm's length operation and then go right into the structure of it and exert control. The problem is that the government does not know where it wants to go. All it wants to do is to make money out of aviation so that the money it would normally put into aviation, in seeing that people travel safely, can be spent in other directions, by buying votes. The government has a duty to see that passengers who pay for a flight, who learn to fly or who have any aviation service at all, have that service provided to them safely, as it was for so many years in Australia. In short, anybody or any company who flies for hire or reward must meet minimum standards with respect to safety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aviation is not part of general transport activities. It is a special world all of its own. It is a three-dimensional activity, as I have told the Senate many times. It requires certain attitudes and certain approaches. There are more things to think about in aviation than making money. If there is a mechanical problem in flight, the pilot cannot get out and fix it, as is the case with a ship or a truck. I am not saying that the CAA must be run in a wasteful or inefficient way and cost the taxpayers millions. Of course, it has got to be run efficiently, but that is not happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party has been blinded by the economic rationalist argument and the user pays doctrine. I have got an impeccable history of opposing the user pays concept in aviation from the time that the Labor Party introduced it. Senator Collins will affirm that on many occasions he has recognised that I am a maverick in this regard. But I do not walk away from my argument that there is a public interest in aviation and that should be funded from the public purse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the public are entitled to know when they board a 737, for example, to fly between Brisbane and Sydney, that they are going to get there safely and that the aeroplane is not going to fly through a school and kill hundreds of school kids. What I am saying is that the public interest is a broad interest; it does not relate only to the passenger who sits in the aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the formation of the CAA and the FAC we have seen nothing but turmoil because the CAA is directionless. The board must be blamed for this. The board sets the policy, not the detail. It is not able to do so because it does not have either the knowledge or the expertise in aviation. Members of the board are all very nice people and I think they have all got excellent life histories. They are estimable citizens but they do not know what goes on in the aviation world. What is needed on the board of CAA is people who have a deep knowledge of aviation and an operational involvement in contemporary aviation so that they know what is happening, or they need to have successful commercial experience. We have a board composed of people who have neither. Because the board does not have this, it cannot set priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If anything goes wrong, the CAA has a standard response: scream for more people, scream for more money and scream for more draconian legislation. None of those responses is correct. They do not need any more people; they do not need more money; they need correct priorities to get to the task at hand. But they lack the professional knowledge to know what the priorities are. The senior management of the CAA does not have that professional knowledge, either, because its members are professional managers imbued with the belief that if you understand management, you can manage anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the safety regulatory group. Overall, it has a confrontationist approach to the industry. Instead of consulting and advising the industry, it wants to slap heavy fines on it. It is obsessed with money. It costs about $2 an hour if you ring up a person in the group&mdash;about $160 an hour for advice. It picks on the wrong targets. It picks on the small fish rather than going after the people who really matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins talked about the private pilots. I deplore stupidity and poor airmanship in any branch of aviation because it reflects on me as an old airman and on my friends who fly carefully and well. But as a legislator I really cannot legislate to prevent acts of stupidity. If someone wants to go and do something stupid and if I can counsel him against doing it, well and good, but I cannot really prevent him. But as a legislator, I can ensure that there are minimum standards so that the paying public can fly safely. That is not being done because the priorities of the Civil Aviation Authority are not directed in that way. It is too busy pursuing the rabbits. I have gone through that many times in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most difficult area in Australian aviation is undoubtedly the charter operators&mdash;the third level operators. That is the hardest area in which to make money. It is now loaded up with excessive Civil Aviation Authority charges. It is very difficult for these people to stay in business. But there are some characteristics that we know happen in this level of operations. The three common faults in this cash strapped area of aircraft operations are: overloading of aircraft, which is very common; an extension of duty times for aircrew way beyond the statutory level; and inadequate maintenance. The CAA ought to be putting its surveillance activities into that area in order to protect the travelling public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the aircraft that the charter operators are using now are very old. They go back to the 1970s or early 1980s&mdash;the piston driven twins. We have never operated aircraft as old as that for public hire in Australia's aviation history. It is only the turbo prop and the turbine aircraft that are reasonably new. We have got all sorts of evasions going on in the industry. There are pilots coming out of flying schools who want to get into the airlines. The requirement to get into the airlines is to do a certain number of hours with the charter operators. There are charter operators saying to these young pilots, `Pay us $10,000. We will give you an endorsement in a sophisticated aircraft and 30 hours or 40 hours, whatever you need,' and it is all under the lap. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the maintenance side, apart from the mandatory 100 hourly checks&mdash;and probably those are done, on average, at about 150 or 200 hours, way beyond the statutory limits&mdash;no records are kept. Aircraft are being flown with unserviceabilities which are blatantly against the law. Pilots flying for these companies are under pressure not to protest. They are forbidden to enter in the maintenance release the mechanical defects of the aircraft. When they have a problem in flight, they call up the company on radio and, in code or doubletalk, they say, `We've got a vibration problem, it's come back,' or something like that so that the company knows that the unserviceability has come back. But when it lands, there is no entry in the logbooks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my home field of Archerfield a couple of years ago, a twin flew into a hangar, quite tragically. Upon inspection, two logbooks were found in the aircraft. There was a logbook for the pilot which recorded accurately his flying hours so that he could be paid, and there was a maintenance logbook which grossly understated the hours flown. The case for intense surveillance in this area of the industry is overwhelming. With the limited resources that the CAA must have, that is where its priorities should be but that is not where they are going. They are not going there because the CAA does not know the realities of life in aviation in Australia today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was the terrible example of the Monarch crash where the field inspection officer, the surveyor on the ground, said, `This company should not operate; it's not good enough.' Through cowardice or incompetence, his professional advice was not accepted. He was overridden further up the chain and nine people died. Goodness knows what went on in the Seaview case. I will not comment about that. Again, there are grounds to believe that the person on the ground who made the judgment was overruled by a higher authority and that company got an RPT licence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we need in the Civil Aviation Authority is professional skill and professional judgment. We have not got that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to the election of the Labor government, of course, we had the Department of Civil Aviation, which was then changed so that we had the Federal Airports Corporation and the CAA. One looks mostly at commercial areas and the other looks at aircraft safety and the safety of associated services and facilities. It is quite interesting to read what the CAA said during an investigation conducted by a standing committee in 1989. I believe Senator Parer was a member of that committee. The CAA said, very clearly:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the prerogative of the Government and Parliament, within their respective areas of power and responsibility, to set the financial basis and framework within which the CAA is to operate. The Authority's responsibility is to conduct its affairs as efficiently and economically as possible within the framework set for it by the Government and Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very clear statement with which I agree. The government cannot be on every aeroplane and in every airport facility. The government cannot be everywhere. It has to rely on experts who are employed by the CAA to see that systems are in place which guarantee to the greatest extent the safety of the people who fly in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to hear Senator Parer make a comment today on the question of dividing up certain responsibilities within CAA. In the 1989 report there was a dissenting report by Senator MacGibbon, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I record my dissent from the view of my colleagues that there should be no amalgamation of the FAC and CAA.</PARA>
<PARA>The proposition was that there could be an amalgamation. Further on he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the users must have the inalienable right to say what they want to buy.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to be unfair to Senator MacGibbon, but that appears to me to mean that if there were certain requirements to guarantee safety or standards in the operation of aircraft, those airlines should be able to make their own decisions about certain things. If they require CAA to carry out surveillance they would pay CAA to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the matters raised is the question of cost recovery. It is very clear that prior to the establishment of the CAA&mdash;when the DCA was in operation&mdash;there were methods of taxation and charges, even though there may be some alteration to the way in which they now operate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has responded fairly quickly. He has made a submission to the government in relation to the funding of public benefit. When one talks about public benefit and trying to conduct aircraft movements in safety, one has only to look at the attitudes of companies or organisations that fly aeroplanes or run airlines small and large. For instance, the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association of Australia told the committee on that occasion:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there is the continuing saga of the Rescue and Firefighting Services at general aviation airports&mdash;a service which is unnecessary, unwanted and long recognised as a clear case of over provision of service. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as that organisation is concerned there should not be firefighting equipment there at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have criticism because safety is not being guaranteed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today we are debating a matter of public importance proposed by the shadow minister for aviation, Senator Parer: namely, the government's negligent administration of air safety regulations. It is a matter that needs some airing because the coalition warned the government months ago about the tragic events of the past two weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our general criticism of the government's inept handling of the whole of the aviation portfolio goes back to even before the pilots dispute and the Labor government's bungling of that particular issue. The question of air safety in Australia is something that the Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, ought to have been across before he read last weekend's newspapers. He is quoted in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . operational deficiencies are evident in the records of the Civil Aviation Authority&mdash;records that I have had the opportunity of studying in part over the course of the past 48 hours, but not before that time.</PARA>
<PARA>That means that this Minister for Transport, in response to an aircraft disappearing with nine people aboard seven days before&mdash;and in spite of criticism and questions about whether the aircraft was safe, and whether it had been or had not been checked by the CAA&mdash;took seven days to bother to pick up the newspapers. How times have changed. Clearly the minister is tiring of the portfolio or is incapable of handling the pace. It was only in May, in response to a number of questions raised by Mr Sharp in the other place, that Mr Brereton made this touching comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have had this job as Minister for Transport now for four months and I will tell honourable members this: no one will put more energy into guaranteeing the high standards of aviation safety in this country than I.</PARA>
<PARA>He has failed. He has failed dismally. He should resign or he should be sacked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the minister admits now, five months later, that it took him seven days to bother to read CAA documents relating to the matter. The issue of air safety has been one of continuing questioning by the coalition. Over recent years we have highlighted the debacle concerning radar contracts. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were wasted by the CAA because it had to go back and redo the whole radar contract system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is still a dispute over the new provisions for air space management around Australia. We have a current dispute between the CAA and the Bureau of Air Safety over the number of violations of controlled airspace. BASI expressed concern about dangers that were starting to exist in air space management; yet the CAA said, `She'll be right'. The Minister for Transport is responsible for this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shadow minister for transport has been asking Mr Brereton for some time about shonky airlines. The honourable member raised the specific issues of Seaview Airlines in parliament in May. Mr Sharp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A pilot flying for an operator, Seaview Aviation, which flies from the north of New South Wales to Lord Howe Island, claimed that he was sacked on the spot for refusing to fly a plane in which the auto pilot was out,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the same problem in the incident with the Monarch plane.</PARA>
<PARA>About an hour ago&mdash;14 days too late&mdash;the minister revoked Seaview's licence. I would have thought that if he were a minister who was on the ball he would have been a bit quicker in moving on something like that. In May the shadow minister said the following very prophetic words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Monarch air crash is simply the visible tip of a very large and potentially very destructive iceberg. The CAA has obviously fallen down on its prime responsibility to conduct safety regulation of civil air operations in Australia. It has no excuse. The CAA has been given the teeth. The problem is that it is not using them.</PARA>
<PARA>Might I add again that Minister Brereton is in charge of the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of this most recent plane tragedy the coalition has continued to ask questions, but again the answers have not been forthcoming from the minister. The Minister for Transport has said that, living under the flight path of Kingsford Smith airport, he has a particular relationship with airports. Those of us who use Kingsford Smith airport on a regular basis know only too well the trouble and the safety risks that Mr Brereton has exposed us to and the unnecessary cost that he has subjected the commuter airlines to in respect of that airport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His opposition to the development of the third runway is well known. He lobbied hard to stop its construction. With others from the Right wing of the Labor Party he forced expensive consultation processes. Now that the third runway is finished and ready to be used Mr Brereton is refusing to have it opened. We have to wait until there is a vacancy in the schedules of Mr Brereton or Mr Keating to fit in with the opening of the airport to have the ceremony that they obviously want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the meantime, delays at Sydney airport of 40 minutes or more are common. Sometimes we have delays of an hour, sometimes two hours. One commuter airline advised me that these delays are costing airlines something like $1,000 an hour for one Saab aircraft on a holding pattern. Another airline operator advised me that it cost him an additional 7.5 per cent in operating costs to fly to Sydney&mdash;an additional $375,000 a year. No small business can operate with those burdens; burdens that have been put on those commuter airlines by Mr Brereton in not getting on and opening the third runway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Air traffic controllers have sought to have the third runway opened because it would ease their job and make landings and take offs at Sydney safer. Here again we have another safety issue. Aircraft go round and round in circles at Sydney airport for hours. This leads to more problems and more danger of having a crash</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that government contribution to air safety has been reduced from $80 million to about $58 million, and given that the industry has to foot the difference, it is in the government's best interests to ensure that those in the industry are allowed to operate in the most cost-effective way possible. Minister Brereton is not allowing even that to happen. He definitely stands condemned. Keeping planes in the air in holding patterns is no way of ensuring a viable or safe industry. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The CAA was set up by the government in 1987 to carry out several roles. These included the responsibility for setting air safety standards, day-to-day regulation of the aviation industry and operational control of air traffic services. Over the comparatively short life of the CAA, it has become clear that there are flaws in its operations. The Bureau of Air Safety Investigation report on the Monarch accident, which report was produced after the tragic crash in June 1993, made a number of criticisms of the CAA and recommended improvements to the operation and administration of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Transport, Mr Brereton, acted immediately to deal with these criticisms. He announced a major safety strategy review aimed at re-examining the entire field of Australian air safety. He oversaw the implementation of the national aviation safety surveillance program. It provides an ongoing assessment of the safety level of our aviation industry. Most importantly, the minister announced a package of eight safety regulation measures to ensure that the risk of future air safety problems was reduced. The details of these measures would be well known to senators. They were raised in question time yesterday and Senator Collins has also referred to them today, so I will not go over them again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make two points. The first is that the government has clearly recognised the operational flaws of the CAA and has put in place a strategy to deal with them. An important part of this strategy has been the setting up of a parliamentary inquiry into the commuter and general aviation sectors of the Australian aviation industry. Honourable senators would note the similarity in the terms of that inquiry and the wording of this MPI. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A parliamentary inquiry is not nothing; it is not a small thing. I fail to see how the moves by the government to thoroughly investigate the issue of air safety through this inquiry can be said to show negligent administration or a continuing refusal to deal with the problems. There is no doubt that the government has moved decisively to meet the problems and to maintain Australia's good air safety record. The government has shown a willingness to adapt to the changes in the aviation industry with deregulation, at least on a financial level, as well as a commitment to increase the effectiveness and efficiency of Australia's air safety regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the measures were announced, there has been another crash. The Seaview Aero Commander crashed a week ago last Sunday. Like all accidents, this accident will be investigated independently by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation and a report will be made available to the public. All honourable senators would agree that this is a tragedy, and this has been expressed in this MPI before the Senate today. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the brief time available to me this afternoon I would like to raise two issues in the context of air safety. The first issue concerns the impact of deregulation and privatisation on air safety, and the second and related issue concerns the elimination of air traffic control from 80 per cent of this country. The continuing push by this government for deregulation and privatisation in the aviation industry and elsewhere has pushed the safety thresholds to their absolute limits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government has, in part, acknowledged the need for action in this area by establishing an inquiry into the adequacy of air safety standards, it is interesting to note that Dick Smith, the former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, has recently raised serious concerns about an inherent conflict between the various responsibilities of the CAA. On the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> program on ABC radio on 21 July 1994, Mr Smith stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem with the CAA is that its main direction is to put primacy to safety but at the same time the airways side must make a profit as a government business enterprise. The reason they conflict is not so much the profit, it is that they're two totally different things. Running an air traffic control system and making a profit for the government is one thing; regulating aviation safety and airworthiness and pilot standards is totally different. It's a totally different situation. You have a board there which is competent at running a business but does not have the experience to be responsible for the safety of aviation in this country.</PARA>
<PARA>This is indicative of problems in many other sectors of the economy where the push for commercialisation and the  imposition of cost recovery are eroding service standards in favour of economic efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem, which is related to the first, is the elimination of local air traffic control from large sections of the Australian continent. In my state of Western Australia, it is best evidenced at Karratha airport, which has very substantial air traffic due to the many resource projects in the region and the decision by many of the companies working in the region to use fly-in and fly-out staff who rotate on a weekly basis. In addition, there are many small and large helicopters that operate from Karratha airport to service the offshore oil industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem was pre-empted late in 1990 when the elimination of air traffic control was first mooted. The issue was discussed on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A Current Affair</EMPHASIS> on 27 November 1990. Mr Neil Mitchell, a flight service officer, when asked how Australia's safety record compares with that of the rest of the world, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well, Australia has a very high safety standard, but safety comes at a cost and, unfortunately, this is becoming the equation nowadays.</PARA>
<PARA>Peter Wilkinson in summary then stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Civil Aviation Authority's plan is accepted, pilots in G-air space will only have warning of other aircraft in the area, if the two pilots are able to talk to each other directly by radio. The trouble is, when you're talking on the radio yourself, you miss other reports and messages, that's if they've been given in the first place.</PARA>
<PARA>This is certainly a matter of public importance and I am pleased that Senator Parer has provided me with the  opportunity to raise some concerns on this issue. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of the Australian Capital Territory Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is to amend and repeal those parts of the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation which are no longer appropriate now that the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly has enacted its own electoral legislation. The bill provides for transitional arrangements for dealing with disputed qualifications of members of the Assembly and casual vacancies in the period up to the next Assembly election on 18 February 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions arise from a review of the A.C.T. electoral legislation, which was conducted by the A.C.T. Administration and my Department after self-government was granted in 1989. That legislation, the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 and the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988, applied the modified Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to the Territory and provided for the Australian Electoral Commission to conduct Legislative Assembly elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The A.C.T. Legislative Assembly has now passed its own comprehensive electoral legislation, some of which came into effect on 25 August 1994. The A.C.T. Electoral Commission has been established, its functions and powers determined and the procedures for Legislative Assembly elections laid down in the Australian Capital Territory's Electoral Act 1992 as amended in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this is to provide parallel mechanisms for running A.C.T. elections&mdash;the Commonwealth legislation and the A.C.T.'s local legislation. The Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 still serves as a `constitution' for the Territory. Some of its provisions need amendment to permit the transition from the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 to the Electoral Act 1992 of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 on the other hand needs to be repealed to make way for the A.C.T. legislation, with the exception of Section 16, saving that provision which allows Division 2 of Part XXII of the modified Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to apply. This enables the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory to continue to determine issues of disputed qualifications and casual vacancies in the period until 18 February 1995, after which the A.C.T.'s local electoral laws will commence to apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Item 1 of the Schedule to the bill deals with subsection 48(1) of the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988. That subsection currently refers to subsection 10(7) of the Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988, which is repealed by the bill. Item 1 brings the Commonwealth's self-government legislation into line with the Electoral Act 1992 of the Australian Capital Territory in respect of the circumstances following the calling of an extraordinary general election by providing that an ordinary general election shall not be held within 6 months of such an extraordinary general election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Items 2 and 3 of the Schedule amend the Australian Capital Territory (Self-Government) Act 1988 by omitting subsection 67A(2) and subsection 67C(2) and substituting a new subsection 67C(2) to reflect the fact that the Australian Capital Territory now has its own `electoral enactment', the Electoral Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Items 4 and 5 provide for the definition of `registered party' found in the Commonwealth's Australian Capital Territory (Electoral) Act 1988 and in the Electoral Act 1992 of the Australian Capital Territory, to apply respectively before, and on or after 25 August 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June this year the Premier of New South Wales requested the assistance of the Commonwealth Government for the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service. This Government considers that it would be proper for the Commonwealth to provide such assistance as it can in the fight against police corruption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Allegations of corruption within an Australian police service constitute a serious threat to the integrity of the criminal justice system and the safety of the community, not just in the particular jurisdiction, but nationally. All jurisdictions have increased their cooperation in national law enforcement initiatives in response to the national and international threat of organised crime. The corruption of one police agency therefore has the potential to compromise the national law enforcement effort and to jeopardise international law enforcement cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such assistance as can be provided without the need for amendment of legislation is, of course, already being provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part of such assistance should be the provision of any evidence the Commonwealth might have of or in relation to such corruption. In some cases, the Commonwealth can provide relevant information without legislative change being necessary. There are, however, two important instances where specific legislative authority is necessary before information can be communicated to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are in relation to information obtained under the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 and the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. In relation to the latter, in some circumstances it may prevent New South Wales law enforcement agencies, as well as the Commonwealth, from providing relevant information to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matters being inquired into by the Royal Commission include allegations of corrupt activity by police. By their very nature, such allegations of corrupt activity may include secret transactions involving cash payments or other financial benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Financial Transaction Reports Act allow the Royal Commission into the Police Service of NSW to be treated as a law enforcement agency under the Act. This will allow the Director of AUSTRAC (the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre) to pass financial transaction reports information to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The same conditions of access to Financial Transaction Reports information and use of such information will apply to the Royal Commission as currently apply to the Australian Tax Office and to the various law enforcement agencies which currently have access to AUSTRAC's data.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite knowledge in the community that law enforcement agencies use telephone interception as an investigative tool, the telephone is still a major means of communication between criminals. Information relevant to matters other than those the specific subject of a warrant under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act is often obtained by law enforcement agencies. That Act has strict rules about to whom such information may be communicated. As the Act presently stands, no intercepting agency (including such New South Wales agencies as the Crime Commission and the Independent Commission Against Corruption) could pass relevant information to the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments provide for relevant lawfully obtained information to be communicated to the Royal Commission. The Royal Commission will then be able to use that information only for a purpose permitted by the Act. This will include purposes connected with an investigation by the Royal Commission under its terms of reference or a prosecution which has arisen out of an investigation by the Royal Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Royal Commission will not be able to apply for warrants authorising interceptions under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act or itself conduct telephone interceptions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will have no significant financial impact.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The references to provision numbers in the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) in this speech are, unless otherwise indicated, references to provision numbers as they were before the renumbering of the Migration Act 1958 on 1 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, through its proposed changes to section 35 and 36 of the Act (which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively) seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were thought to possess prior to the decision of the High Court in Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration Local Government and Ethnic Affairs in December 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was this decision which gave rise to the commencement of claims against the Commonwealth for compensation for wrongful imprisonment of a number of unauthorised boat arrivals who are usually referred to as boat people. Prior to this decision no one had questioned the use of section 36 of the Act (from December 1989 to September 1994 numbered as section 88) to detain the unauthorised arrivals in question. Indeed, those sections were not challenged in the Lim proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 36 of the Act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of this kind were detained in custody under this section while their claims to remain in Australia were assessed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Lim case other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people were challenged and doubt was subsequently cast upon the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing&mdash;like all other concerned parties&mdash;that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves&mdash;and their legal representatives&mdash;saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention on the basis none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the Government and the Department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New provisions to detain unauthorised boat arrivals came into effect in May 1992 with the commencement of Division 4B of the Act. These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in the Lim case to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992 with the support of the Opposition. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under Division 4B of the Act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to one dollar per day the damages payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the former Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, the Honourable Gerry Hand, declared to parliament, ". . . It is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who arrived here without authority and who have been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA&mdash;and I would repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid when it was established&mdash;is yet to be heard by the High Court. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the "just terms" requirement in the Constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to one dollar per day is constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I earlier remarked, the amendments proposed seek to reflect the Commonwealth's previous understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88), and their operation. Legislative amendments of this kind can be classed as "curative", which retrospectively correct defects discovered in the law or its administration, and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent High Court judgements involving the "just terms" requirement of our Constitution have suggested that this approach of "curative" legislation is an avenue available to the Commonwealth. Indeed the courts, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, have emphasised that it is always open for parliament to correct developments in the law, other than in constitutional matters, where those developments do not accord with parliament's intention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable, and it may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights, but merely gives effect to administrative action already taken. Action, it should be noted, which was previously assumed by all relevant parties to be valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill&mdash;the No. 3 bill&mdash;is substantially identical to the Migration Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 introduced to the Senate on 8 June 1994. The Government has introduced this bill with the intention of placing the Commonwealth in the strongest possible position to defend the claims for compensation. The bill seeks only to achieve the same effect as what was intended by the enactment of section 54RA&mdash;to prevent a possible windfall of a substantial award of damages to persons who arrived in Australia without lawful authority and were held in detention for the legitimate reason of assessing their claims to stay in this country as refugees. In this way, the Government seeks to ensure that section 88 has, and always had, the effect and operation that parliament intended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition parties were swayed in their decision to oppose the curative measures in this bill when it was introduced to the other place by the dissenting report of their members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in it's consideration of the No. 2 bill. That report attempts to distinguish the proposed curative steps in the No. 3 bill from the dollar a day provision on the ground of retrospectivity. This is pure sophistry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 54RA limits any compensation payable to one dollar per day after the cause of action concerned has already arisen. Thus the parliament has already applied retrospective measures to substantially limit the claims of the boat people for compensation. Sufficient doubt has now been placed upon the measures taken to date, for the Government to accept the necessity of pursuing further retrospective measures of a curative nature to ensure that the Commonwealth is in the strongest possible position to defend these claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dissenting report also adopted the line pursued in the submission of the Law Council of Australia before the Committee that the curative measures would distort the relationship between the legislative and judicial arms of government. This submission ignores the well established prerogative of the parliament to legislate so as to affect and alter existing rights at issue in pending litigation without interfering with the exercise of judicial power in a way that is inconsistent with the Constitution. Until the High Court decides otherwise, curative legislation of this nature remains a valid course open to the parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the curative provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to sections 35 and 36 (sections 87 and 88) do not seek to change the operation of those sections, but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of Division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that Department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's obligations under international law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed, or for example is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment also permits the taking and keeping of persons in custody, notwithstanding that the vessel on which those persons departed for Australia might not necessarily be the same vessel on which those persons arrive. It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country, for instance to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the circumstances envisaged by new subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1A)) it is not appropriate that the period for which a person may be detained should be determined by reference to the departure of a vessel from a port. The proposed amendments will, therefore, provide that custody is to be authorised until the person is granted an entry permit; or for such period as is necessary to allow for the person's removal from Australia, following a request in writing from the person to be removed, or after all applications to remain (for example, entry permit applications and applications for refugee status) and associated appeals or reviews have been finalised, or once all consideration of whether the person will be permitted to remain in Australia has been otherwise concluded; or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Act, a person is considered to have entered Australia once they disembark in Australia. Proposed subsection 36(1AB) (subsection 88(1B)) makes it clear that a person is taken not to have entered Australia as a result of temporarily, haphazardly disembarking&mdash;for instance, on an island off the Australian mainland, briefly and without the knowledge of the Australian authorities&mdash;after which the persons then reboard their vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to section 35 (section 87) similarly does not seek to alter its existing operation but instead inserts specific provisions, to avoid any doubts, as to the extent of the power under this section. Under it an officer may, to prevent a person from entering Australia unlawfully, require a vessel to enter a port and require unauthorised persons to remain on that vessel until it arrives at the port.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I repeat that these simple, common-sense amendments, curative in nature, seek no more than to ensure that sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) of the Act have and have had the operation and effect that parliament intends them to have, which is the operation and effect which the Department and Ministers previously understood those provisions to have had.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also inserts a constitutional validity or "reading down" provision. This will provide, unless a contrary intention can be clearly discerned, that where a provision of the Act could have both valid and invalid applications, the provision is not to have the invalid application but is to have every valid application. The provision is similar to and consistent with "reading down" provisions in certain other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the doubt over the validity of section 54RA the Government proposes only one change from the No. 2 bill which the Opposition parties have indicated they will not support. The current bill&mdash;the No. 3 bill&mdash;provides for the repeal of section 54RA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By supporting the curative steps proposed by this bill the parliament can provide the Commonwealth with the strongest possible position for the defence of the boat peoples' claims. In doing so the parliament will not as I have outlined above be embracing retrospectivity for the first time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">parliament has already demonstrated its will to protect the Commonwealth, and the taxpayer, from the potential burden of compensation payments to those unauthorised boat arrivals who were detained under section 88 while their claims to remain in Australia were exhaustively assessed. The Government's commitment to this position is demonstrated by the introduction of the curative measures in this bill.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill provides for immediate financial assistance to farmers experiencing exceptional circumstances due to drought. It is part of a comprehensive package of drought assistance announced by the Prime Minister on 21 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I need hardly remind honourable members of the crippling effect which the current drought is having on significant parts of the rural community. In many areas, the drought is the worst on record and the Bureau of Meteorology does not expect a break before Autumn 1995. Many farmers and their families and the rural communities in which they live are suffering extreme hardship. Indeed the situation is critical in the worst affected parts of Queensland and NSW. Without immediate assistance, the hard work and personal investment of thousands of Australians might well be wasted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package of measures announced by the government is designed to assist farm businesses which could not have anticipated the severity of this drought and ensure basic requirements of farm families are met. In the Prime Minister's words, the package will ensure that we do not leave these people behind. It creates a safety net to provide for the immediate cash flow needs of the worst affected farm families during and after this exceptional drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main elements of the package are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a drought relief payment for those experiencing exceptional circumstances due to drought&mdash;the subject of this bill;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">further measures under the rural adjustment scheme to assist farm businesses; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">further resources for financial and social counselling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package provides for a systematic approach to drought relief based on the principles of the national drought policy. This policy, agreed by all governments in 1992, recognises that drought is a recurring feature of rural Australia which needs to be factored into normal farm management, but acknowledges that government assistance may be required in exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In total, the package is estimated to cost approximately $164 million over two years. This includes the commitment to match donations to the "farmhand" appeal. This appeal has already raised over $5 million from private contributions. This means that, when combined with the government's matching contribution, more than $10 million in additional emergency relief is being provided to the farming community in drought affected areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's response is substantial by any measure and has been applauded by the farm sector and wider community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has also indicated that additional measures will be considered to ameliorate the effects of the current drought and to help our farming community to better prepare for future droughts. These may include further initiatives in the areas of taxation, income equalisation deposits, landcare and climate research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the government has been providing substantial assistance for drought since 1992 through the rural adjustment scheme, rural counselling and landcare. However, further measures have become necessary as the human and social consequences of the drought continue to escalate. In particular, it has become apparent that farm welfare needs are not being adequately addressed by existing government programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought relief payment provided for in this bill is designed to meet this need. It will provide eligible farm families in drought exceptional circumstances areas with cash for basic necessities and services. Payment will be at the level of Job Search Allowance (JSA), including partner allowance and family payments where applicable. Farmers in receipt of a drought relief payment will also receive a health care card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drought relief payment will be subject to both income and off-farm assets tests. Importantly, farm assets will not be included in the assets test and no work activity test will apply in recognition of the special circumstances applying to farmers during exceptional drought.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students from farm families eligible for drought relief payment will also qualify for Austudy assistance. For farm families in exceptional drought circumstances who do not wish to apply for the drought relief payment but wish to access Austudy, provision has been made to waive the Austudy farm assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought relief payments respond to the needs of those farmers most affected by drought exceptional circumstances. It complements the well targeted social security system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drought relief payments will be administered by the department of social security on behalf of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Under the scheme, farmers will first need to obtain a certificate from a state rural adjustment scheme authority confirming that they are experiencing exceptional circumstances due to drought. They will then make application for assistance through one of the regional offices of the Department of Social Security. The quickest way for farmers to have claims assessed will be to ring the drought contact officer at the nearest social security regional office and make an appointment. Where it is difficult for farmers to get to these offices, they should ring their nearest drought contact officer for advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arrangements have already been made for payments to begin this week, backdated to 1 October. Payments will continue for a period of up to six months after the drought has broken, in</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">recognition that the productivity of farms and farm incomes will not recover as soon as it rains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill provides for the introduction of the drought relief payment through amendments to the Farm Household Support Act 1992. It includes minor amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973, Social Security Act 1991 and Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to benefits associated with the drought relief payment and to make necessary consequential changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill also establishes a standing appropriation for drought relief payments to ensure that funds are available to fully meet the claims of all eligible applicants. Interim payments are being made from the advance to the Minister for Finance.</PARA>

In summary, she denied that there was anything like that going on. The upshot was that the dependent spouse rebate of $27.50 was removed and the government, through social security, was to pay out $30 per week or $60 per fortnight. Of course, this was part of the lie campaign that was carried on during the last election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked Senator Crowley for a choice so that those who wished to stay on the same basis could do so, rather than change over to the new system. I asked her the question on 28 February 1994 and she simply said that she could not believe any woman carer would agree to let the earner&mdash;her husband&mdash;keep the allowance and there would be no need for a choice. She wanted two simple systems: the first where the carer got the allowance from social security and the second where the spouse without children rebate would remain the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">She did not want to give a choice. In that matter it had to remain as she thought fit. Whoever introduced this system decided that it would simply be a vote catcher. But it did not really put much more into people's pockets&mdash;only $2.60. Then lo and behold, after Senator Crowley would not even think of allowing a choice, the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) on 25 August made an announcement that there would be a choice. He said that the ones who wanted to remain in the old system would be able to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have found the article. It is in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 25 August and is headed, `Caring allowance provisions altered'. After Senator Crowley denied that there should be any choice, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, said that there would be a choice&mdash;although it meant that people would lose out on about $4 a week by remaining on the spouse without children rebate instead of lining up at Social Security and making application for the $30. For Senator Schacht's benefit, I will read part of this article. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Opposition sought unsuccessfully to introduce similar changes to the legislation which abolishes the dependent spouse with children tax rebate that the new allowance replaces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government did not accept the amendments, but Mr Gear said amendment would be introduced in the Senate to reflect the changes once the detail had been worked out.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the government came up with this big idea, forgot to do its homework and forgot to advise people. The trouble came and Mr Gear decided that, in the final analysis, he had to do something about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having been given a choice, people had to pay $200 a year for it&mdash;and a lot of people will remember that. I remind the Senate that there is only $2.60 difference between the systems. As I have already said a couple of times, providing a choice gives a cost benefit to families of only $4, but I suppose we can thank the Lord for small mercies in this case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All this has caused a great deal of confusion for employers. Originally, under the legislation the start-up date for the home child-care allowance was to be 1 October. But because this government cannot manage its programs, 1 October came and went without the legislation going through. Nevertheless, there were strict instructions in the PAYE tax book for the 29 September pay date&mdash;the last pay date on which the spouse with children rebate was to be deducted from wages. Employers had to omit that and pay the rest in wages. But that did not allow for the tardiness of the government. Anyone who looks at a PAYE tax book will see it there in black and white&mdash;actually, it is in blue and white because that is the colour in which it appears this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What did the government do when the legislation did not go through? It put the onus back on the employers. I have here a copy of a notice that the Australian Taxation Office published. It is headed `Notice to employers, home child care allowance&mdash;tax instalment deductions'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the taxation legislation to abolish the dependent spouse rebate for couples with dependent children are currently before the Parliament. These amendments are complementary to the new social security payment, the Home Child Care Allowance, which commenced on 29 September 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Social Security had already started paying that $30 a week to those who had applied. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employers have no legal authority to alter their employee's tax instalment deductions or to cease rebate claims on behalf of employees without a new employment declaration or written notice from the employee. It is the employee's responsibility to alter their tax instalment deductions by furnishing a new employment declaration to the employer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Employees who have not provided a new employment declaration but who have had their tax instalment deductions automatically adjusted by their employer are entitled to have their rebate entitlements restored. As the legislation before the Parliament is not yet law&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>well, we know that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">there is no requirement under current law for the taxpayer to lodge a new employment declaration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further confusion! It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, employees may <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">choose</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the word `choose' is in italics&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to lodge a new employment declaration to adjust their tax instalment deductions to safeguard against under-paying tax in anticipation of the amendments becoming law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only after the Parliament passes the legislation will employees, whose rebate entitlement changes because of the amendments, be required to lodge a new employment declaration so that their tax instalments reflect their new rebate entitlement. This is the employee's responsibility. Employers should not adjust an employee's tax instalment deductions without a new employment declaration from the employee.</PARA>
<PARA>And there was so much confusion that the tax office supplied a 1 800 telephone number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PAYE book told everyone what they had to do. The tax pack&mdash;which came out in June some time&mdash;contained an application form.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to address the provisional tax uplift factor. I have said time and again in this place that the provisional tax uplift factor should reflect Australia's economy, our inflation rate and those allied things that affect the sort of profit businesses will make. Interestingly, the Australian Democrats have an amendment on this. For the past few weeks they have been running a big line on the uplift factor&mdash;and I thank my colleague Senator O'Chee for his media release about where the blame for this lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been various uplift factors over the last few years&mdash;at one stage it was up as high as 12 and 14 per cent. I ask honourable senators not to hold me to the figure of 14 per cent but it has been at least as high as 12 per cent. In the past, it was set year by year but, with the help of the Democrats, it was locked in at 10 per cent for ever and a day unless there was special legislation. Yet the Democrats, including Senator Kernot today, have stood up in this place berating us for not supporting her amendment that would bring it down to five or six per cent. I can tell Senator Kernot that one of the reasons I will not support the amendment to bring it down to whatever percentage suits her is that the government will not accept it in the House of Representatives. We could then finish up with a factor of 10 per cent. If Senator Kernot cannot see that she is more stupid than I thought she was. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the short time I have left, I would like to address the Royal Flying Doctor Service, RFDS, sales tax amendment, which attempts to bring an exemption back into line with its original purpose&mdash;the removal of sales tax from wireless transceivers which are used mainly to make contact with radio services operated by the RFDS and similar bodies. The exemption was primarily obtained by farmers in the outback but, as an unintended consequence of some past sales tax exemption reclassification act&mdash;I think it was in 1992&mdash;mobile transmitters were removed. That was brought to the attention of the government and the basis for this amendment is to bring them back in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would question the way that the government has gone about this amendment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment, which was made to the definition of `authorised person' . . . basically removed the exemption for people who are authorised to use wireless transceivers&mdash;</PARA>

The point is the bill amends the definition of `authorised persons'. Senator Sherry might be interested to know that section 20.8 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current definition of `authorised person' is amended to allow exemption to a person who is authorised to `operate the wireless transceiver'.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said this before, and I will say it again: if Senator Sherry and Senator Forshaw can show me where in the election material that they put out they told the electorate that they were going to massively raise taxes after the election rather than the contrary, which I can point out to them, where they said they would not raise taxes, I will be the first to come into this chamber and apologise. It is a fair offer, but of course they cannot do that because Senator Sherry, Senator Forshaw and Senator Burns follow Mr Keating, who, it has to be said, was caught out lying again today. Mr Hawke, the former Prime Minister, today referred to Mr Keating as a liar. So if a Labor member called Mr Keating a liar today, I do not have to join the chorus, because he has been caught out yet again.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the comments of my colleagues and their contributions to this debate, and I do not plan to traverse the ground that they have so well covered. Instead, I wish to make just a couple of points in this debate which I think are important. The first point relates to the hearing that the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration had into this bill on Monday, 19 September. I think we were all surprised to hear the evidence that the Treasury brought forward in relation to the calculation of the uplift factor. It was not Dr Ken Henry's finest hour in giving his evidence to that committee, because when we sought advice on just how the government computed the uplift factor Dr Henry said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not have a model which throws out at the end of it some magical figure for the provisional tax uplift factor.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators may remember that Treasury had a magnificent model for Fightback. It spent three-quarters of a million dollars working out how to model Fightback, and threw out tonnes of figures which were carefully tuned and finessed, with peculiar assumptions built in. At the end of the day, the Treasury model spewed out all these figures&mdash;no worries about that&mdash;but the Treasury did not have a model on which to compute its own policies. It came as a bit of a shock to us to find Dr Henry, the great modeller in the Treasury, who was able to spend days, hours&mdash;indeed, months&mdash;modelling the policies of the coalition, did not have the information to model his own policies, the policies of his own government. I think the evidence he gave was very revealing. As I said, it was not Dr Ken Henry's finest hour before any Senate committee, and that has to be conceded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is, of course, as we are aware, great concern in small business about the uplift factor, and rightly so. Dr Henry gave us quite a fascinating figure, I thought. He said, `If the uplift factor were cut back from eight to four per cent, the cost to this year's revenue would be in the order of $320 million.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having first discovered that this figure was not computed but was plucked out of the air by the Treasury, my colleague Senator O'Chee did a bit of research on this matter and asked, `How did all this come about?' Senator O'Chee revealed, I thought rather powerfully, that the uplift factor and the current arrangements were brought about because in 1990 the Democrats persuaded the government to accept their amendment because they considered it wastes the chamber's time to approve the provisional tax level each year. So Senator Spindler felt that was the case. Of course, if that had been included in the budget, there may have been some useful, productive debate on that issue and we may have been able to put some pressure on caucus, as has happened previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to honourable senators that Senator Kernot was part of the budget negotiations. The Democrats are part of the budget process. I think all of us are concerned about issues relating to the uplift factor, but it is interesting that Senator Kernot was there when this budget was being framed. If Senator Spindler had been more cautious in moving his amendments back in 1990 about tax uplift factors, and if this chamber had had to approve those uplift factors, maybe it would have come to Senator Kernot's attention early in the piece. That may well have meant that this issue could have been dealt with more sensibly at an earlier and more practical time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I for one welcome the interest that the Australian Democrats are at last showing in small business. But they have a long way to go because it is the Australian Democrats in this chamber who have constantly called for higher taxes. Their tax policies&mdash;I have made this point before; it is not news&mdash;are an invitation to the government to bring in more taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wash-through effects of these tax increases from the broken promise budget of the 1993 election are still having an impact on small business. There was no complaint from the Democrats about the broken promises of the government, nor was there any complaint, by and large, about the massive tax increases which were imposed in that budget and which are having an impact on small business today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot has referred the issue of provisional tax uplift and a number of other features to the Senate Finance and Public Administration References Committee. I think in such an inquiry we need to look at the overall burden of taxes on small business and the impact of the tax increases which have been imposed by this government since it came into office on the cash flows of small business. When we reflect that 60 per cent of the price of fuel represents government taxes and charges, we can see that we are dealing with a massive tax impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am delighted with anyone who worries about the tax burden on small business. It is a fundamental issue and should be addressed, but we want to make sure that we address the full range of tax issues which relate to small business. In that notorious broken promise budget, we had not only fuel excise increases, which impact on small business, but also wholesale sales tax increases, wine tax increases&mdash;a range of these tax increases. We waited in vain for Senator Kernot and Senator Spindler to join with us to try to prevent these imposts, which have a particularly savage effect on small business. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No.3) is another 90-page tome by the government to try to fix up its tax system. One of the most contentious issues in this bill is the move to eliminate the dependent spouse rebate where the home child care allowance applies. This is the taxation change in relation to setting up the home child care allowance. The government maintains that most of the issues have already been resolved, and that this is only tidying up. The proposal for a compromise approach which allows those eligible for home child care allowance to opt to get the lesser dependent spouse without children rebate seems to conflict with this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with the home child care allowance is that the shift from the tax office assessment of income to the DSS assessment will in many cases increase the figure used as income and change other treatment. The consequence will be that many people effectively will have the amount of money reduced. A few people, where one member of the couple works but does not make enough money to pay tax and the other does not work or does minimum paid work, may be currently eligible for home child care allowance where they get no benefit, or partial benefit now, from a tax rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Home child care allowance is also slightly higher than the dependent spouse with children rebate&mdash;which I shall refer to as the DSR. All except the advantage of the total of home child care allowance over the total of the dependent spouse with children rebate, effectively about $3 per week, may disappear when the parenting allowance is introduced. The allowance will be available to low income earners and includes home child care allowance. The government has agreed to compromise by allowing those eligible for home child care allowance to opt for the dependent spouse without children rebate. Both the coalition and the Australian Democrats are putting up amendments that they hope will ensure that no-one is worse off. We will support amendments that will make it work better. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The best option to my mind would be a simple option for people to apply either for home child care allowance or for the dependent spouse with children rebate. It would be easier to keep the current system intact than to modify it or try to construct a hybrid system, since PAYE taxpayers have the dependent spouse rebate calculated into their contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be simpler because all the mechanisms are already in place at the tax office for both the rebate and the variation in tax deductions under PAYE. Everyone knows how it works. It would avoid any complicated refiguring of rebates in relation to home child care allowance received, and would be received in the pay cheque in reduced tax payments rather than as a refund at the end of the year. It would also allow those who work intermittently to avoid the problem of continually reporting to DSS on changing circumstance. This would have been our option, but there is little point in putting up yet another amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I see other problems in regard to a shift in home child care allowance, but feel that most of these have been stated in the debate that brought the program into being. In general, our position is that home child care allowance basically takes more people from an independent system, where deductions are claimed by right, to a system where they are allowed to apply for a benefit and then become clients, to use the current jargon, of Social Security. Senator Chamarette may make some comments about the use of tax file numbers under this program, further extending the linkage between departmental databases and moving towards the tax file number as a universal identifier, without which a person has very little access to things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue in this bill is in its provision to allow a sales tax credit in respect of sales tax paid in relation to the alteration of goods for export. This exempts from sales tax those components going into exports, which do not include sales tax. Sales tax is applied only to goods sold in domestic markets. Exports are taxed under the domestic sales tax legislation of the country in which sale occurs. Imports are taxed under our sales tax legislation. This change means that we are not exporting goods on which tax has been paid. The opposition wishes to extend this to goods produced for sale to exempt institutions, and we support this move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under previous legislation parts and components going into goods sold to tax-exempt institutions were tax free. Under new legislation they are taxed. This puts the domestic equipment repair and recycling&mdash;or remachining&mdash;industry at a disadvantage relative to imported equipment when selling to tax-free institutions&mdash;and this is one-third of their market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will make components for export tax free. The industry argues that the disincentives for domestic production could and should be fixed now also. The opposition is putting up amendments to do so, which the government says will not work&mdash;for unspecified reasons. The government argues that this is small potatoes and is not worth the trouble. We will support the opposition amendments and, if they do not work, hopefully we will force the government to fix them while complying with the intent. We will support any government bill that more effectively exempts such goods and replaces the opposition amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called remachining industry is labour intensive and waste reducing. It uses and teaches skills that are basically higher level trade skills such as metalwork, machining and electronics, the kind of work that it would be good to see more of in Australia. The issue is that the disincentive is negative for those domestic machining industries, most of which are small or medium-sized enterprises, and it is a disincentive to recycling. This disincentive was Just introduced in tax changes just last year. If it is too insignificant for government to correct, it can be changed without worry about loss of revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the future technology issue, with Europe especially requiring designs which facilitate such repair and recycling, and also the upgradability of new product. It is therefore an area where activity is expected to increase. One problem we have is that government is happy to make small changes to level any economic field where recycling has an advantage&mdash;for example, with paper products&mdash;but is content to allow the field to slope when it allows a disincentive to recycling. Why is this?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government now claims that this change will not result in tax exempt institutions buying more equipment, that buying policies&mdash;mainly government buying policies&mdash;are to blame. We know and accept this. It is not about increasing the total market, but about changing the skew towards imports and away from domestic products within the existing market, a skew which was recently created and which should not exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Government also states that although this skew exists in relation to sales tax exempt institutions, there is a skew in the system favouring domestic producers selling to non-exempt buyers. All I can say is that this does not excuse a skew which affects a market where tax exempt buyers are currently one-third of all buyers. We do not like the threat that if government is forced to correct this negative bias affecting one-third of sales, it will punish the industry by eliminating the positive bias. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens do not favour the famous level playing field. We believe that many community values are not given any value when measures to favour what the community wants are forbidden through regulation forcing free market ideology. We would like to see strong policies which say that things should be recycled and should be made recyclable; and they should be made easily upgradable in order to allow the incorporation of technical improvements without throwing away things we have made. We would like to see buying policies in all public institutions, including government departments, which explicitly state that they should buy recycled goods unless unavailable, and should buy recyclable goods in preference to disposable ones. We believe we should see this happen, but do not expect it with the current government attitude. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we do hope to see is the sort of economic incentive-disincentive program designed to internalise externalities, to make the market work well. This is a minimum, and we do not see it. These would give some preference to recycled and remachined goods. Instead, we see a government that seems to want to remove any such measure to account for the social and environmental cost of waste. It wants to do this to level the playing field, in spite of the fact that the playing field is already slanted by the absence of inclusion of social and environmental costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, whenever the playing field is slanted against recycling, against domestic production that would create jobs, the government seems happy to let it lie and to claim that the effect is insignificant. For this reason, even if the opposition amendment is not perfect, we will support it in the hope that it will send the government a strong message that it cannot keep on the way it is going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also drop provisional tax increase from 10 per cent to eight per cent. This is a government commitment. The Democrats are proposing to drop it to five per cent, and expect coalition support. We will also support this move. The argument here is whether an uplift of eight per cent is still too high, and it is not clear why the uplift will go back to 10 per cent next year. The Democrats proposal for the uplift factor to go to five per cent on a continual basis is probably okay, but it would be better to have an uplift factor that reflects the economic forecasts, for instance inflation, and some factor determined by level of income from work and level from investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps an amendment here would lead government to think about this. One thing is certain: there is little rationale to consider that people with their own income from self-employment or investment will automatically see their income increase by 10 per cent per annum. Ten per cent growth is, after all, higher than most optimistic estimates for economic growth in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also give income and sales tax concessions for regional headquarters of transnational corporations. This is a real little gem. We know that many others in this place support this scheme. The Greens cannot support any scheme that helps in any way the foreign economically powerful, especially through support with Australian taxpayers' money. We are the only people who seem to care about this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why should Australian taxpayers pay for this? In spite of arguments that it is a tax concession, we can bet expenses will be involved in promoting this idea overseas and administering it here at home. Why should they get tax breaks? Is it because the government hopes it will create jobs for lawyers, CPAs, cleaners and those in the hospitality industry? Give us a break! The government should give it to Australian small and medium-sized enterprises if it wants to give it to someone and if it wants to create jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the reportable payments system as well. This involves measures to increase compliance with tax. We generally support increased compliance, particularly at the top end of taxpayers. But this was initially designed to catch people in the clothing and fishing industries. Those are areas in which frequently little tax is paid on a PAYE basis, employers leaving it to employees to pay their own tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the clothing industry, the workers concerned may be women working on a piecework rather than a shift basis. Often these women are poorly paid, are from ethnic minorities and speak poor English. I would like to see these women in more secure employment. I would like to see them better paid. I would like to see some form of negotiated contract that gives them decent wages and conditions, superannuation and so on. It does not appear that this bill or any other proposed bill will do that. The government does not care about them; it just wants its tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the fishing industry, the conditions are also variable. In some cases workers are paid by the day&mdash;in some by the trip. In some cases part of income may be a portion of the catch. Work is also often not steady but is on a `while available' basis&mdash;workers can go out with a ship as long as it is out and the fish in season. In such circumstances, figuring out the tax to be paid as an equivalent to PAYE may be fairly difficult and involved for the payer. It is also the case that the income in any week may have little bearing on annual income, so the correct rate of tax is hard to determine. The payer will also not know what other income a worker may have, and certainly seasonal fishing workers are likely to have other income out of season. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the problems for employers in a more conventional sense, how will this work for the situation in which payers are actually people off the street paying a dressmaker or tailor? Will they be required to withhold tax? How will they process it to pay the Tax Office? Presumably, payees are also small business people who pay company tax or provisional tax, so they will be double taxed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two other issues here. Firstly, the government says this is the first area in this new form of tax and that this is a new form of tax parallel to PAYE and provisional tax. There will be more areas, and this is the thin end of a wedge of indeterminate size. Secondly, the government estimates that, currently, $100 million of tax owed is not being paid by workers in these industries. Is this figure true? What is it based on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill will also deem foreign banks to be separate legal entities, prevent double taxation of foreign sourced income and ensure consistent treatment of some termination payments. None of these issues seem to be problems, but none are overriding reasons to support this bill. There is actually little reason to support this bill as it is presented and some substantive reasons not to. However, given opposition support, the bill will go through. We have, therefore, chosen to support amendments which seek to improve it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's incompetence goes further than that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This most comprehensive taxation bill does cover a wide range of matters in regard to taxation. For a government that desires simplification of tax law&mdash;in particular, corporate tax law&mdash;this bill is evidence that the left hand of the bureaucracy does not know what the right hand is doing. In the Senate we are constantly facing layer upon layer of tax law amendments in the most contorted and longwinded language. Anyone who picks up this piece of legislation and sees this array of amendments and changes will agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every extra dollar taxed on business is a cost and reflects on future investment and employment capabilities. Equally, every extra dollar taxed on households reduces future savings and expenditure. Given that governments are not known for their efficient use of the tax dollar and that it is far more efficient to leave that dollar in the hands of the private sector, the underlying philosophy of tax is the less that government taxes, the greater the efficiency of the economy. Of course, a balance must be drawn, and tax is considered necessary. The problem is the complexity, the interpretation and the calculation of the tax system. It is often regressive in its application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the complex and regressive taxation system, this government has truly made it an art form. Recently, a National Bank survey found that the typical medium size business spends more than 62 working days a year filling out an array of different tax forms and pays the equivalent of another 12 working days on professional advice on how to do it. So it is little wonder that the head of that bank, Don Argus, said that it was quite frightening that 500 hours or 62 working days a year are spent filling out tax forms alone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further official studies on this issue have found that the burden has been increasing, not decreasing. The array of different tax forms includes income tax returns, sales tax, customs, fringe benefits tax, tax instalment deductions, prescribed payments system, Workcare, payroll tax, the training guarantee levy&mdash;although that has now been suspended&mdash;and superannuation forms. There is no end to the number of forms which make up that 62 days or 500 hours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General, Mr Michael Lavarch, has made a good start in simplifying company law. Equally, tax law should be simplified. This is in line with the criteria laid out in the 1985 white paper on the review of the Australian taxation system which indicated that the tenets of a good tax system should be equality, efficiency and simplicity. There has been some advancement on that 1985 statement, but only in the area of tax administration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In August this year, the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, released a response in which he said that only 28 of the 148 recommendations of the JCPA&mdash;the Joint Committee of Public Accounts&mdash;on the administration of the Australian taxation system would be rejected. I reiterate that that is only in the area of tax administration. One of the better recommendations of this committee taken up by the government was the establishment of a small tax claims tribunal as part of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Taxpayers with disputes involving less than $5,000 will gain access to that tax claims tribunal; a minor fee of $50 will be required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before the Senate does bring relief to small business in another area by reducing the uplift factor from 10 per cent to eight per cent. Senator Kernot, for the Australian Democrats, made quite a good point in relation to the uplift factor; that is, although it is a minor change from 10 per cent to eight per cent&mdash;she is calling for a figure of five per cent, I believe&mdash;greater emphasis is given in this legislation not to small business, as it should be, but to incentives for regional headquarters. They are getting a greater tax deduction and greater tax incentives than our own small businesses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that the coalition is not supporting the Democrats' suggestion to reduce the uplift factor to five per cent is simply because, if we do, the legislation will go back to the House of Representatives and the government has told us quite clearly&mdash;and as the financial year rolls on, it looks to be so&mdash;that it will simply revert the uplift factor to 10 per cent. So we will grab this small mercy while we can but we signal that we will be reviewing the matter year by year. Next year we may not hold the same view. Certainly, the uplift factor should be reviewed in relation to keeping it in line with inflation or the government's growth forecasts. This ad hoc approach of making it up as we go along is clearly unsatisfactory and introduces an element of uncertainty, particularly for small business, at a time of uncertainty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business groups have lambasted the very concept of provisional tax; they say it is inequitable. The Chairman of the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, Mr Paul Greenwood, believes that the advance payments of provisional tax are pushing many small businesses to the brink of failure and that there is an absurd situation whereby success hastens bankruptcy because growth requires increases in working capital and early tax payments. It would be known to the government that the concept of provisional tax is not welcomed by small business, and never has been. There has been a long, ongoing battle to get governments to understand the type of burden that provisional tax places on very small businesses in particular in having to find this cash at a time when cash flow is not readily available. So the uplift factor is very important to small business. Governments should not make it up year by year, on an ad hoc basis, but should have some formula that small business can factor in yearly and thus allow for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business also has great complaint about the fringe benefits tax, which would not be news to the government. Again, this has been a longstanding concern for small business&mdash;not just the complexity and the administration of the fringe benefits tax, but the level of the fringe benefits tax. It is seen as an attempt by government to milk every last drop from small business. It has gone beyond the tenet of tax being fair and equitable. It is now simply a tax which is a burden and which is squeezing business so hard that it is directly affecting their employment ability&mdash;their ability to employ that one extra person. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Business has to meet the administration costs and the complexities of the fringe benefits tax, so will simply not put that extra person on. It is an overhead that is directly affecting the employment factors of small business. This is all because of the broadened definition. In the August 1993 budget the government broadened the definition just to grab the extra dollars. Those extra dollars are very significant because in 1986, when the fringe benefits tax was first introduced, the government received some $585 million. The government has now budgeted in the new financial year for over $3 billion in fringe benefits tax. That is a clear signal that this government is simply using this as a revenue raising tax to the hilt, to squeeze every single ounce out of small business. It has reached the absurd situation where business cannot even have a Christmas party without wondering what part of the Christmas party will be taxed. </PARA>

While the food and beverages consumed by the employees will be exempt from fringe benefits tax, the cost of the live band, the comedian and Santa will need to be separately accounted for because the cost of providing non-property entertainment will be subject to FBT. Further, some of business X's major clients are often invited to the Christmas party&mdash;there is nothing unusual about that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, I only want to speak on one aspect of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994, that is, the section dealing with the dependent spouse rebate and changes to the home child-care allowance scheme. This bill allows for payment of the dependent spouse rebate at the lower without-child rate if the taxpayer's spouse is not eligible for the home child-care allowance at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We now see before us additional government amendments to allow for payment of a partial allowance if partial home child-care allowance was available but that amount was less than the person would have received under the dependent spouse rebate. However, this `top up' rebate will be calculated on the dependent spouse rebate without-child rate, and that is the lower rate. Basically, the home child-care allowance will be paid at the rate of $60 a fortnight, or $1,570 a year, for those who have no other income. The dependent spouse rebate with-child rate for 1994-95 was to have been $1,452 a year, or $55.40 a fortnight. Obviously those families with no other income are certainly benefiting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The without-child DSR will be $1,211 a year, or $9.20 a fortnight less than the dependent spouse rebate with-child rate. For a wage earner on, say, $20,000 a year, that is $241 a year less than they would have received under the old dependent spouse rebate arrangements with child. That is the equivalent of effectively losing a week's wage in a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The eligibility for the dependent spouse rebate&mdash;and this is where the problem lies&mdash;was based on an income test of the dependent spouse's net income as defined in the Income Tax Assessment Act, whereas HCCA eligibility will be based on the current income test in the Social Security Act. Unfortunately, this income test is far stricter than the income tax separate net income test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In broad terms, the income tax income test is a net income assessment after work related deductions have been taken off. But the Social Security income test is a gross one with no deductions allowed. I must add here that the Social Security income test also includes unrealised capital gains income on assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result will be that the income of many dependent spouses will be judged to be much higher for the purposes of gaining home child-care allowance than it would have been if that family was applying for the dependent spouse rebate. This will leave many families worse off under the new system. This is despite the assertions of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating)&mdash;and I go back to the 1993 election speech&mdash;that basically HCCA was simply a replacement, a reorganisation, of the dependent spouse rebate. In the speech Mr Keating said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, the Keating Government will increase the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse at home caring for children. The new Home Child Care Allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent income for women at home caring full time for children.</PARA>
<PARA>We obviously have no problems with that, but there was no mention of the fact that many families&mdash;our estimates are up to 200,000&mdash;will be worse off. There was no adequate explanation of the various processes or the tests that would be applied to the new allowance. Indeed, there was no mention of the fact that the government could seek to claw back the cost of the increase by reducing eligibility for the allowance through that tighter Social Security income test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a very extensive public advertising campaign, costing something like $18 million, to tell families how much better off they are going to be. That campaign has been run through women's magazines. I have one here telling us how basically people will be $60 a fortnight better off. At the beginning it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If you stay at home for your children this simple quiz could get you $60 a fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA>I notice the word `could', and that should ring alarm bells for those who are suspicious in the first place. But as one goes through the advertisement, it is not explained that it is in fact a replacement; in other words, while $60 is going into the hands of the spouse who stays at home, the money is no longer able to be claimed through the taxation system by the working spouse. I read very carefully through a number of these advertisements and nowhere does it correctly explain how the system is going to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yes, it has a number on the bottom, but those who have been listening to talk-back radio&mdash;and I am thinking particularly of my home state&mdash;will know that this has created confusion and animosity amongst people who have never had it explained to them. Firstly, they have not been told that it is a replacement; secondly, many people will be worse off, even with the final government amendments that we have before us today. Basically, a family on a low income will be worse off by the equivalent of a week's wage at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Really, the only families that are going to be $60 a fortnight better off are those families who are now so badly off that they pay no tax. In fact, rural families, along with some small business families, are about the only ones whose income has been so low that they did not qualify. Those people could not get the dependent spouse rebate because there was no tax to rebate it off. Therefore, they would be the only people who would get the $60 a fortnight. While this is a good scheme, I would like to have seen advertising that was far more explicit and far more honest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I issued a press release on this matter last week, which the minister criticised, but I will go through some examples of the matters I raised in it now. I take the example of a spouse who stays at home with the children and takes in washing or looks after someone else's children. That spouse is usually the woman. If, as it says in the advertisement, she earns more than just over $10 a fortnight&mdash;which in today's currency means very little but it is an amount that has not changed since the 1970s&mdash;that family will start to run into problems because, effectively, home child-care allowance will cut out, as the dependent spouse rebate did. As soon as she earns $4, she loses $1. So she does not have to earn very much to be in that group affected by that new test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take the example of parents who work part time three days a week, live 15 kilometres from work, buy and dry-clean their own uniforms, claim bank and union fees, pay child-care expenses of, say, $45 a week, and earn, say, $120 a week. The separate net income for the dependent spouse rebate would have been assessed at $1,068 a year. Under the dependent spouse rebate scheme, the working partner would have got back $1,256 through the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with the home child-care allowance, the income will be assessed as $6,240 and, until we see these amendments go through, only $80.50 will be received. These are the sorts of problems people encountered once they began to work out what they were going to get under HCCA as against what they used to get under the dependent spouse rebate. So, under the unamended bill, that sort of family would basically get very little. Under the bill before us, the family would get nothing extra until these additional government amendments go through, which will mean that the family will be only&mdash;only&mdash;$241 a year worse off than before. But then, looking at what the home child-care allowance is adding on, the family would still be worse off by another $4.50 a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Baldwin in the other place said that I was wrong for quoting this example because the family would get the child-care cash rebate&mdash;which it would&mdash;but it would also get that under the dependent spouse rebate. So the disparity between these two examples remains. Thousands of families will be affected. That is not our estimate; it is the estimate of the Australian Taxpayers Association that 200,000 families who currently receive a partial dependent spouse rebate will be worse off even with the government amendments to this bill. If the NRMA float goes ahead in New South Wales, many families in New South Wales who get home child-care allowance will be affected because of the treatment of unrealised capital gains on shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another problem is that the dependent spouse rebate is payable at the higher rate for students aged between 18 and 25; home child-care allowance is not. The dependent spouse rebate is payable when a taxpayer is out of the country; HCCA is not. The government has sought to rectify some of these problems, and our amendments and those of the opposition will  rectify the rest. Our amendment seeks to ensure that, where a family receives less home child-care allowance in a year than it would have been entitled to under the dependent spouse rebate, it can claim the difference on its tax return at the end of the year. The rebate should be at the higher with child rate and not based, as the government wants it to be, on the lower without child amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment would not be necessary if the social security income test was improved. That would have been our preferred position. It is disappointing that we are forced to run this safety net arrangement because of the flaws in the social security income test. The Democrats will be supporting the amendment to be moved by the opposition during the committee stage of this debate, which looks like being tomorrow. We will, however, be seeking to amend the opposition's motion to make it clear that the partial rebate can be claimed only at the end of the financial year. Also, the rebate should not be able to be claimed if the family is eligible for home child-care allowance at the full rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendments are to ensure that HCCA becomes the primary means of assessing predominantly single-income families. In our view, the HCCA system of paying the allowance direct to the care provider rather than the spouse is a very welcome change, particularly given statistics showing that up to 15 per cent of husbands provide their dependent spouses with no income whatsoever. What is needed under the home child-care allowance is a safety net to ensure that no family is worse off under the new system and to give some meat to the Prime Minister's promise to this effect. That is what our amendments and the opposition amendments will seek to achieve. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), which covers a variety of tax changes. There are two changes that I am concerned with and I will direct my contribution to those two amendments. I am very concerned with the harsh approach that the federal government is taking to small business. One of the amendments in this bill today points out the uplift factor that is affecting small business. It goes to prove that, over the years, the Hawke government and now the Keating government have continually been increasing costs at a higher and higher rate on small business and farmers. They have been the real victims of Mr Keating's regime as Treasurer and now as Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the worst areas to affect small business and primary industry is the regime of high interest rates. We have heard a lot of discussion over the past two months about drought. The drought is a very serious problem that has affected farmers all over Australia. But I wonder whether that drought has adversely affected small business and farmers more than the high interest rates which the government used and continued to use and which crippled Australian business for far too long. I have always been intrigued as to how the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) could go forward and admit that he has made mistakes, admit that we have the recession we had to have, admit that he has broken the inflation stick and so forth and just go on to another subject and leave small business and farmers to grapple with the consequence of his mistakes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to address my remarks to the part of the bill which will hit small business in a very hard way&mdash;that is, the amendment relating to the provisional tax uplift factor. The rate of the uplift factor is of great importance to provisional taxpayers. It is the amount by which the previous year's income tax is raised for this year's provisional tax assessment. The government has arbitrarily decided that the going rate is eight per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a great deal of representation to the government from the small business sector for the uplift factor to be reduced to a figure that reflects the growth figure, which is around four per cent when we consider inflation and the increased cost of interest rates. The small business sector has been saying that four per cent would be an adequate figure to use to assess its future incomes. However, the government has decided that small business can once again be the sacrificial lamb and the government will use the figure of eight per cent to calculate the 1994-95 provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been pointed out on many occasions that the uplift factor of eight per cent is four per cent over growth. This will require small business to find an extra $400 million for tax payments next year. That is a very unfair element arising from the high rate of eight per cent which the government has imposed. It simply is not calculated on any justifiable figure. I know that my colleagues Senator Watson and Senator Kemp took this matter to a Senate inquiry. They could not get any justifiable reason why eight per cent was the accepted figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It represents the bringing forward of $340 million paid for by small business to help the government balance this year's deficit. The explanatory memorandum to the bill says that the:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . uplift factor reflects the effects of inflation and other relevant factors in ascertaining the amount of income subject to provisional tax.</PARA>
<PARA>The government is going around beating its chest saying that the inflation rate is down to 1.7 per cent this year, yet it goes out and charges the small business sector eight per cent. Surely there is a great difference between the present inflation rate of 1.7 per cent and the eight per cent on which the government will assess future small business tax. This is a concern because when Treasury officials were questioned at the Senate estimates hearing on how they calculated the uplift factor, they could put forward no relevant factors for the calculation. At the Senate inquiry, Senator Kemp said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have learnt from Treasury that this figure of eight per cent is a notional figure, a figure sort of plucked out of the air.</PARA>
<PARA>My colleague further noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The uplift factor going from four to eight per cent is having a major effect on the cash flow of small business, particularly in the climate where the government is very anxious to create jobs in small business.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Watson is acknowledged by all members of the Senate as one of the experts on taxation matters, and his view is that the uplift factor is too high as evidenced by the number of applications last year to reassess provisional tax. This all costs small business time and money. Many small business operators have to face the fringe benefits tax and the prescribed payments tax. Now they will have to reassess themselves on their provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To digress for a few minutes, I have been approached by builders in my home state saying that it is taking them two days a month to fill out the prescribed payments forms. These are not big, massive builders, but cottage builders. They are finding it very hard to give time to fill in these prescribed payments forms. Now they will have to reassess their provisional tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The uplift factor in provisional tax is an extra federal tax that is unfairly placed on the extra cost of small business. I was in small business for 20-odd years and many small business people tell me, `What happens now is nothing like what happened when you were in small business 12 years ago.' They tell me that they almost need an extra person to keep the books and to do the necessary paperwork in order to provide the government with information so that it can then in turn tax small business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn to a point made by the Queensland Retail Traders and Shopkeepers Association. The point the association makes is that by imposing an uplift factor at double the growth factor, the government is severely penalising all those who pay provisional tax. Unlike the PAYE and companies which pay tax on actual income earned less cost, provisional taxpayers are being forced to pay on projected turnover at double the current rate of growth. The government is plainly using small business to fund its irresponsible budget deficit. The entire Australian community is the worse off for the job opportunities that are lost in the small business sector from this extra cost burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to point out that this becomes particularly serious when viewed from the perspective of small business communities and retailers in rural areas that are affected by the drought. Queensland and New South Wales are suffering the worst drought that has been experienced in a number of years. But the National Party of Australia understands&mdash;and obviously the government does not understand&mdash;that rural communities stick together in times of adversity. They try to maintain as best they can their own business structures in their own small towns. They try to help one another, back one another up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The small business community moved in to help the farming community when many of the banks and the lending institutions wrote them off and would not extend any lending, and when the government was insisting that drought was a natural part of life. Small business and the retailing sectors came to the aid of the small business person. Consequently, many rural small businesses have debts on their books, particularly from farmers, of $150,000 to $200,000. I would say that in some cases those figures are fairly modest, but they are figures that I obtained from the Queensland retailers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the drought has lasted longer than anyone anticipated, many of these small businesses have already collapsed and more are in danger of total collapse. Small business has had its cashflow severely restricted, while at the same time small business operators have had to continue to pay their wholesalers on a seven-day account. This problem is magnified when provisional tax has to be paid and when the tax regime incorporates an unrealistically based eight per cent uplift factor on the income increase factor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the rural small business person the credit amounts are classed as sales. If one sells a product, it is classed as a sale and as profit, irrespective of the fact that one may not get paid for it for six months. The provisional tax has to be paid on sales, not on actual profit. In normal times the money will come in in 30 days and a sale gets turned into a profit. But as we used to say in small business, a sale is not a sale until one gets paid for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, in these circumstances a sale is deemed to be profit which has to have an uplift factor of eight per cent paid on it before the money comes in, and this is further affecting the small business regime in rural Australia at the moment. In these extreme circumstances the small business community is calling for consideration of its case and for means to be found to address the plight of rural small businesses caught in this horrendous drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to instance the small business scheme initiated by the Queensland government, which gives a $5,000 interest subsidy to small businesses caught in exceptional drought circumstances. I think the Queensland government is putting some $5 million into it and it is to be commended for that. I am suggesting to the government&mdash;and I hope I can have senator McMullan's attention&mdash;that it match dollar for dollar that small business initiative provided by the Queensland government. On many occasions in exceptional circumstances and at other times of need the federal government puts out some forms of money that have to be matched dollar for dollar from the states. It would be a welcome initiative if the federal government were to match the Queensland government subsidies dollar for dollar. I ask the government to consider that suggestion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought, combined with other long-term government policies, has placed a heavy threat on the survival of many rural communities. The figures are there. Last year, the drought caused a $580 million loss in gross value of production in Queensland's rural sector, with a flow-on effect of $1.4 billion. Included in these massive losses are losses burdening rural small business. I will address this matter further in my contribution to the drought debate tomorrow but, while I have Senator McMullan's ear, I would like to make sure that he picks up this matter. I call on him and the government to consider rural small business as an integral part of its response to the drought. I ask the government to match the Queensland government dollar for dollar in its small business drought interest rate subsidy scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has always believed in assisting small business as part of severe drought measures. To its shame the government, in removing drought from the natural disaster relief arrangements, has neglected to even look at the great chasm that is left for small business in times of severe drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has always called on the states to meet its rural assistance interest subsidy schemes dollar for dollar. The federal government now has the opportunity to show that it can do the same thing when the boot is on the other foot and the initiative for small business interest subsidies comes from the state government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small business is often called on to create employment, yet the government insists on creating more and more disincentives. A recent survey showed that a major disincentive for small business to take on more employees was the government's new dismissal provisions in the industrial relations legislation&mdash;the reverse onus of proof is now on the employee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other aspect of the bill that I would like to address&mdash;the reportable payments system. At this stage, a reportable payments system is being introduced for certain industries. This is an entirely new tax system which, no doubt, over time will be inflicted on many other industries. Initially, it will apply to the fishing and clothing industries only. The system commences on 1 November this year. According to the government, its purpose is to increase compliance with taxation laws by extending the use of the tax file number scheme. Before a reportable payment is made, the tax file number of the payee must be quoted. If this does not happen, tax is deducted at the 48 per cent rate for payment to the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very real concern that this system will be cost-effective for neither the government nor the fishing industry. In fact, there will be increased costs for wholesalers, associated with keeping records and complying with the system. As happens to all price takers in the fishing industry, these costs will be passed on to the producer or the fisherman, who will have to bear the extra cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will use the fishing industry as an example. For several years, the fishing industry has been scrutinised by the tax office, and tax compliance has been found to be good. Now within the industry, under the new reportable payments system, payments will have to be recorded as the product moves through each wholesaler. In reality, this could happen many times for the same fish products. A fish could move from a local wholesaler, to a Sydney wholesaler and on to an Adelaide wholesaler. The same fish may be reported six times to the tax office in Canberra. The real tax avoider in the industry is the amateur fisherman who on-sells to retailers and other outlets. They will not be caught by this new tax system. They will continue to sell their catches for cash through the black market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reportable payments system will impose extra costs on buyers, which will be passed on to producers through lower returns, while the black-market seller will continue undetected outside the tax system. These problems are also plainly there in the building industry, where the prescribed payments system is costing builders several days' paperwork a month. I will address these problems in the committee stage of the bill, when I will seek assurances from the minister that the reportable payments scheme will be assessed within a period of time and, if it is shown not to be effective, it will be removed from the industry. </PARA>

I wish to take the opportunity to place on the public record a serious concern we have regarding the interaction between this bill, the use of tax file numbers and the connection with both the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security. This is referred to in the bill, and I will come back to it in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts mentioned briefly that those who work intermittently experience the problem of continually reporting their changing circumstances to the Department of Social Security. I will speak on the difficulties that impact on social security recipients and the way in which the tax file number has become a de facto Australia Card. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government seems determined to make a mockery of its initial rhetoric about tax file numbers. When the system was introduced, we were told that no one would be compelled to provide a tax file number; it would be used only to detect tax fraud. Since then, the net has been thrown wider, and the use of tax file numbers is being justified as a means of reducing social security fraud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has now shown that its desire to extend the use of tax file numbers knows no bounds. Since the decision of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Federal Court&mdash;which all found that Mr John Malloch was not obliged to provide a tax file number under the Social Security Act&mdash;that very Social Security Act has been changed. The implications and principles underlying those decisions have been disregarded by the Department of Social Security to such an extent that more than 36,000 people have been denied social security benefits or have had them stopped. It is outrageous that the government still informed people that they were required to provide their tax file numbers even immediately after the decision in the Malloch case. That directly contradicted the Federal Court's decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I requested information&mdash;as did Senator Woodley and the honourable member for Stirling, Mr Eoin Cameron&mdash;regarding the way in which the request for tax file numbers had been used to deny benefits to people. We were astonished to receive a table from the Hon. Janice Crosio, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, which showed that 31,000 people had their payment stopped; 4,000 people had made a voluntary surrender of their tax file number; and 1,142 new claims had been refused. Overall, a total of 36,684 claims were stopped because of a refusal to provide a tax file number. This is a very disturbing trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the government's need to minimise social security fraud, but its measures to achieve this appear to be focused more on withholding benefits than on pursuing fraudulent claims. It is hardly a compelling argument to suggest that, if 36,000 people refuse to give their tax file numbers, it is an admission that the claim for a benefit was fraudulently based. It is a very novel way to approach the criminal code, and I am sure it would not be appreciated within the courts. Yet the government seems to include all such savings in its figures on fraud minimisation&mdash;further proof that it considers this is its main measure of assessing fraud. I object to it strongly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 220AF of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) states that there will be a deduction from reportable payment if a payee's tax file number is not quoted. This bill will supposedly benefit members of the community who are otherwise disadvantaged, but it is yet another subtle way of introducing a penalty if they fail to produce a tax file number. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not be canvassing a number of matters that have already been canvassed in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1994. However, I would like to say that I agree very strongly with the view that has been expressed during this debate that the government's promise prior to the last election of $30 a week for carers of children at home was and is a fraud. There is no other word that can express the widespread deception that was perpetrated on the public of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people, particularly women, were saying, `Isn't that good. I will now be truly free to choose to give up my part-time job and care full-time for my children.' There were many who wanted to give away a full-time job, cutting it down to a part-time job and access what they thought was a belated recognition of the work of parents, normally the mothers, in caring for children at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They were led to believe this because the child-care cash rebate scheme was also bandied about through the length and breadth of Australia before the same election. Now they realise that all they were getting was $2.60 a week. This bill is designed to knock off $28.40 from the pay packets of the workers of Australia. That is what this bill is all about and, in my view, that is a disgrace. The workers of Australia will soon be well aware of the subterfuge and the fraud perpetrated upon them. They will be well aware of it when, whether they be male or female workers, their pay packets are cut by $28.40 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion has been made that it was necessary for this to occur so that the carers, normally the mothers, get some of the dependent spouse rebate in their hands. Of course, many mothers are the managers of the home finances and already get the whole pay packet every week. That is generally the case. It was certainly the case in my family&mdash;I was going to say `when I was working'&mdash;before I came into this place. Has it never occurred to the government that, instead of setting up the enormous bureaucratic bungle that will take place, the simple way to do this is to ensure that when workers make out the form for a dependent spouse rebate they nominate the bank account into which it should be paid on behalf of the carer. That would be the simple thing to do and would achieve the objective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My worry&mdash;I will come back to this later&mdash;is that what will happen to this scheme is what has already happened to the family allowance payment, now called family payment. The value of that allowance has decreased substantially over the years and I am concerned that the same will happen here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But before I continue with that, I would like to refer to something that Senator Boswell mentioned in his contribution to this debate. I agree with what Senator Boswell had to say about the fishing industry: there is a problem with reportable payments. The proposal to force taxpayers to report payments by PAYE tax file number or have 48.4 per cent withheld is a potential massive extension of bureaucracy. The reason for self-assessment was to free tax officials from assessing and allow them to undertake extensive auditing. Why is it necessary to turn taxpayers into enforcement agents? I would like Senator Sherry to take this on notice so that he can answer it tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that thousands of honest people are being forced to become unpaid tax collectors. The fishing industry&mdash;an industry of central importance to Tasmania&mdash;has been targeted. I do not want to see honest, hard working people sent broke because of a requirement to handle more unpaid paperwork. As Senator Boswell said, one fish might have to be counted several times for the purposes of this particular measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants to introduce this system, it should pay a commission to business people who are being asked to collect its taxes for it. The interesting thing is that these are very practical people. They are doing often very bulky work for the people who benefit from that work&mdash;us. We are the ones who benefit from the fishing industry. They have to set aside precious time to do the work of the government and, in my view, that is not appropriate. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I would like to take this opportunity to examine Labor's neglect of Australia's greatest export industry. Tourism is probably the most competitive industry in the world today, and within this industry Australia has a lot of talented players, with dynamic entrepreneurs and unparalleled natural assets. However, it should be kept in perspective. I refer the chamber to the annual report of the Department of Tourism, where it is pointed out that, even though tourism is awfully important to this country, from the point of view of the share of the world tourism market, Australia gets 0.6 per cent of world tourists into Australia. So there is an enormous potential out there to increase that potential, and the result would be a positive effect in regard to our balance of payments and, of course, the unconscionable level of foreign debt that we have in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the Labor government, through its ignorance, has embarked on a campaign, subtle though it is, to actually suck revenue out of the industry and damage its viability in the world markets. If we are to retain even the relatively small percentage we have and increase it, we must be competitive throughout the world. Currently, there is no doubt, this is an attractive country to visit, but the important thing is to keep it that way. I do not care whether we are talking about social, environmental or other matters, but certainly from an economic view it must continue to be attractive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To start with, the most important impediment to the industry, the one that is the greatest disincentive to the industry, is the Industrial Relations Act. When one talks to potential tourist operators, whether it be on the Gold Coast, Cairns, the northern parts of New South Wales or anywhere in the country, they all indicate that it is a great disincentive to investment&mdash;and, of course, without investment we are not going to have the facilities to attract the tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The act was absurdly suggested to be micro-economic reform, whereas, in fact, it made the workplace inflexible and less productive. One of the great disincentives, even though, on the face of it, it appeared to have some merit, is the so-called unfair dismissals provision. It means that potential legal liability for employers is such that they resist the temptation, which they would like to succumb to, to put people on the full-time work force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the other monster created by the Labor Party, that is, the quite complex fringe benefits tax and some of the silly things that have come with it. The main purpose for the introduction of the fringe benefits tax&mdash;this was the story told by the government at the time&mdash;was to get people to cash out the so-called benefits that were being given to people who were abusing the system. It has gone a lot further than that, and in this financial year alone the fringe benefits tax will bring in $3.2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself is bad enough for all industry, but I think the worst part of it, by a long shot, is the complexity of it and having to account for it. For example, it might sound ludicrous, but it is the case that, if people use their mobile telephones in their office, which they would not do, it is okay; but if they use them outside the office, they have to account for them or pay fringe benefits tax. Anyone in this place with a mobile phone would know that that is one of the most ludicrous things one could possibly imagine. So that has to be addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also the idea, which Labor politicians keep putting forward from time to time for an industry that is really growing, that there should be additional taxes. This is a government of high taxes; it is a government that hits industries when they can least afford it. The Labor member for Lilley, Mr Wayne Swan, has been saying that there should be the introduction of a bed tax. I quote him:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New taxes on hotel rooms and restaurants would be consistent with our philosophy of a progressive approach to taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the industry should be put on notice that that is the hidden agenda of the government and that it is only a matter of time before these additional taxes are imposed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add a few comments on the 1993-94 annual report of the Department of Tourism. In a number of ways this is actually a welcome report. Tourism is one of the few industries where the government is apparently adopting a strategic approach. There is a national tourism strategy in place, and there is targeted government support to achieve the objectives of that program. This is something that the Australian Democrats have been pushing for in terms of targeted strategic sector by sector industry plans, and tourism is one of the areas where the government has adopted, or appears to have adopted, that attitude.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be some recognition that tourism is a major potential employer and that, since market forces are not clearing our dole queues, there is a need for government programs to develop a major new employing industry. There is, of course, some concern that many of the jobs that are created in the tourism industry are jobs which are not well paid and do not have a career structure, but as time goes on, it is to be hoped, we will rectify that. The increased number of programs and the funding for these programs as detailed in the report are certainly welcome, and I hope that the government will maintain its commitment to these programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I should say, though, by way of criticism of this report, that much of the material that is offered in the performance overview sections tends to be a discussion of what has been done in a descriptive way without detailing the actual impact of the programs; and that is possibly something that could be addressed in a future report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other criticism relates to a comment which is out of step with the government's apparent commitment to the industry. Why did the government discriminate against single-service tourism operators in its May white paper, allowing only 25 per cent of eligible expenditure to be claimed under the export market development grants program as against the 50 per cent which is available to all other industries?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourism generates business not only for the firms undertaking the promotion but also for other Australian companies. That would suggest to me that it deserves more, rather than less, support than other industries.

I must say that there is not much this government does that I agree with, but I think that it is heading in the right direction with the program it has on some support and assistance for development and for development strategies for tourism in regional Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice that Mr Lee in the other place mentioned me and compared me with Mr Ted Lindsay, the honourable member for Herbert, in raising awareness of this, but of course Mr Lindsay is seen as a fairly ineffectual member. It was, I thought, part of my role as the coalition spokesman on regional matters to draw to the attention of regional councils, regional tourist organisations and regional development boards the availability of these government funds. It is not 100 per cent perfect&mdash;nothing this government does is&mdash;but it is a step in the right direction and whilst the money is available, I am very happy to raise the awareness of the program in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report indicates that there is $23 million available for this program over a four-year period to assist regional areas to develop opportunities that will increase their capacity to draw both domestic and international tourists. Funding is being provided for initiatives that will generate long-term economic employment, provide sustainable tourism growth through responsible planning and management, diversify the tourism product base, raise tourism industry standards and, to a limited extent, provide tourism infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This program, whilst heading in the right direction, did have a noticeable flaw, and that is that there was no cooperation, contact or discussion with state governments, some of whom were doing the same sorts of things. It is a pity that the Federal government cannot manage itself properly to coordinate its programs with programs existing in various of the state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department's reporting in this paper of a $4 million rural tourism program over four years again is a step in the right direction. But it seems that the question must be asked why that amount of money is being made available for rural tourism programs when five million Australians, that is one in three, live in rural and regional areas. It is interesting to note in passing that ATSIC received more than that&mdash;that is, $5 million&mdash;for the promotion of tourism in Aboriginal and Islander areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the brief time that I have had to look at this report I note that the Cape York Peninsula Development Association was the recipient of $68,000 to develop a plan to ensure tourist access to this wilderness area is economically, environmentally and socially sustainable. That is an area which I think will benefit from some planning. One of the things that is desperately needed there is toilet facilities along the road from Cooktown to the Cape. There are a lot of complaints that there are no facilities available. At many times of the year that trail looks like one long string of toilet paper because there are no facilities available. </PARA>

In the time that I have had available to look at it, which has not been long, I have been struck by the significant increase in overseas visitor arrivals from just under one million in 1983 when this government took office to three million visitors last year. Senator Ian Macdonald has, a little reluctantly, acknowledged the contribution of this government in the success of these visitor arrivals from overseas. If we look at the comparative export earnings for tourism, vis a vis the other industry sectors in Australia, we see that tourism has gone from a little over $2 1/4 billion to well over $10 billion in 1993-94, in fact surpassing industries such as coal, manufacturers, gold, wool, wheat and transport equipment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue of interest, although I do not think it is detailed here, has been the shift in tourism from the European region to the Asian region, and particularly the make-up of people within the Asian region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Development Authority is charged mainly with two tasks.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TCFDA administers the industry's development strategy, which comprises four programs. The first is incentives for international competitiveness by way of adjustment grants; and $87 million has been committed since 1988-89, according to the report. The program was closed on 4 October 1993 for a very bizarre reason, that `requests for assistance far outweighed the remaining funds'. It seems odd that if we are trying to assist an industry to change&mdash;and there is evidence of that with the many applications on the table before government&mdash;we throw our towel in and say, `There is just too much to be done. We will not do anything'. I will return to that point a little later. The second is the further wool processing program and $40 million has been committed to that. The third is the infrastructure support program and capitalisation grants program, at a cost of $159 million; and, fourthly, the imports credit scheme, with $212 million in credits over the past three years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mostly, this report presents the changes in the TCF industry as a success story, noting recent impressive increases in exports, production and profitability. It is certainly true that the industry has restructured, moving away from high-volume mass production, where it cannot compete with low-wage countries, and moving more into high value-added areas. That is to be commended. However, two points need to be made. The social cost of this transition has been enormous. Despite the improved performance of the industry over the last couple of years, the industry employs some 30,000 fewer people than it did prior to the decision to cut protection. The impact on local communities in places like Ararat where major plants&mdash;the lifeblood of the town&mdash;have closed down has been disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The costs in general terms, both the direct social security cost and the social impact, have been horrendous. The change has been and continues to be major. But why the hurry? Why does it have to be done so fast that we cannot keep pace with the social change, the retraining and the development of alternatives that need to happen? Table 2.1 in the report shows the phase-out of bounty arrangements for the TCF industry from rates of 22 per cent to zero in just two years. Changes can certainly be made and industries could be made more efficient, without damage to people's lives, if the government were to take into account a more reasonable time scale and do so gradually. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The haste and pressure that have been exercised on the industry have led to the development of sweatshop industries, backyarders and subcontractors who work for a pittance. I believe that is an extremely unhealthy development. It has been well and truly documented, not least by a series of articles in the Melbourne <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> by Mr Heinrich. The point of these arguments is that further transitory finance support from the government must be provided.

But all anyone has to do is to walk into virtually any clothing shop to see the truth. Page 15 of the report shows that exports have increased by about $200 million, but the column above says that imports have increased by $500 million. That is an addition of $300 million to our trade deficit. This is the policy that we are introducing, supposedly to make things better for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have virtually ceased producing for our own needs. Investment figures, which are also shown in this document, do not relate to domestic employment, but to exporting jobs in other countries. Virtually all the clothes and cloth is produced overseas, mainly in China. Cloth from China is also priced at a level where it is often cheaper to buy finished clothes than to buy the cloth to make them at home. What is produced here is often made in sweatshops. As Senator Spindler quite rightly said, there are sweatshops in Victoria in 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This brings us to another problem. It is not the final customers who make the market choices; it is the wholesalers and distributors. For them, it makes sense to get track shoes made in Indonesia or wherever, with labour costs of a dollar or two. This is much cheaper than buying them from the United States or in Australia. There is a cost saving, but it does not make sense for them to pass those savings on to customers. The distributors have been making incredible market pushes for Nike, Adidas and other shoes. The distributors and retailers can also control the availability of alternatives&mdash;and the perception of the quality of these alternatives. So those same shoes made in Indonesia are sold for $100, $120 or $150. Even if a company can make a product whose final price is competitive with imports, it will not be competitive with the final profit margin made by the manufacturer, distributor or retailer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not help the developing nations. If we look particularly at the TCF industry overseas, we see it as one of the areas where worker conditions are the worst. Frequently, the companies involved in underpaying workers are TCF companies. Underpaying in Indonesia means paying workers less than $1 per day, rather than the minimum wage of $1.80. In Thailand, it means paying two or three dollars, instead of the minimum wage of $5 per day. The average Chinese factory worker gets $39 a month. The disparity between rich and poor in developing countries is huge&mdash;and growing. The argument of competitiveness is used in all these countries to keep wages down, when any argument is offered at will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer, Mr Willis, said last week in Madrid at the IMF meeting that no measures should be taken to integrate environmental or labour standards into trade. The managing director of the IMF was even more honest about the economic agenda, saying that the IMF believes any minimum wage levels anywhere, as well as unemployment benefits or any restriction on the ability of companies to sack workers when they wish, is an impediment to global growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, workers in developing nations will be more and more intensely exploited for the benefit of the rich in their own nations and elsewhere. The result will be a situation where every nation will be under pressure to reduce its own standards and protective measures, or be marginalised economically. It is true that high tariffs cannot work. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak about an aircraft accident which occurred at Edinburgh RAAF base in 1990. An air force pilot was killed in this accident when the tail of his Nomad fell off. As a result of that accident, the exchange between ministers as to the reasons for the crash and other matters which I do not wish to go into tonight, the ombudsman was asked to investigate the adequacy of the RAAF response to that loss of a Nomad A18401.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ombudsman has gone through a fairly long process of inquiry and produced a draft report, which was sent out to all parties for comment, as is the requirement under section 15 of the Ombudsman Act 1976. The final report has been completed and is now available. It makes a number of trenchant comments about a number of government instrumentalities. The ombudsman says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All submissions received were carefully considered in preparation of the Ombudsman's final report.</PARA>
<PARA>The ombudsman continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RAAF's investigation was conducted well and identified many deficiencies. The RAAF found that the tailplane of the aircraft had disintegrated in flight because of existing cracking, which would have been discovered had an acceptance servicing on delivery to ARDU been carried out in August 1989. The cracking would also have been discovered had ARDU carried out an Anti-Deterioration Servicing, due no later than 6 March 1990&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which would have been just before the accident occurred. The ombudsman also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the RAAF did not go far enough to attribute individual responsibility for the deficiencies found and gave inadequate consideration to the question of disciplinary action.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that later. The ombudsman acknowledged:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The RAAF did not attempt any `cover up' of any issue relating to or flowing from the crash.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to the Government Aircraft Factory, the ombudsman found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The GAF's design of the tailplane was defective. The tailplane failed to meet Australian Civil Certification standards. The defect was known to GAF as early as 1981-82 . . . GAF failed in its responsibility to adequately advise the RAAF, Defence and the CAA of the extent of the problem and remedial action necessary to bring the aircraft back to certification standard. In fact, the GAF appears to have deliberately withheld information in order to obscure the extent of the problem.</PARA>
<PARA>The ombudsman also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GAF also failed to substantiate its hypotheses about the causes and growth of cracking or to undertake fatigue analysis of the tailplane . . . GAF continued to advertise the Nomad as having a fatigue life in excess of 30,000 hours&mdash;when in fact no fatigue life for the tailplane had been established.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to AeroSpace Technologies of Australia Pty Ltd, the ombudsman found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASTA did not maintain Nomad A18-401 in an airworthy state in accordance with the terms of its loan contract with the RAAF . . . ASTA failed to recognise the servicing required at the end of its program of running the aircraft's engines while on the ground . . . ASTA failed to prepare a Condition Acceptance Report at the expiry of the loan . . . ASTA's . . . failure to substantiate its understanding of the causes of the cracking significantly increased the final cost to the Commonwealth for its remedy&mdash;now estimated by the Department of Defence to be in excess of $6,000,000 . . . ASTA failed to respond to the airworthiness issues set out in letters from the CAA in June 1989 concerning the origins and nature of the tailplane cracking.</PARA>
<PARA>The ombudsman also gives ASTA the credit for pursuing the causes of tailplane cracking since the crash and designing and installing modifications to resolve the problem. The Civil Aviation Authority was the next government instrumentality to come under the microscope. The ombudsman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite a decade of unsuccessful modifications carried out by the manufacturer (GAF), the CAA failed to obtain from ASTA a full explanation of ASTA's understanding of the causes of cracking . . . The CAA, having received a Major Defect Report on a Nomad aircraft nine months before the crash of A18-401, failed to take proper and responsible action to obtain answers from ASTA. As a result of this failure it was in no position to act to maintain Nomad air safety and in consequence precluded itself from preventing the loss of A18-401 . . . Since the crash, the CAA has actively pursued its responsibilities, to ensure that ASTA understands the problem . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned particularly about the sheeting home of responsibility to individuals. I am also concerned that this report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman: Investigation into adequacy of RAAF response to loss of Nomad A18-401</EMPHASIS> has not been tabled. I seek leave to table this report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been drawn to my attention that, because of the long delays since this accident, the family of the deceased pilot is now precluded from having the satisfaction of seeing Defence Force personnel who may well be guilty of negligence and certainly have been severely criticised in the ombudsman's report brought to justice. I am told by the ombudsman that the reason for this is that under the Defence Force Discipline Act there is a statutory bar after three years for disciplinary action. I question whether the common law does not prevail, so that people who may be guilty of manslaughter can still be charged with a serious offence, which appears to be the case here. That is a matter which deserves further investigation. I am not entirely satisfied with the answers given by the RAAF in the ombudsman's draft report, but he has reported them in his final report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned that it has taken so long for this report to be tabled. On 27 June this year Mr Bill Taylor, in the other place, made a short speech saying he expected the report to be tabled within a week. Of course, it was not. Mr Peter Reith, the then shadow minister for defence, on 30 August wrote to Minister Ray saying he had received representations from the family of Flight Lieutenant Glenn Donovan seeking to have the report by the Commonwealth and Defence Force Ombudsman on this matter tabled in the parliament and that the family believed that this would be appropriate recognition of the significance of the report and its findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the requests seemed reasonable, Mr Reith asked Senator Ray to give favourable consideration to tabling the report. We are now in October and there is still no sign from the government that it is prepared to table this important report. So I have taken the action which I have tonight to make the Senate aware of this damning report of a number of government agencies, of the vulnerability of pilots in Australia who are flying Nomad aircraft and of the failure by the people who are responsible for maintaining Nomad aircraft, particularly air force Nomads, which lead to this loss of life. I understand that some Nomads at the Oakey school of military aviation have just recently been grounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a serious matter which deserves the attention of the Senate. I hope that we can produce a reference for the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade so that it can take up the findings and recommendations of this report, the reason for the government's failure to table it and also the legal question relating to holding people accountable where they have been negligent in the pursuit of their duties. Action may well be available to be taken against people in ASTA or the CAA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As shadow minister for defence, I certainly want to see that any airmen in this country, who are already engaged in a dangerous occupation, have in place every safety protection available to them. I do not expect servicemen or civilians servicing aircraft to be negligent in their duties. I am sure that the Senate would agree with me on that. I commend this report to the Senate and ask for the issues I have outlined to be investigated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I want to pay tribute to Mr Brian Mulherin, a great Queenslander and Australian, who died suddenly on 29 July 1994. I know the Leader of the Australian Democrats, Senator Kernot, would want to be associated with this tribute as well. Brian Mulherin was President of the Brisbane South branch of the Association of Independent Retirees. Indeed, he helped to establish the Brisbane South branch of the association in 1992 and was the founding president of that branch as well as the driving force both of the branch and of the association in Queensland. He was serving as Vice-President of the Queensland division of the Association of Independent Retirees and was about to assume the role of Queensland president at the time of his death.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After travelling and working overseas in his younger days, Brian Mulherin spent most of his working life in the oil industry. He started working in the industry in Mackay and worked throughout Queensland and New South Wales. He was a passionate follower of the sport of rugby union and was on the formation committee to establish Ballymore, Brisbane's famous home of rugby union. He also worked in senior roles for many years for the Souths rugby club and would no doubt have been pleased to see the great success which that club has achieved in recent years, especially as the club spent many years as battlers in the Brisbane rugby competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my own experiences with Brian Mulherin, it was always very clear that he had a strong and enthusiastic commitment to the cause of independent retirees and their struggle to prevent being forgotten and overlooked by governments throughout Australia. Indeed, he played a part in making the AIR one of the most effective lobby groups that I have dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prior to his death, Brian Mulherin was working on achieving an organisational restructuring of the Association of Independent Retirees to enhance its effectiveness and to strengthen its organisation. I know his contribution has been highly valued by the association. I always found him to be very helpful and open in my dealings with him. I recall a very lively forum which he chaired during the election campaign last year. It was a forum in which Senator Alston, Minister Con Sciacca and I debated a number of issues. It was a pretty lively forum but he was a very able chair. I remember at the end of the forum as he was thanking the three of us for speaking that he predicted that either Senator Alston or Con Sciacca would be a minister and that I would be elected. With a record like that, he might have missed his calling as a political analyst. He was certainly doing better than many of the other analysts. Anyway, that is one memory which I have of his ability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The enormous amount of voluntary work done by Brian Mulherin in so many aspects of the community is a prime example of the unsung but crucial contribution made by people in a voluntary capacity throughout Australia. It is important that the value of such work is recognised by society, by government and, I trust, by the Senate. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I extend my sympathies to Mr Mulherin's wife and two children. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the paper says and that is exactly what the Public Works Committee said back in 1992 when the then deputy chair of the committee, Bill Taylor, Bruce Scott and I put in a dissenting report to the committee report that approved the construction of this extravagant building.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government is so inept that it is building this huge edifice at a cost of $165 million. Back then, we made the point that there were cheaper and better options. In fact, in our dissenting report we talked about refurbishing and adding to the existing building. We stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This option would supply an extra 14,000 square metres and an additional 240 car parking spaces. At an estimated cost of only $102m . . .</PARA>
<PARA>We are going to end up with a building that has cost $165 million plus a refurbishment of the old DFAT building which will have to be used to take up the slack of this huge government department at a cost of at least another $80 million&mdash;all because our foreign minister wants something built in his memory next to Parliament House. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time, the conscience of the Labor Party, former Senator Peter Walsh, was absolutely adamant that that building should not be proceeded with. He lobbied me; he lobbied the Public Works Committee. A majority of members of the Public Works Committee, including Labor Party members, after they had seen the figures, the proposal and the gross extravagance of this building, were going to vote against it. But at the end of the day, the old Labor Party mates trick worked. They were squeezed, they were pushed, they were shoved. One of the members did not turn up for the vote and the other one reluctantly supported the government, under threat. So this controversial project&mdash;</PARA>

We made the point in our dissenting report to the Public Works Committee report that this huge building would provide no extra space than what was already available in the old building. The alternative that we put forward, and which was put forward to the Public Works Committee in 1985 and approved, was overridden by the government, all at the whim of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA></TALK.START>
