<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances Statement on work of Committee during Autumn and Winter Sittings 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Overview</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the present sittings the Committee scrutinised the usual large number of disallowable legislative instruments tabled in the Senate, made under the authority of scores of parent Acts administered through virtually every Department of State. Almost every legislative scheme relies on delegated legislation to provide the administrative details of programs set out in broad policy in parent Acts which authorise such delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee acts on behalf of the Senate to scrutinise each of these instruments to ensure that they conform to the high standards of parliamentary propriety and personal liberties which the Senate applies to Acts. If the Committee detects any breach of these standards it writes to the Minister or other law-maker in respect of the apparent defect, asking that the instrument be amended or an explanation provided. If the breach appears serious then the Chairman of the Committee gives notice of a motion of disallowance in respect of the instrument. This allows the Senate, if it wishes, to disallow the instrument. This ultimate step is rarely necessary, however, as Ministers almost invariably take action which satisfies the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, by the end of the sittings Ministers  have given the Committee undertakings to amend many provisions in different instruments or parent Acts to meet its concerns, reflecting a continuing high level of cooperation from Ministers in its non-partisan operations. The Committee is grateful for this cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee scrutinised 826 instruments, which is an historic high.  Of these, 237 were statutory rules, which are generally better drafted and presented than other series of delegated legislation. The other 589 instruments were the usual heterogeneous collection of different series.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Each of the 826 instruments were scrutinised by the Committee under its four principles, or terms of reference, which are included in the Standing Orders. There were 97 prima facie defects or matters worthy of comment in those 826 instruments. The defects are described below under each of the four principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (a)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Is delegated legislation in accordance with the statute?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This principle is interpreted broadly by the Committee to include not only technical invalidity, but also every other aspect of parliamentary propriety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nevertheless, detection of technical validity is an important part of the work of the Committee. As usual, a number of instruments may have invalidly subdelegated legislative powers. Several apparently invalid subdelegations were to statutory authorities, another was to the Minister, another to the Minister on the recommendation of agencies and another to the Secretary of the Department. One instrument may have been invalid because it purported to incorporate foreign laws, another because it incorporated international treaties which could be amended from time to time and another because it appeared to incorporate administrative actions. Another instrument purported invalidly to exclude the application of a provision of an Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other instruments did not operate validly as intended. One amending instrument appeared to amend the wrong instrument. Another did not actually effect its obvious intent to revoke an earlier instrument. The Explanatory Statement for another advised that its intended date of operation was different from the date provided in the instrument. The Explanatory Statement for another did not confirm that detailed mandatory procedures, required before making, had been met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The drafting of delegated legislation should be of a standard equal to that of Acts. During the present sittings one instrument did not indicate the date on which it was made. Numbers of other instruments included wrong references and cross-references, numbering and citation errors, reference errors in Notes to provisions, inconsistencies and misprints. Several instruments were drafted without a citation or numbering. In two cases different agencies produced two separate instruments made under the same Act with the same numbering. One instrument referred to a statutory office abolished nine years ago. Another did not define terms which are different in each State and territory. Another used the expressions "he" and "him", rather than the more usual "he or she" and "him or her". Several instruments included undefined, uncertain and subjective expressions, such as "public disrepute", "misleading" and "seriously disruptive".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Every instrument should be accompanied by full and detailed explanatory material. Some instruments had no explanatory material at all, while other material was inadequate. Several Explanatory Statements had wrong references to statutory powers under which the instrument was made. A substituted version of an instrument did not explain why it was substituted. In several cases instruments which implemented undertakings given to the Committee did not indicate this in the Explanatory Statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that delegated legislation which operates to prejudice a person retrospectively is void. Even where retrospectivity is valid, however, the Committee will ask for reasons for long periods of unexplained retrospectivity. Several instruments were expressed to operate two years before making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee always questions provisions which may give excessive power to public officials. In one case an instrument was to commence upon proclamation, with no provision for automatic commencement if not proclaimed within six months. Another instrument conferred important powers on authorised persons, with no restrictions at all on persons who could be authorised. Another provided that significant powers could be delegated to any person at all. In another case, the Minister could make important guidelines, which appeared to be legislative in nature, which were not subject to disallowance or even to tabling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (b)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee interprets this principle broadly, to include every aspect of personal rights. During the present sittings the Committee detected the following apparent defects in delegated legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Provisions of delegated legislation should not operate harshly or unfairly. In one case an instrument removed the protection of the Child Abduction Convention from the territory of the former Yugoslavia, but replaced it with fresh provisions which covered only part of that territory. The Committee's scrutiny of this instrument was the subject of its Ninety-Eighth Report. Another instrument included a provision which may have been impossible to apply. In another case people were given an unreasonably short time in which to respond to demands from a public official. One instrument included a strict liability offence. Another required people to incriminate themselves. In another case provisions for the conduct of a ballot may have operated unfairly. Another instrument did not provide for recovery of money paid as security although an earlier instrument included such a provision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement which accompanies an instrument should always explain fully any changes in the level of taxes, charges, fees and allowances. It is a breach of personal rights as well as a breach of parliamentary proprieties if changes are so large or unexpected that they may operate unreasonably. In one case the monetary penalty for a number of offences was increased ten times. In another the formula for calculating the increases was given, but not the reasons for determining the formula. In another the expected increase in receipts was given but not the reasons for the increase. In another case substantial fees were halved with no explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee carefully scrutinises the effect of provisions in delegated legislation. In one case an instrument adapted provisions of the Crimes Act 1914 which related to pardons, quashed convictions and spent convictions and which were intended to operate to the benefit of people who had been convicted of offences. The instrument expressly used the provisions, however, to prejudice people. Retrospective delegated legislation which operates prejudicially is void under the Acts Interpretation Act. The Committees raised with Ministers a number of provisions which appeared to be void for this reason. In one case an instrument implementing an earlier undertaking to the Committee operated retrospectively to assist individuals. The instrument appeared to be void, however, because it operated to the detriment of funds which were required to pay money to the individuals. The Acts Interpretation Act actually provides that the relevant date for retrospectivity is the date of gazettal, not the date of making. In one case an instrument was made and expressed to come into effect on the same day. The instrument was not gazetted, however, until more than five weeks later and was therefore void because its provisions were prejudicial.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (c)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation make rights unduly dependent on administrative decisions which are not subject to independent review of their merits?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many instruments of delegated legislation provide for Ministers, statutory office holders and other public officials to exercise discretions. The committee believes that such discretions should be as narrow as possible, include objective criteria to limit and guide their exercise, and include review of the merits of decisions by an external, independent tribunal, which would normally be the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some cases instruments were drafted in such a way that they could operate only if a discretion was exercised, but there was no formal provision for this or of any right of review. On the other hand, the Explanatory Statement for another instrument advised of the existence of AAT review of discretions although this was not reflected in the instrument itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Numbers of discretions concerning personal rights did not appear to be subject to review, such as discretions to recognise overseas trade qualifications. Other instruments provided for review of some decisions which appeared less important than others for which review was not provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is particularly concerned about discretions to waive or reduce fees and charges. One instrument conferred discretions to extend the time for payment of a fee, to allow payment of fees by instalment and to cut off services for unpaid fees. Another gave a discretion to remit charges and another to waive fees. There was no indication that these discretions were subject to review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings many instruments dealt with public and private sector superannuation. These included numbers of important discretions. For instance, those concerning public sector superannuation included discretions on levels of salary, payment of premiums, involuntary retirement, payment of lump sums and whether there was a significant and sustained improvement in the invalidity retirement rate. Those concerning private sector superannuation included discretions on whether a person was suffering financial hardship and on the payment of lump sums to relieve hardship.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As usual, the Committee takes into account whether a decision maker may delegate his or her decision making powers. There is a stronger case for merits review where powers may be delegated, particularly where powers may be delegated to wide classes of people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Principle (d)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Does delegated legislation contain matter more appropriate for parliamentary enactment?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not raise this principle as often as its other three principles. Nevertheless, it is a principle which goes to the heart of parliamentary propriety and complements the first principle, that an instrument should be in accordance with the statute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Charter of the United Nations Amendment Act 1993, which provided for Australia to impose United Nations sanctions by regulation, relied substantially on the Ninety-Third Report of the Committee, which concluded that it was appropriate for delegated legislation to be used in this way. Following that Act, numbers of instruments have imposed sanctions, most recently, during this sittings, on Angola and Haiti.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Other developments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 24 February 1994 Senator Gibson resigned from the Committee and was replaced by Senator Abetz, appointed on 24 February 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the sittings the Committee tabled its Ninety-Eighth Report, on Scrutiny by the Committee of Amendments of the Family Law (Child Abduction Convention) Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chairman, on behalf of the Committee, made special statements to the Senate on the Territory of Christmas Island Casino Control Ordinance and on tabling requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's independent Legal Adviser since 1982, Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan, was made a Member of the Order of Australia in the Australia Day 1994 honours list, for service to the law and to Parliament, particularly as a parliamentary legal adviser. This was an honour not only for Professor Whalan, but also for the Committee and the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Deputy Clerk of the Senate and the Committee secretary wrote an article on commencement of Acts by proclamation which was accepted for publication in the July 1994 issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Parliamentarian</EMPHASIS> journal. An advance copy of the article was reviewed in several publications, including the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> magazine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The staff of the Committee visited the Joint Legislative Review Committee of the Parliament of South Australia and the staff of the Legislative Council.</PARA>

However, the regulations as originally drafted, to which Senator Bell and the opposition were going to object, made provision for the notification to be forwarded to trade unions, contrary to the intent of the legislation passed through this Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the underpinning rationale of the government's recent white paper&mdash;"working nation" that the youth of Australia should be in either school, training or in employment, many rural youth are excluded from one or more of these options in a way that is unfair and inequitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly education&mdash;there are countless numbers of eligible students who cannot afford to continue their education as a result of their family's essential farm assets disqualifying them from Austudy assets test, despite their having a low income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently students cannot be assessed for Austudy independently of their parents until the age of 23.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Are these rural students expected to wait six or seven years before completing their educations?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly jobs and training&mdash;as we all know, employment prospects for young people in rural centres are bleak.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For rural students denied the opportunity to finish their schooling, there is little hope for them to be found in the jobs compact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 96,000 Jobstart, wage-subsidised placements during 1993-94, were mainly sourced from the retail, manufacturing, entertainment/restaurants, construction and wholesale trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the vast bulk of these jobs will be found in the capital cities, particularly Sydney and Melbourne.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's commitment of $50 million to regional policy will go nowhere in creating anything like the job opportunities  that will be found in the capital cities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new youth training allowance for under eighteens is subject to the same means test as Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unless these children move away from home and declare themselves independent of their parents, the same number of young people who currently cannot access Austudy, cannot access the youth training allowance, except for the minimum, non means-tested payment of $30 a week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unable to afford to continue their educations, unable to get a job, unable to access the youth training allowance, except for the minimum payment, countless number of rural youth are essentially cast aside by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why are the dependents of the vital wealth-creating primary industries sector treated with such callous disregard?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia today is a divided county. The gulf in employment, essential services, prospects and lifestyle between metropolitan and rural and regional Australia is widening with each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural youth are particularly hard-hit. One third of under twenty five year olds are unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only way they will ever gain employment when economic conditions improve is if they are sufficiently skilled to meet the skill levels demanded by employers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We need a trained, highly-skilled workforce and the best way to achieve this is through assisting able students to complete their secondary and tertiary educations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is an absolutely lamentable situation that able students have been denied the right to pursue tertiary studies at university or tafe, because their parents farm assets disqualifies them from receiving Austudy payments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the most inequitable situations that exists in Australian society today is that of students from low-income farm families who are prevented from participating in further education, as a result of being denied Austudy assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a Department of Employment, Education and Training brochure states, without financial assistance, thousands of students would be unable to complete their educations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is certainly the case of many farm families who have been consistently denied Austudy eligibility due to holding farm assets over the assets threshold, despite having low or zero incomes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The notion that because a farmer owns a property valued at over $734,000, the current Austudy limit, that he can afford to educate his children, in many cases can not be validated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A farm and farm-related assets cannot be realised easily.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are still in the midst of a rural recession and the effects are felt nation-wide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A third of Queensland and New South Wales is officially drought-declared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent ABARE farm survey report reveals that average broadacre farm profits have been negative for the fourth consecutive year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This represents the average&mdash;many farms would have experienced negative profits for far longer than 4 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool growers have been struggling on under low prices for several years now.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The special circumstances that affect rural families, such as prolonged drought and low wool prices must be acknowledged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Children from struggling farm families should not be denied an opportunity to further their education because of the family farm.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recently prepared NFF submission contains DEET estimates that rural people's participation in higher education is only two thirds the rate of people in urban areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Data collected by DEET shows that in 1993 there were 450,000 austudy applicants. 506 Applications were refused on failure of the assets test. 48% Of these were rural applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The coalition recently moved an amendment to the Students Assistance Amendment Bill which would act to exempt students holding healthcare cards from the Austudy assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Student assistance should be based on evident need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When families qualify for a healthcare card issued by the Department of Social Security, they are subsisting on a very low income and clearly are in evident need.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A family's income stream is a far more accurate representation of  their financial circumstances than an assets test.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the income stream that provides, or in many cases for rural families is not able to provide, food, fuel, textbooks, school uniforms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not ageing farm machinery, tractors or land which often could not be sold at any price.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These assets which are essential to run the farm are clearly not assets in the way investment property, holiday houses, cars and boats are assets and should not be dealt with in the same manner when assessing Austudy eligibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our amendment was also designed to hold the government accountable to its 1993 budget commitment stated in several Department of Employment, Education and Training publications including the Austudy application form and guide and the Austudy guide to student finance&mdash;that all healthcare card holders would have the Austudy assets test waived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As is well known by now the government broke this commitment earlier this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In doing so it turned its back on the plight of rural youth from battling farm families in an utterly unconscionable manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It smashed the educational aspirations of hundreds of students that had been built up through this budget promise and does not seem to care.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recently the coalition pressed this amendment again and the bill has once again been returned to the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now up to the government to salvage the critical situation it created through the revocation of its budget promise and support our amendment when the Student Assistance Bill is dealt with again in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NFF submission is a moving testament to the shattered hopes, and wasted talents of hundreds of rural students, cruelly denied the opportunity to further their education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wasted talents of these young people is tragic and cannot be overstated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To cite just a couple of cases&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consider the case of a 20 year old student from Roma with a tertiary entrance score of 925 which would qualify her for many university courses, but who is unable to attend university because of ineligibility for Austudy and her parents cannot afford to support her.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her ambitions shattered&mdash;she is on unemployment benefits and works casually as a ringer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another student from Goondiwindi who failed to meet the austudy assets test and whose family cannot afford to support her, is forced to remain at home, unemployed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is the case of a student from Jandowe who is receiving Austudy, with the assets test waived, courtesy of the healthcare card.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This payment will cut out at the end of the month, and while her parents will be able to support her for the rest of the year, they will not be able to extend financial support for the remainder of her 3 year course.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Her future at this stage seems very uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another student from Bundaberg commenced a computer course at Bundaberg TAFE with money he had saved and with the anticipation of receiving Austudy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was refused Austudy due to his family's farm assets so had to pull out of the course, return home and apply for unemployment benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And yet another student from Theodore was denied Austudy due to the assets test, despite the family qualifying for a healthcare card. Their only solution was to retrench a station hand in order to be able to send her to university.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could relate many more such stories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The specific circumstances may differ for each family, but the thwarted ambition of these young people can be evidenced in every case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These young people are our future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Their parents produce much of this nations's wealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These youngsters desperately want to make a contribution to the nation themselves, but because of their family's specific circumstances, are denied the opportunity to do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead they are cast on the scrapheap, forced to languish on the dole when they could be finishing their educations and furthering their skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is a problem that this government must address and has the opportunity to do so through supporting the coalition's amendment to the Students Assistance Amendment Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The cost of providing Austudy payments to able students currently denied assistance is one that I believe this country should be able to afford.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wasted talents, shattered hopes and thwarted ambitions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">of countless rural students is too high a price to pay&mdash;for the students themselves and the country at large.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to do what has never been done before in this country&mdash;establish a high level public inquiry into the security challenges facing Australia, and how they might best be met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The impetus for this legislation is a growing concern felt by many Australians that the resources now being devoted to national security are misdirected. In other words, that some forms of threat are attracting resources out of proportion to their severity, while more serious security challenges are not being adequately addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The suggestion for this bill came, in the first instance, from a network of analysts who comprise the Secure Australia Project. When the Project launched its book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Threats without Enemies</EMPHASIS> in October 1992, it also released a Call for an Inquiry into Australia's Security which attracted the support of such prominent Australians as Sir Mark Oliphant, Sister Veronica Brady and Peter Garrett. The essence of the Call for an Inquiry has been incorporated into this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not that long ago that national security was defined exclusively in military terms&mdash;the protection of national borders by permanent armed forces.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These days, there is a growing recognition that the security of nations is threatened by a range of non-military phenomena&mdash;economic decline, environmental degradation, political instability, and so on. For many nations, a reasonable scale of severity would have military threats well down the list.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And even where military threats exist, they are not necessarily amenable to a military solution. The dire challenge posed by chemical weapons is being addressed, not by force of arms, but by a disarmament process under the Chemical Weapons Convention. The awesome problem of nuclear weapons is also being tackled by largely diplomatic means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not to argue that military forces have no place in our security preparations. They do, as Australia's participation in recent peace-keeping exercises attests. However, it is time to ask whether we are getting value for our security dollar&mdash;both the amount spent on defence, and the way in which it is spent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that the world is changing rapidly, but our security policy-making continues to be formulated along largely traditional lines, largely because of outdated thinking about defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To understand just how rapid the change has been, it is instructive to look at the developments in world affairs which have occurred since the last Defence White Paper, in 1987. At that time, President Reagan was in office and the Soviet Union still existed. Preparedness for nuclear war was at its height&mdash;Europe was twitching with nerves as American cruise and Pershing missiles faced Soviet SS-20s across the Iron Curtain. The Pacific Ocean was the scene of almost daily encounters between US and Soviet vessels carrying nuclear arms. Bloody conflicts were taking place in Afghanistan, Cambodia, Angola and Nicaragua, very much the product of the Cold War.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, in 1994, the Cold War is over. Cruise, Pershing and SS-20s no longer threaten to turn Europe into radioactive ash. There is a Democrat President in the White House and the Soviet Union has disintegrated. The oceans are being denuclearised, and the United Nations is attempting, albeit very imperfectly, to resolve conflicts which were off-limits to it during the 1980s. There are many bloody conflicts still taking place, but they are not the product of the old ideological rivalry and carry no risk of escalation to global war.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Australia's region, profound developments have taken place. In 1987, the region, like the world, was rent by Cold War divisions. The Asia-Pacific region, particularly South-East Asia and the South Pacific, were a source of potential threat and instability to our policy-makers. The Soviets had a large naval presence at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam, the Americans had huge bases in the Philippines, the French were testing nuclear weapons at Mururoa Atoll, Vietnam had forces in Cambodia, and turmoil in South Pacific island states such as Vanuatu, Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and Fiji were seen as an open invitation to malign foreign powers to intervene&mdash;even Libya got a guernsey. Our relations with Indonesia were about as low as they had ever been, and the prospect of a conflict between Papua New Guinea and Indonesia was a major security pre-occupation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our regional policy was to ensure the military dominance of the Western alliance in an uncertain and threatening world. Any talk of establishing an inclusive regional security dialogue was simply out of the question. Differences between the regional states were too great, and the United States refused to entertain any regional security initiatives because they would lead to demands for naval nuclear disarmament.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now in 1994, all that has changed for the better. The Soviet Union has left Vietnam, and Vietnam has left Cambodia. The US bases in the Philippines have closed, the French have suspended nuclear tests at Mururoa, and naval nuclear disarmament is a reality. A regional security dialogue&mdash;through the ASEAN Regional Forum&mdash;has been established. The recent visit of an Australian parliamentary delegation to Bougainville has been the catalyst for peace talks, which we hope will lead to a just resolution of that conflict. Our all-important relations with Indonesia have seen significant improvements, and border tensions between that country and PNG are much diminished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From an Australian perspective, to say that the world is a militarily safer place now than in 1987 would be a major under-statement. That is not to suggest that all is well in the garden. We have continuing differences with Indonesia, particularly over human rights. China remains in the grip of a dictatorship with disturbingly belligerent impulses. But there has nevertheless been a dramatic improvement in our regional security environment, and there is good reason to believe that the trend will continue. The web of interdependence is growing stronger as regional co-operation grows in many areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet our military force structure, and the policy framework on which it is based, has changed little since 1987. The signs are that the forthcoming Defence White Paper will be a `steady as she goes' document. Our defence force structure has changed little in the last twenty years, and is not expected to do so for at least the next ten.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But the longer our defence policy stands still, the more it will fall behind. The new world order, to use a phrase which sounded so unconvincing when uttered by President George Bush to justify the Gulf War, is beginning, despite all the teething problems, to mean something. The growing openness of national borders, and the increasing strength of international institutions, is undermining the rationale for traditional national defence preparations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The argument which is used to justify this snail's pace of change is the uncertainty principle&mdash;the regional or global climate could deteriorate unexpectedly, and we need to have the forces in place to deal with traditional threats which could result.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This argument fails to take into account the opportunity cost of defence. We are spending $10 billion per year on a largely traditional defence force designed to meet largely traditional threats, even though we are facing major security challenges for which solutions have yet to be found.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unemployment is an obvious example. Australia's underlying level of unemployment is at record levels, as is long-term unemployment, and there is little reason to be confident that the measures announced in the unemployment White Paper will work. No-one disputes that the social fabric of the nation is being damaged by this trend.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pressure on the domestic and global environment, with causes too numerous to mention, is growing daily, with serious implications for survival of our species at its current population levels. To pick a recent example, the Auditor-General has recently stated the obvious by concluding that the Government's greenhouse response strategy is not working. The Government's reaction is likely to be to abandon the strategy, rather than get serious about solving the problem.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Global security challenges&mdash;political, economic and environmental&mdash;are mounting, and global solutions are required. Yet we lack effective institutions to co-ordinate those solutions and provide leadership. The United Nations is ill-equipped to perform this task because of the ossification caused by the Cold War, and is in any event grossly under-resourced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats would argue that we cannot afford the luxury of spending large sums of public money to resource an obsolescent defence policy. We need a new defence policy which reflects the times we live in. And we need an overarching security policy which addresses all sources of national insecurity&mdash;economic, environmental, political and military&mdash;in a cohesive and rational way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Democrats' view, a rational assessment would conclude that greater resources should be devoted to meeting non-military threats, and that our defence force should be restructured away from the Cold War model to one which is better suited to life in the new world order. With the defence capital budget dominated by the frigate and submarine programs, it is worth recalling that those vessels were justified as meeting Cold War needs. Their post-Cold War relevance is highly questionable, and the questioning needs to start now, before we embark on further naval modernisation, for example by replacing the destroyers, as though it was still 1987 and the Soviets were coming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Democrats favour a defence model which gives more priority to peace-keeping, peace-enforcement, and appropriate forms of regional co-operation. We believe less priority should be given to costly fighting platforms with little contemporary relevance. The emphasis should be on a more flexible and mobile defence system which is capable of providing greater peace-time benefits, such as coastal protection and fire-fighting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the purpose of this bill is not to prescribe the Democrats' favourite solution&mdash;it is to establish an inquiry to analyse our security challenges in all their dimensions, and come up with credible proposals to better address them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill establishes a Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry, consisting of 6 members nominated by the presiding officers of the two Houses of this Parliament. The Presiding Member of the Commission would be required to have experience in conducting public inquiries on complex issues. The remaining members would have expertise in defence, international relations, economics, the environment, and public opinion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's task would be to prioritise the security threats facing Australia, and to determine whether the current allocation of national resources to meet those threats is in proportion to their severity. They would be required to make policy recommendations to improve the effectiveness with which our security challenges are currently addressed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission's hearings would generally be held in public, however provision has been made for in camera hearings where the Commission decides they are appropriate. The Commission would report to the presiding officers by December 1995, and its report, along with a transcript of evidence, would be tabled in Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill gives the Commission substantial resources, and wide powers to obtain documents and oral evidence. Penalties for non-cooperation are specified, as well as for attempts to intimidate or hinder witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the Democrats' view, this bill is one whose time has come. The world is changing, and the security debate in Australia must catch up. Our foreign policy has fairly successfully adapted to the emerging new world order, but our defence policy has not. What we need is an integrated security policy, and there isn't one on the horizon. This bill is an attempt to set the ball rolling. I commend it to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">ABORIGINAL COUNCILS AND ASSOCIATIONS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the bill proposes a number of amendments to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act 1976, hereafter referred to as "the act", which are designed to improve the act so as to:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(i)create a new authority, the Australian Indigenous Corporations Commission, to replace the existing Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(ii)give the Commission two new functions being;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)the promotion of understanding and acceptance of, and compliance with the act, which will allow the Commission a greater role in providing support to Aboriginal Councils and Aboriginal Corporations; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)the power to prosecute contraventions of the act and contraventions of other law relating to fraud or dishonesty by Aboriginal Councils, Aboriginal Corporations or their members; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(iii)further streamline and strengthen the powers available to the Commission to arbitrate in disputes between Aboriginal Corporations and their members, and to take action to ensure that corporations meet their obligations under the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the basic features of the legislation have not altered since the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act was introduced by the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon Ian Viner, on 3 June 1976. The then Minister emphasised the relative simplicity and flexibility of the act to meet a wide variety of community needs, and the capacity of the act to take into account the particular cultural needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and groups.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act provides an inexpensive and straightforward method for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples to incorporate organisations. The act has continued to be a very popular option for incorporation for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities and associations. Since the introduction of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Amendment Bill in November 1992, the number of incorporated associations has grown from approximately 1600 corporations to approximately 2,100 corporations as at 31 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A small number of priority amendments were made to the act in 1992 to improve the accountability of Aboriginal corporations and to better protect the rights and interests of ordinary members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Board of Commissioners of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission, as representatives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, fully recognise that public accountability for expenditure in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs is a legitimate concern of the government. It is the right and expectation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, who are the clients of organisations funded by the Government, that those organisations are held accountable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Until the amendments to the act in 1992, the Registrar lacked the necessary range of powers to ensure that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations incorporated under act complied with the regulatory and public accountability provisions intended to protect the rights of members of Corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the reforms to the act contained in the 1992 amendments were designed to strengthen the response by the government to Recommendation 192 of the historic report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, that, in the implementation of any program or policy which would particularly affect Aboriginal people, the delivery of such programs should, as a matter of preference, be made by appropriate Aboriginal organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 amendments gave evidence of the commitment by the Government to the principle recognised by the Royal Commission, that Governments were entitled to require a proper system of accounting for funds provided to Aboriginal communities, and organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 amendments to the act have enabled the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations to be more effective in regulating and enforcing higher standards of honesty and clear and open accountability in the conduct of Aboriginal Corporations. Just as importantly, the Registrar has successfully performed the role of assisting and advising the members of Governing Committees of Aboriginal Corporations in performing their tasks for the benefit of their members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The overall management and daily control of the operation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations as they pursue their respective social, economic and cultural objectives will remain firmly in the hands of the elected committees and office holders. However, the thrust of the new amendments is to allow the new Commission to respond even more effectively in those cases where there is evidence of a breakdown in the management of Aboriginal Corporations or their accountability to their members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The establishment of the Australian Indigenous Corporations Commission will remove the confusion that has existed as to the roles of the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations and ATSIC. It will also remove any potential for conflicts of interest that could have arisen while the Registrar was an ATSIC officer. The new Commission will continue to improve the efficiency of the processes of incorporation, administration and regulatory procedures to ensure the public accountability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, just as importantly the amendments will improve the ability of the new Commission to assist the members of Governing Committees to carry out their management functions, and in the process, provide better service and greater protection of the rights of individual members of those Corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following amendments will provide for the establishment of the Australian Indigenous Corporations Commission:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 6 repeals the provisions relating to the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations and establishes a new independent statutory authority to be titled the Australian Indigenous Corporations Commission. It provides for the new Commission to carry on the functions of the former Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations and to take on the two new functions outlined at the commencement of this speech. It further provides for a full time Commissioner to be appointed by the Governor-General for a period of 5 years to manage the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 43 requires the Commission to prepare an annual report of its operations for the Minister to be laid  before Parliament, and to prepare financial statements to be audited by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another set of amendments will further contribute to giving members greater control over the operations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 21 allows a Corporation to give a mortgage, charge or other security under the act only if the membership decides to do so by special resolution;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 29 establishes the requirement that all Corporations must hold an annual general meeting between 1 July and 30 November each year and file with the Commission a written record of the minutes of proceedings at that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there is also a series of amendments which will improve the accountability and efficiency of the management of Aboriginal Corporations.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 19 and 20 set out provisions relating to persons who are disqualified from holding positions on a Governing Committee. These provisions prevent a person who was previously a member of a Governing Committee of an Aboriginal Corporation which was wound up, or had an administrator appointed, from being elected or holding office as a member of a Governing Committee for a period of 5 years. Persons who are undischarged bankrupts, or have committed acts of insolvency are likewise disqualified.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">A person can apply to the Commission to be exempted from these provisions and can appeal to the Minister where an exemption is refused;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 22 to 27 provide for greater flexibility for Aboriginal Corporations in changing their names and their rules, and improve the efficiency of the procedures for the appointment of public officers, the filling of public officer vacancies and the keeping of an up to date register of members;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 28 strengthens the arbitration role of the new Commission;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 30 provides for further improvement in the standards of accounts required to be submitted by Aboriginal Corporations to the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 32, 33, and 40 will improve the ability of the Commission to conduct examinations of the records of Aboriginal Corporations and provide for offences in  relation to obstructing an examination being conducted by the Commission;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 41 extends the grounds under which the Commission may appoint an Administrator to an Aboriginal Corporation, and simplifies the process to improve its timeliness and effectiveness;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the proposed amendments in this bill will set up a new Australian Indigenous Corporations Commission and will improve upon the already substantial gains in flexibility of operation and standard of public accountability established by the 1992 amendments to the act. There will be higher standards of public accountability required of Aboriginal Corporations, but most of the amendments will have little effect on Corporations operating responsibly in accordance with the act and their own Rules.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, although extensive consultations have taken place following a previous review of the act, all Aboriginal Corporations registered under the act will be fully informed of the details of these proposals. The Minister intends to write to each corporation, the ATSIC Board of Commissioners, ATSIC Regional Councillors, the Land Councils and other parties enclosing a copy of the Draft Amendment bill, and a Plain English Guide to the proposed amendments, and he will seek the views and comments of all interested persons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister has instructed that the second reading debate will not take place until he has had an opportunity to consider in detail the views of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples in relation to the bill. The Minister also intends to have the ATSIC Board of Commissioners consider the bill once more prior to debate. This is of course consistent with both Government policy and the Minister's strong personal desire for proper negotiation and consultation on all major legislative and policy developments in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMINAL CODE BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the bill is to begin the process of codifying Commonwealth criminal law. The bill contains Chapters 1 and 2 of a new Criminal Code. During the next 5 years the Code will be systematically built around these chapters. Chapter 2 is the most fundamental part of the Code. It contains the foundations of the new Commonwealth criminal law&mdash;the general principles of criminal responsibility. By the end of 5 years these principles will apply to every Federal offence unless there is need to vary these by reason of special considerations applying to particular offences. When this is achieved, for the first time since federation those accused of Federal offences will be dealt with under the same principles&mdash;no longer will people charged in different States and Territories be treated differently from one another.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This step is long overdue. It is partly a recognition that the Commonwealth criminal law has grown enormously since federation. Indeed, back in 1914 when the Commonwealth Crimes Act was first enacted most of the criminal law was contained in the Crimes Act and Customs Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even in 1914 an attempt was made to adopt common principles of criminal responsibility by section 4 of the Crimes Act, which provided that common law principles of criminal liability applied in relation to Crimes Act offences. Since then Commonwealth criminal law has grown like a vigorous vine, branching out into topics such as the environment, health, heritage, insurance and banking, and offences which ensure meeting of our international obligations. Now most offences are found outside the Crimes Act. This means that in most cases the principles of criminal responsibility that apply vary from State to State because they are picked up from the local State and Territory law under section 80 of the Judiciary Act 1903. This is unsatisfactory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Codification of the criminal law has its roots in the work of the 18th century jurist Jeremy Bentham who, speaking of the English common law at that time, said:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Do you know how they make it? Just as a man makes law for his dog. When your dog does anything you want to break him of, you wait till he does it, and then you beat him for it."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the common law has come a long way since then, and the principles are more certain, Bentham's comment may seem to reflect the way the general principles of the criminal law are applied to anyone who travels from one Australian jurisdiction to another. A person might live in Tweed Heads, New South Wales and make a 10 minute trip to Coolangatta, Queensland. In many cases that person would be surprised to know that in relation to the commission of the same Federal offence markedly different rules apply. These differences are significant&mdash;in some cases they could be the difference between conviction or acquittal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The problem has become more significant now that we have such a mobile society, Australians are becoming more and more involved in business and recreation which takes them to other States and Territories on a regular basis. No longer are the differences in the law just an inconvenience for those who live in the border towns of Tweed Heads and Coolangatta and Albury-Wodonga. Indeed it also impacts on those who are involved in international trade with Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These problems were first addressed in the July 1990 report of the Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law chaired by Sir Harry Gibbs GCMG, AC, KBE, our former Chief Justice of the High Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The `Gibbs Committee', which also included the Honourable Justice Ray Watson and Mr Andrew Menzies, AM, OBE, recommended that there be general principles of criminal responsibility for Commonwealth law, and planted the seed of what became a national initiative to standardise the foundations of the criminal law across the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">State and Territory Governments were quick to take up the challenge and at the same time began to participate in the development of the general principles of criminal responsibility and other provisions for a Model Criminal Code. Indeed, it was the State and Territory Governments who initiated the idea of a Model Criminal Code for Australia. The Northern Territory Attorney-General, Mr Daryl Manzie suggested that the issue be placed on the agenda of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and out of that the Criminal Law Officers Committee was established (now the Model Criminal Code Officers Committee, made up of criminal law experts from each jurisdiction). The Committee was remarkedly successful at developing consensus on the general principles, in a process that, building on the work of the Gibbs Committee and the consultation it had undertaken, drew even more widely on contributions from the academic and legal professional community. There has been the most extensive consultation towards the drafting of this bill and of course we anticipate considerable comment will again be generated following its introduction into Parliament. We, of course, welcome such comment. The Standing Committee of Attorneys-General has agreed that it will aim to have in place the Model Criminal Code by the year 2001.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Model Criminal Code Officers Committee has worked long and hard to turn the concept of a Model Criminal Code from theory to reality. I am pleased to say that today I am able to take the first legislative step towards making the Code a reality.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth has a very wide range of offence provisions to amend consequentially. The magnitude of this task should not be understated. Many serious offences with a number of elements will have to be examined. If the Standing Committee's target is to be met, the Commonwealth must start now. In this I hope to initiate a dramatic improvement in the Commonwealth statute book, and also to show commitment to those State and Territory Governments who have invested their time and resources in the development of the Model Criminal Code. This project is a very significant demonstration that federalism works in Australia. As such, I believe it is a fitting project to contribute to our celebration of the centenary of our federation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the provisions of the Code now before the Senate. It is to be noted that these blend the two main approaches to the criminal law in Australia. On one hand the Code contains subjective fault-based principles of criminal responsibility which reflect the approach of the common law jurisdictions, while on the other hand it has provisions (such as those relating to intoxication) which are closer to the approach of the Griffith Codes. Furthermore it is a Code and as such accepts the underlying philosophy of the Griffith Codes that in such an important area of the law it is Parliament which should be determining the appropriate principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In setting out the physical and fault elements of offences and instances where fault elements do not apply, Part 2.2 adopts the usual analytical division of the elements of criminal offences into "actus reus" and "mens rea". The `physical elements' may be conduct, or the circumstances in which conduct occurs or a result of conduct. The `fault elements' refer to the state of mind of the person.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is in relation to the fault elements that the Griffith Codes and the common law have taken different approaches. The essential difference between the two systems is that criminal responsibility under the common law is based on subjective fault elements: what the accused knew, believed or intended at the time of the conduct. This is not so under the basic provisions of the Griffith Codes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In many offences under the Griffith Codes one or more forms of intention are express elements of the offence. In these cases, the difference between the Griffith Codes and the common law as regards intention is less marked. Nevertheless, in the case of many Griffith Code provisions which do not specify a fault element the difference is more significant. There is no onus on the prosecution to prove a fault element and criminal responsibility can only be negated by the defendant raising accident, or honest and reasonable mistake, or that the event occurred independently of his or her will. In the common law jurisdictions if a fault element is not specified for a serious offence, the general rule is that a fault element (such as intention or recklessness) is to be implied, and that the prosecution must prove it as part of its case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Code follows the common law approach in specifying subjective fault elements. This was the preferred approach in the vast majority of submissions received on the Model Criminal Code and is consistent with the US Model Penal Code, the English Draft Code, the Canadian Draft Code and the Gibbs Committee recommendations. It strikes the right balance and strengthens the principle that the accused is innocent until proven guilty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the other hand the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General preferred the general approach of the Griffith Codes in relation to intoxication. The Code provides that evidence of self-induced intoxication may not be taken into account in determining whether the conduct was voluntary and that it cannot be considered in determining whether a fault element of an offence of basic intent existed. An offence of "basic intent" is an offence where the physical element is one of conduct alone (such as striking a person) rather than one requiring greater awareness (such as striking a person with intent to cause grievous bodily harm). This approach is similar to that in the law in the USA, England and Canada, but differs in some situations from the law in the common law jurisdictions of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory which follow a High Court decision known as O'Connor. In those jurisdictions gross intoxication can be taken into account in determining whether a person had intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the view of Commonwealth and the unanimous view of State and Territory Attorneys General expressed at the most recent meeting of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General that to legislate to enable intoxication to be used as an excuse for otherwise criminal conduct in relation to simple offences of `basic intent' is totally unacceptable at a time when alcohol and drug abuse are causing so many social problems. It is the Commonwealth's view that if a person voluntarily takes the risk of getting intoxicated to such a degree then he or she should be responsible for actions which would otherwise amount to an offence of basic intent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2.3 describes circumstances where there is no criminal responsibility, such as: where a person is under 10 years of age; suffers from mental impairment; is involuntarily intoxicated; or under a mistaken belief; or has a claim of right. Also covered are situations where there is some intervening conduct or event such as duress, emergency or self-defence. Apart from intoxication, which I have already mentioned, the most difficult issues concern mental impairment and self-defence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The approach taken in relation to mental impairment follows the basic principles of what is called the McNaghten test. The Code provides for a mental impairment defence primarily concerned with the determination of criminal responsibility, a legal rather than medical test. This issue must depend in part on the expertise of psychiatrists and psychologists but is not exclusively a medical issue. The approach adopted has produced a workable definition of mental impairment that allows the jury to hear relevant psychiatric testimony, based on the best scientific evidence, and properly leaves the ultimate question of responsibility to the jury.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The self-defence test is subjective as to the necessity of using force but the test as to the proportion of force used is objective and is similar to section 45 of the Tasmanian Criminal Code. Although not of great practical relevance to Federal offences, revision of the law of self-defence is very important in State and Territory legislation to which the same principles will apply. In this connection the approach taken in proposed section 10.4 should be noted. Attention is directed to the explanatory memorandum which examines how the issue of the so-called "battered women's syndrome" has been dealt with.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2.4 of the Code deals with extensions of criminal responsibility such as attempts, complicity and common purpose, innocent agency, incitement and conspiracy. Each of these extensions raise interesting issues which are dealt with in detail in the Explanatory Memorandum. The most notable change relates to the offence of conspiracy where measures have been included to avoid it being overused. This includes a limit that the offence only applies where the offence to which it relates has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or more. It also requires an overt act on the part of one of the parties to the agreement which forms the conspiracy and that proceedings only be commenced with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This addresses judicial and other criticisms of the use of conspiracy charges in recent decades.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 2.5 deals with the important issue of corporate criminal responsibility. It sets a basic standard of responsibility for bodies corporate in relation to general offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Code introduces the concept that criminal responsibility should attach to bodies corporate where the corporate culture encourages situations which lead to the commission of offences. The provisions make companies accountable for their general managerial responsibilities and policy. It provides that negligence may be proven by failure to provide adequate communication within the body corporate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In speaking about this part I must stress that it is still open to the legislature to employ reverse onus of proof provisions or strict liability for offences where the normal rules of criminal responsibility are considered inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the federal level this will need to occur in a number of important areas where corporations are the main players, such as environmental protection, where the potential harm of committing the offence may be enormous and the breach difficult to detect before the damage is done. For example, the Government is not planning to water down the requirements of section 65 of the Ozone Protection Act 1989 in regard to the matters covered by that act. Part 2.5 concerns general principles suitable for ordinary offences. It will be the basis of liability if no other basis is provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally Part 2.6 deals with proof of criminal responsibility and it sets out the respective burdens of proof to be discharged by both the prosecution and defence. It also deals with averments and restricts their use. It follows established principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly there are different views on particular issues, in some cases very strongly held, and the Government will take particular care to listen to the debate on those aspects of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will conclude by saying that for Constitutional reasons later parts of the Commonwealth Criminal Code will be different from the new State and Territory Criminal Codes as its subject matter will include what are currently Crimes Act 1914 offences and certain other serious offences, such as drug offences. Despite this, the offences common to the Commonwealth and State Codes will be expressed in substantially the same terms and offences unique to the Commonwealth Criminal Code will be constructed having regard to the same principles of criminal responsibility contained in this bill. The benefit of this will be that no matter where a trial is held in Australia, Commonwealth offences will need to be proved in the same way which, as the States modify the criminal law, will reflect a common national approach for all offences. This will have enormous benefits in terms of simplifying joint Commonwealth/State investigations and trials, the mobility of the legal profession and investigators and to Australian citizens.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's hope that this bill will not only be the beginning of a new era for Commonwealth criminal law, but for the criminal law of Australia generally&mdash;the beginning of one of the most ambitious legal simplification programs ever attempted in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LEGISLATIVE INSTRUMENTS BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This government is committed to improving the access to justice of its citizens. The Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 is a small but significant step in that process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late last month the Attorney-General released the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, which sets out a blueprint for future reform of the justice system to rebuild confidence in Australia's legal institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That report draws on a number of major reports recommending change to Australia's legal institutions. These include those of the Hilmer inquiry and the Trade Practices Commission, which focus on the benefits of competition principles for the legal services market, and of the Law Reform Commission, which is currently considering the issues of gender bias and the law. The Access to Justice Advisory Committee considered a large number of other reports dealing with aspects of the legal system, including the report of the Administrative Review Council on delegated legislation to which this bill gives effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Work is now in hand to build upon the recommendations made in the access to justice report and related reports and prepare a program for reform with the objectives that all Australians&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">should have equality before the law;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">have similar rights and privileges, regardless of their place of residence; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">should have equal access to legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Later this year the Attorney-General proposes to make a justice statement setting out the government's commitments to a fair, just and accessible legal system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill implements the government's response to the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council in its report on rule making. Those recommendations were endorsed by the Access to Justice Advisory Committee. The Administrative Review Council's report critically examined the existing process for making and accessing delegated legislative instruments and made a number of significant recommendations on ways to improve that process for the benefit of all those affected by such instruments. The government thanks the council for its contribution to the process of enhancing access to justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government did not accept all the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council. In particular, it did not accept the recommendation that legislation founded upon its report should not contain a definition of a legislative instrument. In the government's view the uncertainty that would have been created from not defining the term would have resulted in significant legal proceedings to determine the ambit of the legislation. The government's approach will relieve the community of that cost burden. The bill defines a legislative instrument in section 4 and has as its principal facet the exercise of power delegated by the parliament, and determining the law, or altering the content of the law. Regulations and instruments that are currently disallowable are expressly included.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another significant departure from the recommendations related to the proposals for sunsetting. The purpose of sunsetting was twofold. First, it would ensure that all existing instruments and future instruments were examined as to the appropriateness of their continuation. Secondly, it would have ensured that the instruments that were appropriate went on to the register. The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs report Clearer Commonwealth Law commented upon sunsetting and recommended the developing of a sunset program to promote rewriting of all subordinate legislation. The practice of sunsetting has been used but an evaluation of the benefits of the practice has not been undertaken. The government decided that until such an evaluation had been undertaken it would be premature to enact the practice particularly where it is a resource intensive practice to undertake.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Administrative Review Council also recommended that the consultation process be undertaken in all cases. The government considered this recommendation in the context of its white paper&mdash;Working Australia but decided that because of the burden in undertaking consultation it should apply in the first instance only to legislative instruments made under specific legislation affecting business. Whether the provisions for consultation should be extended outside the business context can be considered in the future in light of experience gained in this more targeted approach. The government would expect the Administrative Review Council to examine this aspect after the whole regime contained in this bill has been in operation for a period of three years as part of its evaluation of the regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The council also recommended that the regime apply to rules of court made by federal courts. Rules of court are made by the judges of the court to govern the conduct and procedures of their courts. Any supervision of the rule-making process by the executive or its officers risks interference with the independence of the judiciary and, accordingly, offending the doctrine of the separation of powers. The courts, however, accept that the principles of the legislation should apply to them. Accordingly the bill makes amendments to the various acts establishing the courts to provide for them a court specific regime based upon the principles in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill deals with the question of accessibility to the law. Primary legislation is already relatively accessible. Members of this House can obtain that legislation readily and the general public has access to it through the Australian Government Publishing Service bookshops and will soon be able to access it through the "Scale" database system run by my department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Delegated legislation is another matter. Some delegated legislative instruments are, like primary legislation, readily available. These include statutory rules, rules of court and other instruments covered by the Statutory Rules Publication Act. However, a substantial amount of delegated legislation is hidden from public access.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The community is entitled to know what laws exist and the effect of that law as it applies to them. If the relevant law resides in a filing cabinet in some Commonwealth department or agency or is hidden in the bottom drawer of some bureaucrat's desk the community generally only finds out about it when the department or agency seeks to enforce that legislative requirement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well as providing easy access to delegated legislation, the bill provides a process of review that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">affords the opportunity to sweep away any rules and regulations which have outlived their purpose or impose unnecessary burdens on business;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">will assist in identifying duplication and overlapping requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enables the development of proposals for amendments to ensure that all such regulation remains appropriate and up to date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accessibility will be achieved through the establishment of an electronic register of all new and existing delegated legislation. A member of the community who scans that register to find legislation of interest to him or her will be able to print a copy of that legislation. After the commencement of this legislation a new delegated legislative instrument will not be able to be enforced unless it is registered. For existing instruments a series of limited timeframes are being provided for registration of those instruments. If registration has not occurred by the relevant date then the continued enforceability of such instruments will cease after that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To achieve more acceptable and effective delegated legislation, as it applies to business a consultation process will be mandated. Under that process, the sponsoring agency will be required to provide affected parties with a legislative instrument proposal which analyses the need for the regulation, the costs and benefits of it and alternative ways of achieving the objectives of the proposal. This should ensure that any defects in the proposal are exposed and can be rectified before the regulation is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, it is proposed that the parliament will have a greater role in the scrutiny of delegated legislation. All registrable instruments will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. This is not currently the case with many delegated instruments. To achieve this end the provisions of the Acts Interpretation Act dealing with the construction and disallowance of instruments are being repealed and re-enacted in this bill. At the same time the opportunity is being taken to provide further powers to the parliament in dealing with disallowable instruments by enabling a deferral of consideration of a motion of disallowance for a period not exceeding six months. This will allow the executive government to remake or amend the instrument to achieve the objective specified in the resolution of disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These new measures will go a long way towards involving Australians, and this parliament in particular, in the process of making delegated legislation and ensuring that it is understandable, effective and up to date. Everyone should have cheap and easy access to legislation and this will be achieved through access to the electronic register. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate. I present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">INTERNATIONAL AIR SERVICES COMMISSION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">February 1992&mdash;Policy Reforms</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, on 26 February 1992, the Prime Minister announced as part of the "One Nation" Statement the most comprehensive program of international aviation reforms ever to be undertaken in this country.Included in this were the decisions to allow more than one Australian carrier to operate air services into and out of Australia (the so called "multiple designation" policy) and to allow Qantas access to domestic markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This removed the longstanding distinctions between international and domestic aviation in Australia and allowed the benefits of domestic deregulation to flow through to international operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A little more than two years down the track, these announced reforms have come to fruition with across the board gains for our consumer, trade and inbound tourism interests.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Establishment of the International Air Services Commission</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To give effect to the new multiple designation policy, the Parliament passed the International Air Services Commission Act 1992 (the act) and, through it, established the International Air Services Commission (IASC) which has the responsibility for allocating to Australian carriers aviation rights negotiated internationally by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The act ensures that route allocation decisions are made within a framework of:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">competition amongst Australian carriers for international operating rights;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">minimal administrative burden and delay with high standards of accountability and transparency;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">independence from Ministerial intervention and from the Government's responsibility for negotiating bilateral arrangements; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">conformity with Australia's international aviation obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the act, the Commission must determine the merits of competing claims according to public benefit criteria spelt out in an accompanying Policy Statement. This requires the Commission, in assessing applications, to take account of the extent to which each application:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">promotes tourism to, and within, Australia;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">benefits Australian consumers;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">promotes international trade;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">contributes to the development of a competitive environment for the provision of international air services; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">impacts on the Australian aviation industry overall.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Commission's Achievements</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since its establishment, the Commission has played an important part in ensuring the success of Australia's new aviation policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ansett began services to Indonesia in September 1993 and has announced plans for full-scale international market entry in September this year with Boeing 747 services to Japan and Hong Kong.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the same period, the Commission has awarded Qantas the capacity entitlements necessary to maintain that airline's status as a major world carrier.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Impact on Australia's approach to bilateral negotiations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In going down this path, the Government also needed to negotiate more expansive route and capacity entitlements required to support new entrants on prime routes and to maintain the growth momentum of Qantas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The move to multiple designation has therefore had the important and intended consequence of requiring Australia to further liberalise its approach to bilateral aviation negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been true particularly in the rapidly growing markets of south-east Asia and north Asia where major increases in capacity have been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the beginning of 1992, the Government has conducted an extensive program of bilateral air services negotiations with more than 30 countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of this, multiple designation provisions exist in the great majority of Australia's air services agreements, and in almost all major Asian markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the route rights and capacity entitlements required by the airlines to give effect to their expansion plans are in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Need to maintain the momentum</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the policy path on which we have embarked is undoubtedly the right one for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to build on the good work that has already been done by the IASC in helping to re-shape Australia's international aviation sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IASC has been operating for over two years. As with any new undertaking, there is a need to reflect on whether things can be done differently, and if so, whether the results will be better for the changes introduced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes a number of amendments to the IASC act of an essentially technical nature, designed to refine and streamline the Commission's </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">processes in recognition of the commercial imperatives under which our airlines operate. The changes proposed will lead to more efficient delivery of the Government's reforms and will benefit the airline industry as a result.<EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Broadening the scope of capacity considered under the act</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there is a need to bring air services on the Taiwan route within the scope of the act. Currently, Taiwan is excluded from the act as there is no formal government to government air services agreement in place between Australia and Taiwan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taiwan-Australia traffic, particularly inbound tourist traffic, is growing strongly and Taiwan is forecast to be one of Australia's major markets over the course of the next five years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Capacity on the Taiwan route is operated by Australia Asia Airlines (a Qantas subsidiary) under approvals issued by the Secretary of the Department of Transport. Whilst these arrangements provide Qantas with the necessary operational authority, IASC determinations would provide the certainty which Qantas and any new entrants would require.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will ensure that decisions on Taiwan capacity can be made by the Commission and will enable capacity currently being operated by Australia Asia to be treated as if it had originally been allocated by the IASC. It will enable the Qantas Board to identify with certainty the Company's route rights and entitlements in the prospectus to be prepared for the Qantas sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Streamlined Application and Evaluation Procedures</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill before you also establishes a basis for the Commission to deal more expeditiously with applications for capacity or for minor variations to determinations. It makes provision for the Commission to deal with some types of applications without necessarily applying the full range of criteria spelt out in the Policy Statement on each and every occasion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The situations in which a more streamlined evaluation process may be appropriate include where:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">capacity under bilateral arrangements is unlimited;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">only one application has been made for the allocation of capacity;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">there are no submissions opposing allocation of capacity to an applicant; or,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">an application for the allocation of capacity is opposed on particular grounds and only the public benefit tests relevant to those grounds need be applied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along similar lines, the bill provides for expedited procedures to be applied when, for example, a carrier wishes only to hand back capacity previously allocated to it. This reduces the time which other carriers may have to wait to then be able to apply for the available capacity under the usual procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Operational Decisions in Special Circumstances</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In some circumstances, the act prevents minor operational decisions, such as approval of supplementary services in peak periods, or to allow for minor changes in aircraft seating or aircraft type, from being approved. This can inhibit flexible airline operations by Australian carriers in a manner not faced by foreign airlines operating into Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government proposes to remedy this by allowing the Secretary of the Department of Transport to make minor and temporary operational decisions without prior reference to the IASC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The types of decisions which the Secretary could make will be prescribed by regulation under the act to allow Parliamentary scrutiny to ensure that the Commission's processes and independence are respected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Use of capacity by different members of a corporate group</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the act envisages that there will be circumstances when an airline awarded capacity will want to transfer that capacity to another party and it already contains provisions for this purpose. This bill also provides Australian carriers with the flexibility to operate capacity through different members of the same corporate group such as wholly owned subsidiaries or holding companies which are Australian carriers, subject to appropriate conditions being imposed by the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Internal processes of the IASC</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains a number of miscellaneous provisions designed to improve the Commission's flexibility in its proceedings and day to day operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These include:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing the Commission to deal with two or more matters concerning particular capacity in the same determination;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">permitting the Commission to operate with only two of the three members present;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions concerning disclosure of interests by the Commission; and,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provisions designed to reduce the administrative costs associated with publishing determinations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Financial Impact Statement</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will not involve any additional expenditure by the Commonwealth for the Commission's on-going operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the broad thrust of these amendments is to introduce as much flexibility to the process of allocating aviation rights as possible whilst retaining the need to apply proper public benefit tests where appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The changes proposed are desirable from the industry's perspective, by establishing less burdensome and time consuming procedures, and from the Government's viewpoint, in placing less pressure on the IASC's limited resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the lead up to the Qantas float, the changes will provide greater certainty in relation to the Company's rights and entitlements and enable the Board of Directors to approach the public with confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum for the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AND OTHER LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes amendments to a number of acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law or law enforcement matters. As a number of the amendments are technical in nature, I propose to discuss only the substantive amendments made by this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organization Act 1979 will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">include certain offences created by the Crimes (Ships and Fixed Platforms) Act 1992 within the category of politically motivated violence under the ASIO Act;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow the Director-General of Security to give a standing authorisation to an officer of ASIO to approve persons who are to be able to exercise the authority of warrants issued by the Attorney-General; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow officers of ASIO to apply for vacant positions in the Australian Public Service even though the positions have not been advertised as being open to the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The offences from the Ships and Fixed Platforms Act which will be included in the definition of `politically motivated violence' in the ASIO act are similar to those which are already specified in that act. They are of a type often associated with terrorist activities. Accordingly, it is appropriate to include these offences as acts of politically motivated violence against which it is ASIO's function to protect Australia and Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part III of the ASIO act permits ASIO, under the authority of a warrant issued by the Attorney-General, to collect intelligence by means of listening devices, searching of premises and the interception of mail. To protect individual privacy as far as possible, consistent with the need for ASIO to perform its statutory functions, only officers nominated in writing by the Director-General of Security may exercise the authority of a warrant. At present, these written authorisations must be made for each warrant. The proposed amendment of section 24 of the ASIO act will allow the Director-General to appoint particular officers of ASIO to perform the function of authorising those who may exercise the authority of a Part III warrant. The amendment will enhance administrative efficiency without in any way diminishing ASIO's existing accountability in the exercise of its powers under warrant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the final amendment of the ASIO act, ASIO officers are not employed under the provisions of the Public Service Act 1922 but under terms and conditions determined by the Director-General of Security. This means that they cannot apply for vacant jobs in the Australian Public Service unless those jobs are advertised as being open to the general public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the restructuring which ASIO has been undergoing, it is appropriate to enable officers of ASIO to apply for positions in the Australian Public Service. The object of this proposed amendment to the ASIO act is to put officers of ASIO in the same position as officers of the Public Service when applying for vacancies. Officers will compete on their merits and, if found suitable, may be appointed as if they were already a public servant. All appointments will be treated as promotions to allow for appeals by other candidates if applicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are several amendments being made to the Crimes Act 1914.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 10 and 11 of the bill implement recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission from its report entitled Multiculturalism and the Law in relation to the sentencing of federal offenders. The amendments will ensure that an offender's cultural background must be taken into account by a court when it is relevant to the sentence or order that the court will make, including when deciding whether to dismiss the charge, or discharge the offender on conditions without recording a conviction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in clauses 12 and 13 of the bill also relate to court orders made under the Crimes act. They will ensure that where courts impose conditions which include monetary amounts in recognisances (or bonds) made under paragraph 20(1)(b), the offender cannot be imprisoned for breach of a such a condition, and that where a federal offender commits an offence whilst on a recognisance, breach action may be taken, even if the order has expired at the time the person is convicted of the new offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 13 will also extend the range of options available to a court, where a person has breached a recognisance which has either a suspended sentence of imprisonment or a partially suspended sentence of imprisonment attached to it. The proposed amendments will enable the court to impose a monetary penalty not exceeding $1000, extend the period of good behaviour, or revoke the order and impose an alternative to imprisonment, such as a community service order.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also makes amendments to the "escape" provisions of the Crimes Act which create offences relating to the escape of federal offenders. The most significant aspect of these amendments is the removal of Australian Capital Territory prisoners from the ambit of the provisions. The Commonwealth is no longer responsible for ACT criminal law and the ACT has now enacted its own escape provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the amendment to section 85ZKB of the Crimes Act will remove scanning devices from the scope of the offence created by that section. Section 85ZKB prohibits the manufacture, advertising, display, offering for sale, sale or possession of equipment which is capable of being used to intercept a communication contrary to the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. Scanners are radio receivers which can automatically scan all broadcast radiocommunications and tune into whatever may interest the operator. They are capable of receiving telecommunications which are in part transmitted by radio signals: for example, cellular mobile telephones as certain prominent members of society have found to their chagrin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That scanners currently fall within the scope of section 85ZKB of the Crimes Act is an unintended result of the development of telecommunications technology which in part makes use of radio signals. I am advised that there are some three million scanners in use in Australia although it is, of course, impossible to confirm that number. The Government does not believe that it is reasonable to prohibit the manufacture, sale or possession of a device which is readily available and has a number of legitimate uses apart from the possible interception of telecommunications. However, it hardly needs to be stressed that unauthorised use of a scanner to intercept telecommunications partially transmitted by radio signals remains an offence under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 as does subsequent unauthorised publication of any material collected in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983 are being made so the ACT can be admitted into the national uniform interstate transfer of prisoners scheme as a participating State. At present ACT prisoners are covered by the Transfer of Prisoners Act 1983. Following ACT self government, the Standing Committee of Attorney-Generals (SCAG) considered the issue of the interstate transfer of ACT prisoners for welfare and trial purposes. The Cairns meeting of SCAG, held on 11 and 12 July 1991, decided that the ACT would be admitted to the national uniform interstate transfer of prisoners scheme, and it was agreed that the legislation of each jurisdiction would be amended to recognise the ACT as a participating State for the purposes of the scheme. The amendments implement that decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Schedule to the bill makes amendments to a number of acts. Again, I only propose to deal with the more significant of these amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will be made to the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991, the Crimes (Hostages) Act 1989, the Crimes (Internationally Protected Persons) Act 1976, and the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Act 1990 to transfer responsibility for issuing certificates relating to the entering into force and operation of certain multilateral treaties from the Attorney-General to the Ministers who are responsible for the treaties. The amendments will also remove requirements for gazettal of these certificates where this requirement exists. Gazettal was originally required to enable copies of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> to be tendered in court proceedings. However, this is not necessary in practice, since a new certificate may be issued each time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment to the Customs Act 1901 will ensure that, where a claim for recovery of items forfeited under the act is made but not pursued, the goods are automatically condemned as forfeited to the Commonwealth when the claim is discontinued or dismissed for want of prosecution. Currently, separate proceedings must be instituted for condemnation resulting in extra costs to the claimant as well as to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two amendments are made to the Director of Public Prosecutions act 1983. The first will give the Director the function of appearing in proceedings or inquiries held under the Crimes (Aviation) Act 1991. Australia is bound by international conventions to hold such inquiries or proceedings in relation to hijacking and similar offences on aircraft involved in international civil aviation. The amendment will ensure that experience in these matters is concentrated in one body. Inquiries and proceedings under the Crimes (Aviation) Act are also to be included among the matters in which the Director can give undertakings of immunity to witnesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second amendment concerns court orders prohibiting or restricting the publication of evidence or information in certain cases to prevent prejudice to the administration of justice. Courts already have this power in relation to civil remedy and recovery of pecuniary penalty actions instituted by the Director. The amendment will expand these categories to include proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 seeking restraining orders over property, or the extension of the period of operation of such orders. Before such an order can be granted, the court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the defendant committed a serious offence: a serious narcotics offence, an organised fraud offence or a money laundering offence. Satisfying the court of these matters often involves affidavit evidence which reveals details of witnesses or of an investigation. In some cases the court may need to make an order prohibiting or restricting the publication of this evidence to protect a witness or to ensure the effectiveness of a continuing investigation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to the Extradition Act 1988 made by this bill will ensure that Australia can fulfil its international obligations under the Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the related Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. Australia's accession to the Convention and Protocol took effect on 20 May 1993. The Convention and Protocol are designed to prevent and suppress maritime terrorism and they list offences in relation to acts likely to endanger the safe navigation of a ship or the safety of a fixed platform. Those offences are extraditable within the terms of the Convention and Protocol. As extradition will not be granted for political offences under the Extradition Act, it is necessary to put beyond doubt that the Convention and Protocol offences are outside the definition of `political offence' in that act. The amendment therefore excludes those offences from the definition of `political offence' for the purposes of the Extradition Act. The `political offence' definition has been limited in this way for a number of other multilateral Conventions to which Australia is a party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill makes an amendment to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 to enable Australian Federal Police officers performing customs functions on Christmas Island to receive reports on the transfer of currency into or out of Australia under section 15 of the act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the related explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CRIMES AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to amend the Crimes Act 1914 as an interim measure pending the commencement of the Criminal Code Bill 1994 which will not be completed for 5 years. While the Code bill is likely to commence in relation to its own offence provisions towards the end of next year, there are many Commonwealth offences which will need to be reviewed and consequentially amended to make them referable to the Code before it applies to them. The period of 5 years was chosen to ensure that the transition is ordered and that it occurs without disruption.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While interim in nature, this bill contains much needed and long overdue reforms. The application of common law principles of criminal responsibility means that all people accused of Federal offences will be subject to same principles of criminal liability wherever they are in Australia. The bill will replace section 4 which only applied these principles to offences against Crimes Act 1914.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The common law principles of criminal liability have been extended to other Commonwealth offences to avoid a situation where there would be 3  sets of principles in existence during the transitional period&mdash;the Code principles, the Crimes Act use of the common law, and the application of State and Territory law in relation to other offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that the common law principles have already applied to Federal Crimes Act offences since it was first enacted in 1914. At that time there were far fewer offences in other Commonwealth legislation. Therefore the change is consistent with the effect of the policy then, that is, in relation to criminal liability, people were dealt with under the same principles in different parts of the country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Code itself is largely based on common law principles; therefore this interim measure will be generally consistent with its principles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minimum age of criminal responsibility has for some time varied between jurisdictions. The minimum age for criminal responsibility is 7 years in Tasmania, 8 years in the ACT and 10 years in the other jurisdictions. This meant that a child from New South Wales on holidays in Tasmania could be accused and convicted of a Federal offence committed during the holiday, when at home he or she would not be charged for doing the same thing. This is clearly anomalous and requires reform. The approach taken mirrors proposed section 7.1 of the Criminal Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also in pressing need of reform are the laws relating to attempt and conspiracy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to `attempt' the Government was keen to see some clarification of this in some respects complex area of the law in the shorter term. In particular we wanted to act on the recommendations of the Gibbs Review of Commonwealth Criminal Law in relation to impossibility. The amendment ensures that couriers who believe they are importing a prohibited drug are unable to avoid being charged for attempt when it is discovered the substance is something else. Apart from the question of what fault element applies (which is not dealt with in this bill but is left to the common law), the provision on attempt is the same as proposed section 11.1 of the Criminal Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally the bill introduces new rules in relation to the offence of conspiracy. Measures have been included to avoid it being overused. This includes a limitation that the offence only applies where the offence to which it relates has a penalty of more than 12 months imprisonment or a fine of $20,000 or more. It also requires an overt act on the part of one of the parties to the agreement which forms the conspiracy and that proceedings only be commenced with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions. This addresses judicial and other criticisms of the use of conspiracy charges in recent decades. This reform mirrors proposed section 11.5 of the Criminal Code.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These measures ensure that during the period leading up to the commencement of the Code the reform process is not frozen. They will facilitate the introduction of the Code by following a consistent approach and helping to simplify the transition.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the Explanatory Memorandum to this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">MERIT PROTECTION (AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT EMPLOYEES) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make a number of amendments to the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act 1984.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act was one of the elements of the Government's public service reform package in 1984. The act provided for the establishment of the Merit Protection and Review Agency (MPRA) as an independent statutory authority responsible for handling grievances and appeals of public servants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government remains committed to the principles on which the MPRA was established and which are articulated in its legislation&mdash;fairness, equity, sound personnel management practices, efficiency and good staff relations. The Government sees the MPRA having an important role in preserving key values in Australian Government employment and, in particular, in preserving the merit system. In its first ten years, the MPRA has developed an enviable reputation for probity and independence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments cover a range of matters designed to facilitate and improve the performance of the MPRA's functions and to further the objectives contained in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most important amendment provides for the MPRA, or a committee established by the MPRA, to perform specified employment related functions in addition to those already provided for in the Merit Protection (Australian Government Employees) Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This means that the MPRA or one of its committees could, for example, at the request of a Commonwealth department or authority and the principal relevant staff organisation:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">mediate in a dispute; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">select staff for transfer; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">where there is a "spill" of positions, establish an order of merit for selection.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments also provide for the MPRA to deem a promotion appeal to be an application for review and vice versa to help avoid situations where an officer with an otherwise valid entitlement may be disadvantaged because of his or her lack of detailed knowledge of the relevant legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The MPRA will also have the power to issue guidelines to Joint Selection Committees which are tripartite staff selection committees with a convenor nominated by the MPRA. There is generally no appeal against the outcome of a Joint Selection Committee process with resultant time and cost savings in comparison to standard methods of staff selection. The MPRA currently has the power to issue guidelines in relation to Review Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The remaining amendments are minor, designed to bring particular provisions into line with similar provisions already contained in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I present the explanatory memorandum for the bill and commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">CUSTOMS TARIFF (URANIUM CONCENTRATE EXPORT DUTY) ACT REPEAL BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill proposes the repeal of the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. The repeal is part of a package of changes designed to streamline and refocus the Commonwealth's involvement in the Alligator Rivers Region of the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Three main features of the package of reforms, which were implemented by the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Amendment Act 1993, are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the incorporation of the Office of the Supervising Scientist into the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">refined mechanisms for consulting key stakeholders (including the Traditional Owners and the Northern Lands Council); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allowing the Alligator Rivers Research Institute to undertake research on matters outside the Region on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reforms also include the conduct of an independent review of the research now needed to meet the Commonwealth's environment protection objectives in the Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Uranium Export Levy was introduced in 1980 in recognition of the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers Region. However, with diminishing exports from the Alligator Rivers Region, due to the closure of the Nabarlek mine and declining exports from the Ranger mine due to the poor state of the market for uranium, levy collections have become uncertain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has also recognised that there was a general benefit to the community associated with the work of the Office of the Supervising Scientist and this portion should not be borne by the uranium industry. Ranger, as the sole producer in the Region and the only one contributing to the levy should therefore not be expected to meet the full costs of these activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The levy was also seen as inequitable to Ranger as there is no similar levy applying to any other mineral commodity. It also hinders Ranger's competitiveness, including against Roxby Downs in South Australia where the export levy does not apply.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result, the Uranium Export Levy has come to be seen by the Government as an inappropriate mechanism for  collecting an industry contribution to the special costs of environmental protection required for the Region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Government has sought a mechanism which more directly relates the industry's contribution to the environmental research needs of the Region and provides some certainty in its collection. It has therefore decided to replace the contribution previously collected by the Uranium Export Levy with a contractual arrangement with Energy Resources of Australia Ltd (ERA). This arrangement provides for the annual payment of at least $1.5 million to the Commonwealth. The agreement is subject to review after 2 years or in the event of any significant change in mining circumstances. The environmental research needs of the Region have recently been reviewed by a team of independent consultants and will be the subject of ongoing review through the Technical Committee established by the recent amendments to the Environment Protection (Alligator Rivers Region) Act 1978.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In return for ERA's financial contribution to research, the Commonwealth has undertaken to repeal the Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Act 1980. ERA's contribution will more than offset current revenue collections and result in a greater degree of certainty in revenue receipts for the Commonwealth and expenditure for ERA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill removes the Uranium Export Levy by repealing its parent legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINANCIAL IMPACT STATEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The direct impact of this bill is the loss of between $1.2m and $1.5m per annum in Export Duty based on the revenue received in 1992/93 of $1.538m and 1993/94 of $1.207m.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as the Export Duty is to be repealed on the condition that ERA agree to an annual contribution of at least $1.5m to research in the Alligator Rivers Region, there is no net financial impact as a result of the measures contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the Explanatory Memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LAW AND JUSTICE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994 will amend 5 acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature and makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation. None of the amendments involve major policy proposals. They are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Law Officers Act 1964 will allow the Governor-General to appoint a person to act as Solicitor-General during all periods in which the Solicitor-General is absent from duty or from Australia or is, for any other reason, unable to perform the duties of a Solicitor-General. This will allow a person to be given an appointment for a fixed term during which that person would automatically act as Solicitor-General during any vacancy or absences of the Solicitor-General without the need for an appointment by the Governor-General each time that the Solicitor-General is absent from duty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend Parts 5 and 7 of the Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 in relation to the enforcement of warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the act provides for interstate execution of a warrant (other than one for the non-payment of a lower court fine) issued under the law of a State. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a possibility that if a person arrested under an interstate warrant is released or remanded on bail by a magistrate and subsequently goes to another State, he or she might be invalidly re-arrested under the warrant in that State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Service and Execution of Process Act 1992 will be amended to provide that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">where the arrested person has been so released or remanded, the court, authority or tribunal that issued the warrant must be notified of the release or remand; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the issuing court, authority or tribunal must notify the police force of each other state which had been notified of the issue of the warrant of the consequences, under the act, of the person's being released or remanded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 of the act provides for interstate execution of warrants issued under State law for the non-payment of a lower court fine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is considered that, unlike warrants under Part 5, there is very little benefit in having warrants capable of being executed in more than one State. Accordingly, rather than provide for a notification procedure under Part 7 of the act, the bill will amend the act to provide that a warrant under Part 7 must be directed to police in one particular State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition the bill will strengthen the existing provision for withdrawal of a Part 7 warrant once a person's liability to pay a fine has been discharged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also clarify the provisions of the act in relation to interstate service of process at an address for service in proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">increase the penalties for breaches of the product safety and information provisions of the act to bring them into line with penalties for breaches of the consumer protection provisions of the act which came into force in January 1993;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow the use of penalty infringement notices as an alternative to prosecution for failure to notify the Minister of a voluntary recall of unsafe goods;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">include requirements consistent with Commonwealth criminal law policy to clarify the basis upon which an officer may exercise his or her powers of entry without warrant to inspect unsafe goods;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">bring the procedure for effecting entry to premises under a warrant issued under section 65q(5) of the act into line with Commonwealth criminal law policy; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">allow the Secretary to the Department responsible for the enforcement of the product safety and information provisions of the act to accept and apply to the court to enforce written undertakings in connection with matters in which he or she has powers or functions under the act.</PARA>

<PARA>I have great pleasure today in tabling the report of a recent visit to Taiwan undertaken by five members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. The visit resulted from an invitation from the ministry of foreign affairs in Taipei for seven members to visit at the end of May. Unfortunately, the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) and the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) had to withdraw from the visit at the last moment, so only five members actually travelled. The visit was led by the honourable member for Calare, Mr David Simmons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first part of the report's title&mdash;namely, `An island tiger'&mdash;reflects in many ways the progress that Taiwan has made over the last four decades. I am sure everyone in the chamber would be aware of the history behind the forced relocation of the nationalist Kuomintang government under Chiang Kai-shek to the island of Taiwan in 1949. Since that time, Taiwan's fortunes on the international stage have been somewhat mixed. With more and more countries recognising the People's Republic of China as the sole government of China, today only some 28 countries recognise the government of Taiwan. Australia, of course, is not one of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This visit to Taiwan was a first-class opportunity for those able to go to see at first hand the economic miracle that is Taiwan. Taiwan, with a population of 21 million people, has undergone a striking transformation over the last 40 years, from a largely agrarian society to being one of the most significant economic forces, certainly in the Asian region and beyond on a global scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taiwan's importance for Australia is undoubted. Taiwan is Australia's seventh largest trading partner, with two-way trade now valued at more than $5 billion. There are increasing levels of investment between Australia and Taiwan&mdash;$75 million in Taiwan; $225 million in Australia. Taiwan is a significant market for a number of Australian exports. For example, it takes 19 1/2 per cent of all the iron and steel which our country exports and 13.8 per cent of our aluminium, to cite just two substantial figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit, although it was unofficial, did allow the members of the committee to meet with very senior government, political and industry figures. Members of the delegation took the opportunity to raise with the Taiwanese specific concerns which they had about access to markets for some of our agricultural produce in the context of Taiwan's desire to join the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other issues raised included the question of United Nations membership for Taiwan, its future relationship with the People's Republic of China, and Australia-Taiwan relations in a bilateral sense. Issues such as improving educational and scientific links, tourism, business migration and environmental protection were also on the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the lifting of martial law in Taiwan in 1987, opposition parties are now legal and there have been multi-party elections. The process of democratisation has not always been smooth, but the delegation was encouraged by the goodwill on all sides towards maintaining and nurturing the democratic system. As parliamentarians they were very pleased to have the opportunity to meet with the Vice-President of the Legislative Yuan, or parliament, for discussions. I, for one, would like to see such parliamentary contacts maintained and strengthened wherever possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I would like to thank the members of the delegation who participated in the visit. I refer to the honourable member for Calare (Mr Simmons), the right honourable member for New England (Mr Ian Sinclair), the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Hunter (Mr Fitzgibbon), who each contributed in different ways to making what I have been advised was a most successful visit. On behalf of the committee I would like also to thank Mr Francis Lee and Mr Samuel Chen of the Taiwan Economic and Cultural Office here in Canberra for their assistance in facilitating the visit and underpinning its success.

I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will be aware of the process whereby the committee in each parliament inquires into and reports on the previous federal election. The committee will be handing down a comprehensive report in the spring sittings on the wide range of matters raised in connection with the 1993 federal election. There are, however, some particular issues which in the view of the committee require urgent attention and which are the subject of the short interim report which I have just tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These difficulties arise in connection with the return that political parties registered under the electoral act must make to comply with the election funding and financial disclosure provisions of the act. This is a fairly recent requirement, having been inserted in the electoral act by amending legislation in 1991 and which operated for the first time in the financial year that ends today. The political parties have found compliance with the new requirements so burdensome and expensive that they have made urgent representations to the committee seeking some streamlining and simplification of the legislation as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the submissions made to it and evidence taken at public hearings, the committee is satisfied that the electoral act could be amended so as to reduce the burden of compliance without compromising the principle that political parties should disclose the sources of their financial support. Under the current structure of the act, the parties have to bear ridiculous financial burdens in order to comply. The National Secretary of the Australian Labor Party estimated that it cost the national office of the party alone $30,000 to comply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was also told of the burden imposed on the ordinary membership of political parties. Small local branches have to maintain records detailing the cost of minor functions because they are liable to be spot audited. The committee agrees with the political parties which gave evidence on this matter at recent hearings that it is wrong to require a voluntary secretary of a branch of a political party or of any voluntary organisation to undergo the kind of auditing and questioning that is currently the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amount of detail required to be provided by branches of political parties seems out of all proportion to the mischief that the legislation was intended to prevent. For instance, the deputy federal director of the Liberal Party in his evidence told the committee that he had received a letter from one branch detailing funds amounting to $1,108 in all&mdash;two lots of money from fund raising events and one from an election night function. No amount exceeded $410. The functions were all held at homes of members, with food provided by members and drinks on a BYO basis. Yet technically all the contributions that were made should be accounted for under the act. As the writer of this letter complained, I hope we have not reached the stage where a casserole is regarded as a donation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this report we propose amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act that will reduce the amount of detail required to be disclosed. This will be achieved by introducing a $500 threshold for disclosure of individual transactions to reduce the need to aggregate small amounts and by placing the burden of compliance on the state and federal agents of the parties rather than on the members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government agrees with us, we would like it to act promptly. We would like any legislation that is introduced to be backdated and made effective from the beginning of the next financial year. We would like, if possible, to achieve a situation where the parties can avoid beginning the process of collecting data from the branches for the next financial year. For this reason we have proposed in the report that, if the government agrees with our proposals, it should put forward a statement of intent as soon as possible on which the parties could rely in deciding the extent to which they need comply with the existing requirement. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am happy to support this motion, and I do so as a member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. On behalf of the coalition, I commend this report to the Senate. I also speak as someone who had to work with the legislation as a state director of the Liberal Party. I am pleased that these recommendations are bipartisan. They are designed to improve the operation of the public funding and disclosure provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These recommendations follow two years of operation of this act and the deficiencies in it have now been exposed. I do not want to say `I told you so', but the coalition, at the time this legislation was being debated, did point out to the Labor Party some of the problems that we envisaged occurring in relation to these very onerous provisions in respect of political parties. We are delighted that the ALP has now seen fit to agree with us that there are significant problems. This has led to a bipartisan report designed to ensure that the objectives of the legislation are met but in a way which does not impose undue and onerous burdens on the political parties which have to work with this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for the parliament and the community to remember that these political parties, which have to comply with the legislation, are voluntary organisations with thousands and thousands of ordinary Australians giving up their time to work within the political process to maintain the vitality of our democracy. It is very clear from both sides of the fence that this legislation is imposing very major problems on the political parties. It is expensive, as Senator Foreman pointed out, and it is time consuming. There is an enormous bureaucratic burden on cash strapped political parties that they simply cannot wear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The worst of it is that the legislation is, in fact, discouraging voluntary involvement in the political parties, which I think is a distressing event.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, with the exception of a temporary increase in the membership of the Victorian branch of the Labor Party, the general trend is downward. Despite this legislation, the Victorian ALP seems to be increasing its membership. But I make the point that, just in the South Australian Liberal Party alone, we elect every year about 300 treasurers, all of whom are volunteers and all of whom have to deal with this legislation, which at the moment requires them to keep the most extraordinary records of every cent they spend and every cent they gain. No doubt, in the Labor Party, as in the Liberal Party, it is getting more and more difficult to get people to take on these officials tasks. We may be able to encourage them to join the party, but to get them to take on responsibilities within the party that have anything to do with finance is made much more difficult by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that these bipartisan recommendations will not compromise the objectives of the legislation, which we accept are required to ensure that the community does know where the political parties get their money from, but they will make it much cheaper and easier for the parties to comply with the legislation. Most particularly, they will enable the Australian Electoral Commission to enforce the legislation. We have the ridiculous situation at the moment where we have passed legislation when it is quite apparent to all of us that the Electoral Commission does not have the capacity or the resources to enforce it. It is completely snowed by it and unable to cope. The recommendations will make it much easier for the commission to enforce and apply the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summing up, both the Labor Party and Liberal Party members of the committee hope that the government will act quickly to give a clear signal to the parties and the Australian Electoral Commission about its legislative intent so that they can operate within the new regime as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA>The delegation comprised Senator Michael Beahan, the President of the Senate, who was the leader of the delegation, Mr Allan Rocher MP, the deputy leader, Mr Philip Cleary MP, Senator Alan Ferguson, and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The visit by the delegation to Germany was timely in providing an opportunity to observe and gain views on the tremendous changes which have happened in Germany since the reunification of the former Federal Republic of Germany with the former GDR. The delegation was accorded the highest level of hosting and access, which ensured that the visit was a great success. During meetings in Berlin, Dresden, Weimar, Gotha, Erfurt and Bonn, we met a wide range of parliamentarians at the federal and state levels, as well as local government officials and business people. Our discussions enabled us to meet all the objectives of the visit to a high degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report the delegation has made a number of observations. We have supported youth exchanges for parliamentary, political and company training programs; the establishment of an Australian institute at the University of Potsdam; fact finding missions and international conferences to promote Australia as a base for business and investment; and a non-permanent seat for Germany on the United Nations Security Council, which has now happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the report we have identified a number of trade and investment opportunities in coal and wine export; opportunities for investment and technology transfer in the environmental clean-up of the eastern laender; and joint ventures and partnerships in diverse areas including rail, telecommunications and other high-tech areas. We have assessed German interests in the Asia-Pacific region, including noting their desire to participate in APEC. We emphasised the advantages of using Australia as a base for trade and investment opportunities in the Asia-Pacific region. We discussed a variety of matters related to the European Union, including Germany's program priorities when it assumes the presidency of the EU on 1 July. We compared the German and Australian experiences in parliamentary matters&mdash;including electronic voting, streamlining parliamentary processes and comparing the Bundesrat and the Senate&mdash;coping with unemployment, vocational training, the role of women, land ownership, multiculturalism, and migration and refugee issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We learnt about the different levels of government in Germany, the work of political foundations, issues facing the reunited FRG, including issues confronting the newest states, privatisation of companies in the former East, economic developments and environmental concerns, as well as foreign policy issues. We discussed changing German perceptions about contemporary Australia, and we promoted contact between camel racing enthusiasts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the United Kingdom the pace and nature of the program were very different. We had opportunities to meet a large number of parliamentary colleagues in a variety of informal settings to discuss a broad range of matters of mutual interest. Of special significance was the meeting with the Anzac Parliamentary Group. A brief call on the Lord Chancellor and official functions hosted by the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Scottish Office and by the Speaker of the House of Commons were highlights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation appreciated the opportunity to explore an interest in urban renewal by visiting Glasgow and the Canary Wharf development in London. We also explored the UK's role in the European Union. We identified opportunities for trade and investment, including aerospace and computer technology, wine, radiata pine door panels, ferries and catamarans. We promoted Australia as a base for trade and investment in the Asia-Pacific region. We compared the impact of GATT and the CAP, and the UK and Australian committee systems. We discussed media matters at the BBC and News International, and proposals to consolidate the offices of state agents-general in London. We also tried to change perceptions about Australia to make people more aware of the contemporary situation. A number of parliamentary matters were raised during the trip. We have also made observations about visiting delegations signing special guest books, the selection of gifts and opening the floor of the chamber to the public during non-sitting weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thanks must go to a number of people who contributed to the success of the delegation's visit. Our thanks go to President Klaus Wedemeier, President of the Bundesrat, for according us such a high level of access and hosting arrangements; the Berlin State Chamber of Deputies, the state parliaments of Saxony and Thuringia and the Bundestag must also be thanked. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only briefly to this report as I am aware of the pressure of government business today. I am very pleased to be able to support the remarks made by Senator Foreman in moving the motion to take note of this report. I would also like to place on record my thanks to fellow members of the delegation and to the secretary, Sue Morton&mdash;and I am pleased to see that she is here today&mdash;for her outstanding work both while this delegation was taking place and prior to the delegation leaving in order to make sure that our arrangements were as smooth as possible. I also thank Mr Fred Peppinck from the President's office who travelled with us. I thank the partners of the members of the delegation who contributed immensely to the overall success of this visit to the United Kingdom and Germany.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Foreman has given a comprehensive report of the people with whom we were involved in this delegation, and I certainly agree with all the sentiments he expressed. I refer particularly to the efforts of the Bundesrat and Bundestag in Germany for their role in ensuring that our time in that country was so well spent. We might say that rather hectic times were had, but every day was enjoyable and filled with interest and learning for us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the highlights for me was returning to Berlin after almost 30 years. I first visited Berlin in August 1965 on my way to Warsaw and Moscow. That was a time when the eastern European bloc was probably at its peak both politically and militarily. I think of the three hours it took to get through Checkpoint Charlie in Berlin in 1965 and compare it with modern-day Berlin where the vestiges of the wall in the centre of the city are no longer to be seen. We look at the freedom and ease with which people can move from one part of the city to the other. These things provide a stark contrast to the Berlin of 29 years ago. It was a highlight to me to see how far things, including politics, had progressed in that part of Europe&mdash;an area that was isolated from us for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impact of environmental vandalism by the former East German authoritarian regime, particularly in the southern states, made an impression on me. I think particularly of the visit that we made to an open-cut uranium mine&mdash;no longer working&mdash;which employed some 20,000 up until the time of reunification. Some 2,500 of those workers are now re-employed in environmentally rehabilitating the damage that occurred over a considerable number of years in the process of supplying uranium to the former Russian federation. To drive past and see wisps of smoke coming from the top of a slag heap is a sign of environmental vandalism that the rest of the world could not put up with. That highlighted for us the changes that have taken place in the last four years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another highlight was to visit the southern states of Saxony and Thuringia and to see the restoration work that is being undertaken in the major cities. Since the end of the Second World War very little work had been done on buildings that had been damaged. Because those buildings had not been completely demolished and replaced with new buildings, there was an opportunity for some of the former beautiful historic buildings to be restored. The effort that has been put into restoration is a credit to the Federal Republic of Germany. When people from other parts of the world visit such beautiful cities as Weimar&mdash;the home of Goethe and Schiller&mdash;they will appreciate the restoration work that has been accomplished. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation visited the United Kingdom and we had an opportunity to maintain the valuable traditional links that this country has had with the United Kingdom. We were very generously hosted by the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. While there, we were able to renew some old friendships. We were also able to discuss the changes that are taking place in Australia; changes that are not always recognised by some of our old long-standing friends to the extent that we would like them to be understood. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This comprehensive report was compiled as a result of a lot of work by the secretary to the delegation and from the input of members of the delegation. I commend this comprehensive report to the Senate. Once again, I thank all those members of the delegation for making it, for me, a most memorable visit to the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic of Germany. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a very brief intervention here as leader of the delegation. I was very proud to have led the delegation. I thought it was a highly successful delegation: firstly, in meeting all its objectives&mdash;a rare thing, I think, because often lofty objectives are set but very seldom met; secondly, in working well together as a cohesive team whose main focus was to present a positive image for Australia, and also to learn as much as we could while we were away. I believe all of those things were achieved. I want to briefly comment on four things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, the delegation set out to present themselves as sales people for Australia and, I think, succeeded admirably in doing this. Many positive comments were made not only by hosts, but also by Australians at the functions that we attended who said that we did that very well. I am proud that we did. We managed to convey a picture, I think, of Australia as a vibrant, changing place, increasingly involved in sophisticated manufacturing and services and no longer the farm, quarry and woolshed that many people imagine us as. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I want to mention the excellent organisation and access that delegates received in Germany. Senators Foreman and Ferguson have already mentioned this. It partly resulted from the previous visit here by President Wedemeier, the President of the Bundesrat, and his assertion that the organisation of his visit here by the Parliamentary Relations Office was excellent and among the best that he had ever seen in his many travels worldwide. He gave particular praise to one of our officers, Kieran Schneemann, and I would like to confirm that praise on behalf of the delegation because it reflected in the quality of the visit that we had to Germany. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing I would like to mention is the excellent work of the secretary, Sue Morton, who is in the advisers box over here. I have been on a number of delegations, but seldom has a report been tabled so soon, and very seldom has such a thorough and useful report, and one that is worth reading, been produced. I thank Sue not only for that, but also for the excellent support that she gave us as we went around. There was nothing left undone; it was excellent organisation. I would also like to thank Fred Peppinck, the senior adviser on my staff, who gave able support to Sue in the various roles that she played. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly and finally, I would like to thank the delegation who, I think, really put a full effort into this visit and made us all proud to be such a cohesive group that was really selling Australia in such a positive way. We came away from it feeling that we had done something very  useful, that we had learned a great deal, and that we had also made some very long-lasting friends from both sides of politics. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee has received representations regarding abuse of the corporate form in the textile industry to the effect that businesses have been structured so that the employees of the business have been employed by a company with limited assets while assets of the business are held by a separate company. If these businesses cease the company employing group employees have no assets with which to pay accumulated holiday pay, long service leave or redundancy payments and are placed in liquidation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Representations have been made to the Committee that a NSW group of companies, the Gazal group, had structured its businesses in this way and that companies in the Gazal group have failed to pay holiday, long service leave and redundancy payments to employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As well, according to press reports, the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union has initiated legal action against the directors of a Victorian company, Jeanswear Australia, which went into liquidation a week before Christmas 1993 with staff being told there was no money available for holiday pay, long-service leave and other entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee is extremely concerned that the corporate form, while continuing to provide a simple and effective business vehicle can be deliberately abused so as to avoid obligations to employees and creditors.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During its public hearing with the ASC the Committee reviewed progress on major 1980's corporate collapse matters, which came to be known as the `Big 16'. As well, the Committee heard in camera evidence from the ASC, which it does not intend to publish, on the progress of these investigations. The Committee appreciates these are extremely complex matters which predate the establishment of the ASC in 1991 but it has been concerned about public perception that progress on these matters has been far too slow.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ASC provided the Committee with information about the progress of these matters and outlined that in thirteen of the sixteen cases charges had now been laid and that further progress in these cases is dependent on the court process.

While this matter was not mentioned in the ASC Annual Report, the Committee raised it with the ASC Chairman during its public hearing in April.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Committee views this as an important issue for enforcement of the Corporations Law. There already exists a perception in the minds of many Australians that the law is incapable of dealing effectively with prominent corporate criminals, that complex matters take too long to be investigated and come to trial and that the cost of investigating and pursuing these cases is excessive.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That perception is not lessened by having major cases delayed by seemingly interminable reviews of the decision to prosecute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are talking about a proposition to exempt farm families&mdash;the farm itself&mdash;from the family payments assets test. There are very strong arguments for that, as indicated by Senator Woodley, whose latter point was that there are now heaps of farmers who on paper are asset rich but income poor. But that is not the only point, nor is it the major point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about the basic family payment. Let us get it into our thick heads that that is not a social welfare matter. It has always been a tax transfer matter. That was acknowledged when the tax rebate was abolished, cashed up and paid into the hands of the mother or the carer, who in most cases was the mother. It was acknowledged by the then Minister for Social Security, Don Grimes. It was also acknowledged and fought for tooth and nail by the opposition. Let us get it clear: we are not talking about welfare, we are talking about a tax transfer. We are talking about tax recognition. In this particular case, taking two farm families, one with six children and the other with two, the one with six children is paying more tax in the process of raising those children than the one with two&mdash;or, particularly, one with no children. So we are talking about a tax transfer measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about the farms. When the farmer comes to the end of the year&mdash;it is 30 June today&mdash;what does he do? He writes off depreciation on his header. He can get a tax exemption and tax concessions for the implements he utilises for developing his industry, which produces food for the nation and so on. The wife, the mother, is doing a very important job raising the children, the future taxpayers; but does she get any recognition for that? No. There is a grudging family payment, grudgingly given on the false impression that it is a welfare payment. It is not a welfare payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have a proposition to exempt the actual farm from the assets test. Why should that not be so? Let the opposition and the government say why that should be taken into consideration. If this is a tax transfer measure, as it is a tax transfer measure, why is there an assets test? Why is there an income test? If there were not, we would not have the problem where we have, theoretically, asset rich farmers who are income poor. I say theoretically because it is only on paper. In the bush people might try to sell their farms but not get any bidders. So while on paper a farmer might be asset rich, he will not be asset rich in practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask Senator Patterson, and Senator O'Chee representing the National Party of Australia, to think about what they are doing if they fall for the trap the government is setting on these issues. The trap the government is setting is to deny what its government spokesperson, Don Grimes, said at the time of the abolition of the tax rebate system: `We must always remember that family allowances are not a social welfare matter, they are a tax transfer matter which recognises that families with children pay more tax and do not have the same capability of paying tax as do families without children.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is going along the line we are talking about, why does it not then say to the asset rich farmer, `No, you can't have a tax concession for that header. No, you can't write off that header, we won't recognise that'? The government does not do it for their tractors but it does do it for their kids. That is what the government is up to, and let us think about that. I hope Senator Patterson and Senator O'Chee ultimately realise that. I thought that is what their parties were interested in&mdash;taxation justice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot leave that unanswered. Senator Harradine is implying that we are not prepared to look at this. We believe that this issue needs further consideration in more detail before it is put into legislation. An appropriate way to do this is to ask the committee to examine the ramifications. The Australian Democrats have every opportunity to do this; there will be another social security bill. It is not an issue that was raised. The Democrats have brought this in. It is not related to the bill; it is not an amendment to a government amendment. We know that that can occur from time to time. The coalition, and I presume Senator Harradine as well, have taken the opportunity, because a bill is before the chamber, to add something out of left field or right field that is not on the topic of the bill at the time but gives them an opportunity to put an issue before the chamber. I have said over and over again that the coalition, in its policies as we came up to the last two elections, indicated the need to address the issue of hardship in rural families.

We have an arrangement whereby, if we have amendments ready, we will often send them to the relevant people who are dealing with the issue so that they have time to examine them. But even a week would not have been sufficient time, with the party structure we have, to examine the amendment in detail and have our backbench rural committee and community affairs committee examine the implications of that amendment. </PARA>

What we oppose in this bill is the creation of imprisonment as the possible outcome of conviction. Within every jurisdiction in Australia governments have said that imprisonment is to be the option of last resort. Sadly, the last resort seems to be reached for first in far too many pieces of legislation. A very useful debate has arisen lately about the inadequacy of understanding of the concept of deterrents. We have a lot to learn from criminologists about when to apply penalties as a matter of sheer justice and when applying them with an illusion that a deterrent effect will result actually leads to injustice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we questioned this subsection in a briefing with ministerial and departmental people we were told, `Of course, it is not intended that people would be imprisoned. The note referring to the Crimes Act says that the courts can impose a fine.' That really begs the question. If people do not intend the measure to be used, why allow for it? The amendment replaces the imprisonment provision with a fine. The level of the fine has been chosen for its equivalence in the Crimes Act, hence these amendments I have moved in relation to the same subsection and to subsection 447(6); that is, to remove the note referring to the Crimes Act because that now will be superfluous. </PARA>

I realise that it is not likely to be supported at this time, but I think it is a very important matter and, therefore, deserves to be raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a very useful research report, research report No. 8 1993 from Western Australia, Ms Meredith Wilkie talks about women social security offenders and experiences of the criminal justice system in Western Australia. I would like to quote from a section of its introduction. Professor Richard Harding states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ms Wilkie's findings are powerful indeed. It emerges graphically that Magistrates Courts are overwhelming more likely to imprison women offenders for this category of offence than for any other category coming before themand that, moreover, women are more likely to be imprisoned for such offences than men are.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clearly a provision within the Social Security Act which is not intended to be discriminatory but has a discriminatory function because of the way it allows magistrates courts right throughout the country to have a very different approach to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Jill McClements, who is a Perth financial counsellor, wrote an excellent article that drew this issue to the attention of people in Western Australia. It appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Legal Service Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of February 1990. It had come to people's attention that an unprecedented number of women were imprisoned for social security fraud in Western Australia in the years 1987 to 1988. The article accounted for the dramatic rise within the 1980s of women's imprisonment as a whole. Fortunately, after considerable lobbying, that rise in women's imprisonment is tailing off. The issues that underlie it are referred to in this article. Some of the issues are being addressed at a local level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question being asked frequently is: what is the difference between fraud and a survival strategy for the poor, who are increasingly being locked out of the affluent society? While no-one would argue that organised rackets which siphon off social security funds to criminals should be curtailed, along with corporate tax evasion and white collar crime, the imprisonment of extremely disadvantaged people for first offences is another matter. In the article that I have referred to, the spectacle of dozens of very disadvantaged citizens being sent to prison for such fraud is examined with particular reference to the imprisonment of an unprecedented number of women for such offences in Western Australia in 1987 and 1988. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have some examples of the most appalling way in which people are penalised by having these provisions within the act; but I know we are short of time, so I will move on. However, it is an Australia-wide problem, not simply a problem in Western Australia. Michelle Robertson, in the August 1989 issue of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Inside Out</EMPHASIS>, referring to women and social security fraud in Queensland, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For women charged with social security fraud, the outlook is grim. Magistrates and judges are prone to judge women not only as offenders but by their status as women and mothers. We have seen that women in Queensland are more likely to receive a sentence than women in other states. This must raise concerns about the attitudes of officers of social security, police prosecutors, magistrates and judges. </PARA>
<PARA>She also raises a very important point. The impact of imprisonment penalties falls not simply on the person who has committed the offence, no matter how trivial its nature or how serious. Women's imprisonment also affects children within their care. Usually women have the primary responsibility for the support of their children, and a woman's imprisonment will often mean relocation of the child or children to other family members or friends. If other family members or friends are not on hand, the children will be placed in the care of the state. The effects on children are not taken into account by sentences. The economic and social costs of the disruption and the loss to children should be recognised by those who determine the punishment of the offender. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Upon their release, women also pay restitution to the Department of Social Security. This amounts to double jeopardy or a double penalty. In Queensland, the restitution is deducted at the rate of 14 per cent of whatever benefit the woman receives. If financial difficulties motivated the original offence, what is the point of further impoverishing the benefit recipient? It is time the community reassessed its attitude to social security fraud and looked behind the offence to address its causes. Clearly the threat of imprisonment is not a deterrent and actual imprisonment is not a solution. It is clearly time that this chamber looked at that too when we, on a routine basis, simply let offences and penalties that involve imprisonment slip through without checking what we are actually doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Wilkie notes that in many ways social security offences are similar to tax evasion. Yet, the former is viewed by the public and authorities as much more serious because the public perceives the tax office as taking from us, so any claw-backs we can achieve are to our credit. Welfare recipients are also seen as taking from us and many people feel offended about the abuse of a system which is generously provided for the support of the needy. Even though tax prosecutions have risen dramatically, only 0.2 per cent of tax offenders were gaoled in 1992 compared with 24 per cent of social security offenders in 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One judge, Her Honour Judge Kennedy, has noted that the DPP usually requests imprisonment for social security offenders but not for tax offenders. I think we have to look seriously at how the penalty of imprisonment is being used in a very inequitable way within our community. People have expressed concern that if we slow down the use of imprisonment as a penalty, this will encourage more serious crimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw to senators' attention the differential between taxation and social security fraud. I have a graphic example of that differential. There was a case regarding two estate agents who sold real estate in false names, who defrauded the Commonwealth of approximately $200,000 each, and who did not receive imprisonment; while in a case of social security fraud amounting to $80,000, the person got a minimum term of two and a half years imprisonment.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two of the cases reported in the l990-9l Annual Report of the Director of Public Prosecutions involved barristers who pleaded guilty to one count each of imposing on the Commonwealth contrary to s.29B of the Crimes Act. Both had understated their incomes by approximately $100 000 over three-year periods, evading the payment of about $50 000 each. Neither had any previous convictions. The first was sentenced to six months' imprisonment suspended upon entering a good behaviour bond for 12 months. He was barred from practice for six months by the Victorian Bar Association. The second was sentenced to three months' imprisonment also suspended upon entering a good behaviour bond. He was barred from practice for three months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another case involved two estate agents who sold real estate in false names and operated bank accounts in false names to conceal their property dealings. The total amount of tax evaded was $404 000. No prior convictions were mentioned for either of them. Both were sentenced to 18 months' imprisonment suspended upon entering into good behaviour bonds. They were both subsequently disqualified from acting as estate agents.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only one case study of social security fraud was reported and this involved a defendant with many previous convictions. It is therefore not a useful comparison. In the 1989-90 Report, however, there was a case worth comparison. This involved two people who were apparently not social security recipients. One worked for DSS and set up bogus claims. The other (not an employee of DSS) set up bank accounts into which the benefits were paid. Over a three and a half year period they received about $160 000 ($80,000 each). Both pleaded guilty to 20 and 22 counts respectively of defrauding the Commonwealth. Both were sentenced to four years' imprisonment with a minimum term of two and a half years. Neither is reported as having any previous convictions and there is no mention of what mitigating factors were raised.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While this case does not fall into the category of struggling welfare recipient trying to make ends meet, it does indicate the different approach taken to social security fraud. The person who was not employed by DSS (and hence not also guilty of defrauding his employer) should be compared with the estate agents who also set up false bank accounts to receive their illgotten gains. The estate agents defrauded the Commonwealth of approximately $200 000 each while the social security fraud was $80,000 each. One got a suspended sentence und the other a minimum term of two and a half years. While such comparisons are based on sketchy details of the cases involved, it is the way that such cases are reported in the annual reports, as much as the actual outcomes that is indicative of the different attitudes to the two types of fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Report notes that each magistrate in sentencing the taxation fraud defendants referred to the likely consequences on their professional and community standing. For the estate agents the Report notes that sentencing was affected by the defendants' backgrounds and the fact that they had lost community respect and professional standing. There was no reference in the Report to the outrageous greed that appears to motivate these crimes. It is obvious that the barristers must have had high incomes to be able to understate their incomes by these amounts, and it is of course well known that barristers are well paid. One of the defendants was a Queen's Counsel. Real estate agents also are usually reasonably well off.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of both types of fraud, matters considered to be serious fraud are charged under the Crimes Act. The elements of the offences are the same. So is the outcome, namely that the Commonwealth is denied funds to which it is entitled. Each person who evades tax thereby increases the tax burden on those who pay tax, in the same way that social security fraud does. One suspects too that the amount of money lost through taxation fraud far exceeds that lost through social security fraud. Yet the outrage from taxpayers is usually reserved for cases of social security fraud.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Cases of social security recipients imprisoned for fraud where need is a relevant factor were not reported in the annual reports, but do exist. The particular issue of women in Western Australia being imprisoned for social security fraud received much media attention in 1988. The DPP decided to defend their actions in their 1988-89 Annual Report. Since then it appears that decisions to prosecute are considered more carefully by the DSS, but some individuals prosecuted still appear to receive unduly harsh sentences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In determining sentence the magistrate or judge will take into account among other factors character evidence. This usually includes evidence of community standing and testimony from respected people who know the defendant. A high community profile and public respect are often seen as mitigating factors, and the effect on these of the conviction is seen as a type of punishment and in this way also mitigates sentencing. It could be argued that high community status carries with it a certain responsibility that has been breached, making the offences more rather than less serious. By contrast, a social security beneficiary is unlikely to be able to call character witnesses well known and respected in legal or business circles. Should a person be penalised because poverty and other social disadvantage make them less likely to be involved in an recognised for community activities? Should a person be able to gain advantage from a so-called `social standing' which is often based mainly on wealth or at least made possible by it, particularly when the conviction is for accumulating some of that wealth in a criminal, fraudulent manner?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect on the defendant's employment is also mentioned as a mitigating factor in the tax fraud cases. Certainly the estate agents suffered, as they were disqualified from acting as estate agents. Both barristers, however, were barred from practising for only a few months and then they presumably returned to their practices. Their employment is unlikely to be significantly affected, precisely because tax fraud is seen by many as a legitimate practice and the defendants as unlucky to be caught. The effect on the employment prospects of an unemployed recipient of social security benefits is likely to be significant. A criminal record will hinder them in obtaining employment, and would probably have a much greater impact on their future careers than a criminal record would for someone who is employed and established in their field.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Social security fraud needs to be treated more rationally and fairly, and a comparison with taxation fraud points out a reasonable perspective on the crime.

Section 48 of the Crimes Act allows the court to impose an appropriate fine instead of a term of imprisonment. The imprisonment penalties for failing to comply with a notice from the secretary are standard throughout the Social Security Act 1991. The potential penalty of six months imprisonment is the maximum penalty for repeat offenders and persons who deliberately set out to defraud the social security system. The courts have a wide discretion to impose a lesser penalty and would be expected to impose a lesser penalty in most cases. </PARA>

We have also to be clear that the intention of Social Security is to actually assist people with payments to allow them to survive. It is not about trying to minimise the amount they are paid or make it difficult for people.

It is important that we keep in mind the balance here. There is something to be said for all those people who have social security payments who behave honourably and do not intend to defraud. What we are talking about is not a wispy little mistake but an intention to defraud.

Also, for the Greens to come in and say, `Look, I know that pecuniary punishment is not quite right, but could you just accept that in the interim?' seems to me not acceptable either.

I was going to ask a couple of questions, but now I want to say quite clearly that I will not accept, nor should any senator accept, that a rejection out of hand almost of any amendment that is placed before the committee of the whole should be based on an assertion that a particular bill has been referred to a particular standing committee. In this particular case, as I am advised, that matter was not even a matter for consideration by that committee. But, even if it were, that is not the point. We have access to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>; we have access to the report. But the essence of the amendments are that they come before the committee of the whole and it is an obligation of every senator to examine those amendments and to decide how they will vote.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To use the reference of bills to committees as an excuse for not even properly considering amendments that come before the committee of the whole is, I believe, an attempt to undermine the function of the committee of the whole. It was made perfectly clear by me, by others and indeed by the proposers of the orders that certain bills may be referred to committees. It was made perfectly clear that those committees could not in any way, shape or form undermine or take the part of the debate in the committee of the whole. Let me make that perfectly clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Twice in so many days it has been said, `Oh, this matter has already gone off to the committee.' I do not accept that that should be an excuse for not properly considering here and now amendments that come before the chamber. Clearly, it is the responsibility of persons who are proposing amendments to ensure that sufficient notice is given of those matters. In this particular case sufficient notice, in my view, was given by Senator Chamarette. Certainly it has been sufficient notice for me to give consideration to the principles underlying her amendments. I have listened to the debate. I have been sitting here listening to the debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a couple of other questions to ask the minister, and I do so. I refer the minister to proposed subsection 446(8) on page 24 of the bill, which subsection says, `Penalty: imprisonment for 6 months.' That is contained in the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No.2). If this clause is accepted, that will go into the legislation. If a person is charged under this particular section of the social security legislation: firstly, is there no option for a fine; and, secondly, is there an option for the magistrate to impose a community work order as an alternative to imprisonment, as is said here?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to express my strong objection to Senator Harradine's implying that the coalition had not properly considered this amendment and was using the fact that it had not been referred to in committee as an excuse. I find that suggestion offensive. The coalition has examined this bill in detail through all its committees. This amendment has been considered and indeed I have considered it in detail with the shadow minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I was making was that we have a system in place to enable us to go into very great detail and to call witnesses, possibly including the people who wrote the articles to which Senator Chamarette referred. We cannot take such a course in this chamber. I would have liked to have had the opportunity to hear from those people and to consider that material in great detail. That is what the committee provides. Given our limited resources, we are not always able to get time to examine these things. We do not necessarily have time to examine all the research and criminology literature that is available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be that the answer lies not in changing the penalties, but in changing the culture in the administration of those penalties. I do not know whether that is the answer. If there are provisions to enable community service to be substituted as an alternative to a pecuniary fine or imprisonment, perhaps there needs to be a process of changing of attitudes among those who impose the penalties. Perhaps these issues need to be examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator Harradine that we have considered this matter. We are not using this opportunity as an excuse for anything. If that process had been used, it would have enabled all of us in this chamber to be more informed about an issue on which we have a concern, and indeed an issue about which Senator Chamarette is concerned. We have in place a system that enables us to examine issues more closely. In this case that system was not used. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was suggesting that as a method of examining the matter on this amendment, or indeed on a broader scale, the matter should be examined in greater detail. That surely is the preferable course rather than that Senator Chamarette, on every occasion that a social security bill is before us, should seek to change `imprisonment' to pecuniary fines, which she does not necessarily believe is the best course. I would rather see a more detailed examination of the issue so that we could then look at a possible amendment in a much more informed way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Patterson for her comments. I agree with her that the matter requires far more detailed investigation and examination of all the issues. I also agree that the solutions are not immediately clear. One should examine whether they are a cultural problem, an education problem or whatever. It is not always possible to know which issues are before the various parties under consideration and what they already know about and the issues that have not been considered. Sometimes one only discovers that sort of information when one reaches this place. One may decide to raise these matters on the floor of the chamber, via an inquiry or through a committee process. It simply happens that this was the point at which I decided to raise this matter because this is the most convenient way in which to do so. We are dealing with disability wage supplement issues and it is appropriate to look at the impact of those issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense I support Senator Harradine's comments. If Senator Patterson realises that this is a matter that is far more complex than any of us in the chamber have been able to grasp, clearly that gives good grounds for voting for my amendment and following it up with an inquiry. It is not a sufficient reason to refuse to support the amendment simply because Senator Patterson would prefer a more detailed examination. I think that we in this place have the responsibility whenever we vote for something to vote on the information that we have at hand. If that information is to the effect that a matter is complex and raises difficulties, one needs to support whatever decision of the chamber is most appropriate at that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take up the suggestion of an inquiry, and indeed I have been meaning to do so. However, I refute any idea that this is not an appropriate venue in which to raise the matter and ask people to think about it. In this chamber we have present the very people who are most likely to take the matter further at a committee or inquiry stage. Therefore, I do not draw back from introducing it in detail in this way. I hope that it will focus attention on the matter regardless of how the vote goes.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agree entirely with Senator Chamarette and her concerns. We are here being asked to insert into the social security legislation a provision which nominates a penalty&mdash;namely, imprisonment for six months. That is what we are being told to do. What Senator Chamarette is attempting by her amendment is to change that to a pecuniary penalty. We have been told by the government that it has the option of charging persons under the Crimes Act or under the Social Security Act. Under the Social Security Act the government has said, in answer to a question by me, that imprisonment for six months could be read to mean a pecuniary penalty or a work order as an alternative to imprisonment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has the right at present under the Crimes Act to make out a charge for the purpose of a gaol sentence. In my view, that should not be an option with a charge that is made out under social security legislation. Presumably, if there were the penalty of a monetary fine under that legislation, community orders could be read down as well. I am not sure whether that would have the desired effect. But that is why the minister is here, to clarify these matters for the committee. We are being asked by the government to put in a provision which states `penalty: imprisonment for six months'. That is what we are being asked to do. </PARA>

I am not a member of those committees, but I go along to and ask questions at many of them because of my interest. But it seems to me that it facilitates the process if people ask about issues of fact, which was happening yesterday. They were asking for details about the numbers of women in the 55-year age group, I think it was, and how many of them would be likely to go onto a pension.

The staging of hearings for a standing committee takes the secretariat about a week's work; it has to build up to it with the calling of the witnesses, the negotiations with various members of the committee as to whom they would like to hear from, the liaison with the department to ensure that submissions are tendered to the committee, and vice versa.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government opposes this amendment. The government's amendment removes the legislative requirement whereby rates of return for listed shares and managed investments which have been available for less than 12 months are to be extrapolated over a full 12-month period. It is a beneficial amendment that results in smaller rates of return for products which have been available for less than 12 months. It applies uniformly to all investors, irrespective of the day they entered into the investment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Greens' amendment is about something completely different&mdash;that is, the assessment of any product, new or old, held by persons for less than 12 months whereby only capital growth since the date of purchase by the person will be taken into account in determining the rate of return. The Greens' amendment is based upon a complete misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the rate of return methodology used to assess income from shares and managed investments. It has probably been proposed on the basis that it will result in smaller rates of return and, therefore, more favourable income assessments for all affected clients. In the interests of expediting the legislation, I think it is fair to say that the government will oppose this amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the key clause that extends the pensionable age for women from 60 to 65. We had a debate about this yesterday and, of course, there has been a debate about this since the announcement was made in the budget. I want to place very clearly on the record that this is a very retrograde step.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is going to place a further burden on women. It is going to take away from women an advantage that they already have. If it is necessary to take away an advantage that women now have in order to achieve equality with men, I do not think that that is in the spirit of support for women in this country. I said yesterday that my concern is with both those women who are in the work force&mdash;particularly part-time workers&mdash;and those women who are not. I gave the example of a woman who was working in a retail store of an evening on a part-time basis; she is 55 years of age and she is looking forward to age 60 when she can get a pension or a part-pension and retire. Now she is being told in this legislation that, instead of having five years to go, she has seven years to go. The government is adding another 40 per cent to the time that she has to work in order to be eligible for a pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I indicated yesterday, if workers were told that they would have to work for another two years to be entitled to long service leave, there would be a riot&mdash;there would be a strike, and so there should be. The government is taking an attitude which is anti-women, anti-worker and anti the woman in the home. In the latter aspect, we have a situation where a person who is 55 years of age now will have to wait another two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate for those members of the Labor Party who are listening that this proposal is being opposed by every peak organisation that represents women workers in this country. As late as March this year the ACTU stated very clearly that it opposed this legislation and sought to get the government to change it. Those who represent persons who have retired or who are pensioners also oppose this legislation. The purpose of this legislation is to allow the government to save a bit more money, but at whose expense? At the expense of the women of Australia!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not blame the minister at the table. She has a job to do, and I suppose in a way it is a very difficult job. Those who made this decision have done so for particular budgetary reasons and not really to give consideration to proper equality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The aim of opposing this clause is to reject the increase in pension eligibility age for women. The move by the government fails on the grounds of equity or logic. The increase, no matter that it is to be achieved over a lengthy period, creates a disadvantage for numerous women when they are at an advanced stage of their working lives&mdash;and the statistics on the position of women in the work force and their levels of remuneration show considerable inequity already. It will consign many women to a longer period of participation in the unemployment queues after they have spent many years out of the work force raising families and making an enormous but largely unrecognised and certainly unrewarded contribution to the wellbeing of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The change also defies logic when more and more men are leaving the work force early due to voluntary and involuntary redundancies and retrenchments. I will not ask the minister to do it now, but I ask rhetorically: could the minister look at the statistics on the shift in the effective retirement age for men over recent years? Furthermore, the government has recognised this shift in the working experience of older men by making special provision for older unemployed people in the activity test and benefit areas of the Social Security Act. As people approach retirement age and are less likely to find paid employment again, they are not required to go through the hoops associated with unemployment benefits. Why, then, place women in precisely the situation from which men have been relieved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know we canvassed this for a long time yesterday.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking to clauses 34 to 36 and to clause 37 so that the committee is not unduly delayed. In opposing these clauses, which will allow the Department of Social Security to deny a payment to someone who does not have a tax file number and has no intention of getting one, I want to provide the chamber with a number of quotations. The first is from Leonard Teale who, when talking about having to provide a tax file number, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is really an extraordinary invasion of a person's privacy. For a person to be forced to give information which is private, and for no good reason, is the action of a dictatorship and should not be happening in a democratic country. It is a matter of principle.</PARA>
<PARA>The honourable member for Pearce, Mrs Moylan, who I believe was the acting shadow minister for social security when this bill went through the House of Representatives, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is using jackboot tactics to force people into applying for a tax file number through the social security department.</PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think the loss of personal privacy and liberty by all Australians is too great a price to pay to counteract the small amount of fraud that is being detected.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the truth of the matter is that only about one per cent of social security overpayments are in fact the result of fraud. Mrs Moylan concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is eroding the rights of Australian citizens, treating all Australian citizens as the lowest common denominator and assuming that they are going to try to rip the system off. I do not believe that. I believe that the majority of Australians are decent, honest people who do not attempt to rip the system off. I do not think there is a need to pass legislation that makes that assumption.</PARA>
<PARA>Those were the words of an acting shadow minister for social security, and I could not agree with them more. There is no need for the government and the opposition to combine to pass legislation that assumes all Australian citizens are trying to rip off the system&mdash;yet that is exactly what they are going to do. </PARA>

It is always awkward to do this sort of business of the chamber at the very last moment but it is evidence of the ability we have, at times, to cooperate. That is the way I like to operate. Even though some folk may not think that is true of me; it is nevertheless the way I prefer to do the business of the chamber because I believe that by cooperating we certainly can achieve a great deal. At times one knows that it is a political tactic to confront issues but, where we can cooperate, that does provide us with an opportunity to achieve the very best result.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following its introduction into the Senate, and on the recommendation of the selection of bills committee, the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. On 30 May 1994, the committee presented its report to this chamber and recommended that the passage of the legislation should not be delayed. The Liberal and National parties take on board and, indeed, support the committee's two suggested amendments, to subclause 17(2) in relation to farmer saved seed, and subclause 22(3) in relation to the extension of plant breeder rights beyond 25 years, in that they provide safeguards against potential misuse of delegated legislative power and contribute to the transparency of plant breeder rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties support this legislation with amendments, notwithstanding the fact that Senator Woodley&mdash;in a consistent approach, might I say, for the Australian Democrats, who opposed the 1987 bill&mdash;has tabled a dissenting report, as we might expect, given the Democrats' philosophical opposition to plant variety rights and plant breeder rights. But let us not forget that Senator Woodley has also given notice for a related matter concerning the wheat and coarse grain industry to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. It seems to me that the Democrats are determined to attempt to return the grain industry to the Clydesdale era. The history of this bill and the debate on it has been long and controversial. Without wishing to prolong debate, it is necessary to take a brief look at the history to satisfy all concerned that this controversial issue has been thoroughly investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The existing Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 was the result of extensive public inquiry, debate and research which continued for something over 30 years. Debate has been extended since this legislation was introduced into the House this year and, indeed, is still continuing. The debate reflects clear differences in philosophical approach. In 1976, the Industries Assistance Commission recommended that legislation be put in place to ensure that Australia did not miss the boat in terms of available source materials for horticulture development. In 1979, the then Minister for Primary Industry in the Fraser government, Mr Nixon&mdash;might I say, a very good minister&mdash;drafted the first Plant Variety Rights Bill, which was introduced in 1981. Following extensive public scrutiny and comment, the bill was passed by the House of Representatives on 24 April 1982. However, subsequent debate in the Senate saw the bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, whose deliberations were interrupted when parliament was dissolved for the election on 4 February 1983. The committee's report was subsequently tabled on 10 May 1984 with two dissenting views. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Plant Variety Rights Bill was finally passed on 25 February 1987, almost five years after it was first introduced by Mr Nixon. But that passage was not until it was the subject of a Senate standing committee report and a 1986 federal government initiated inquiry conducted by Professor Alec Lazenby, the report of which was entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australia's Plant Breeding Needs</EMPHASIS>, and is known as the Lazenby report. Major conclusions concerned the adequacy of the breeding effort, deficiencies and imbalances, options and alternatives to PVR, the likely impact of protection and the effect on publicly funded breeding programs. Many of the revisions of the original PVR legislation take into account Professor Lazenby's findings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1988 the plant variety rights scheme commenced as a response to the 1987 legislation. After five years of operation, in 1993 an evaluation of the PVR scheme was undertaken by a consultant, Dr Alistair Watson, for the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. Its major objective was to maintain and improve the plant breeding effort in Australia and to encourage the private sector to invest more in breeding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While giving the plant variety rights scheme a basic seal of approval, Dr Watson's strongest criticism of the PVR scheme was that its objectives as originally envisaged&mdash;that is, to stimulate private plant breeding and to fund public plant breeding&mdash;were not being met and were indeed acting as a disincentive to investment in plant breeding. Dr Watson made several recommendations whereby private plant breeding could be stimulated and the scheme's financial viability and effectiveness could be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech on this legislation, the minister advised that the bill brings Australian legislation into line with the UPOV convention. Australia signed the convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, commonly known as the UPOV convention, in Paris in 1978. The entry into force for Australia was 1 March 1989. The UPOV convention was subsequently revised in 1991 and the rewriting and renaming of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 was primarily to conform to the UPOV convention revisions. The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 makes amendments to the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 which will be repealed. This 1994 bill gives effect in Australian law to the 1991 convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its recent consideration of this bill, the committee addressed the issue of the timing of the passage of this bill and Australia's accession to the 1991 convention. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy stated that it had received advice that the European Union and the United States of America are `poised' to enact national legislation in preparation for a session of the 1991 UPOV convention.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Conservation Foundation's objection to this bill is in part on the basis that no other countries have acceded as yet to the 1991 UPOV convention. Eighteen of 24 member countries have ratified the 1991 amendment but as yet none have acceded. The department, I note, is of the view that the 1995 accession to UPOV by Australia will be concurrent with the accession of these countries. Australia has not ratified the 1991 UPOV convention as yet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is my view that other countries being signatory to an international convention is not necessarily sufficient reason for Australia to become a signatory. However, the UPOV 1991 convention could well be the exception that proves that rule that I have laid down. Australia almost did miss the boat in terms of marketing opportunities arising from newly exchanged species because of the protracted debate on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem that in the PVR legislation's short history this country, particularly in its horticultural and nursery industries, has accrued enormous benefits. Many further benefits, some yet to be identified in yield performance and improved competitiveness, will accrue over time. The enactment of amending legislation in a domain where the majority of industries across Australia support it, albeit under the auspices of an international convention, is a positive move. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that PVR protection in Australia allowed breeders in other countries to introduce their varieties to this country. New Zealand stole the march from Australia in many horticultural varietal developments because of the delay in introduction of the initial legislation in Australia. I well remember seeing in New Zealand the advances being made, just as one example, in apple and pear production, as a result of their stealing a march on us in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through intellectual property protection, the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 enables plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants developed, as does the existing Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. In conjunction with protection provided by patents and trademarks, breeders are able to profit from their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of only three countries to have patents granted on plants. Australian plants have been patentable since 1976 and are subject to normal patent requirements. Thus breeders have the option in Australia of choosing patents or PBR to protect new varieties. Both PBR and patents, as forms of intellectual property law and protection, are voluntary. Both stimulate innovation and active research. Of the two, plant breeder rights is considered to be the most desirable as it favours farmers' rights and the public interest. Additionally, limited public interest provisions have resulted in very few patented varieties. Dr Lloyd's analogy of copyright at the recent hearings of the committee succinctly illuminated the advantage of plant breeder rights over patents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding the limited relevance of this bill for wheat growers, it is an area which I wish to address, given the significance of wheat growing in my state of South Australia. I must declare an interest as someone who has a potential beneficial interest in a wheat growing property. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;`Welcome aboard,' says Senator Panizza. As he and I both know only too well, in recent years wheat growing has not been a very profitable or beneficial exercise. But we will hope there are better days ahead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wheat breeding in Australia is a major enterprise. There are eight major wheat breeding institutions in the five wheat growing states. South Australia has two such institutions&mdash;Adelaide University's Waite Agricultural Research Institute established a formal wheat breeding program in 1925, and Roseworthy Agricultural College has undertaken variety testing since its inception in 1882. It has been responsible for many releases, from its first cross-bred variety, Daphne, in the 1920s to more recent disease resistant releases. The stated aim of this type of public sector breeding is to improve returns to the farm community. Lazenby concluded that, while the public sector should continue its role in plant breeding, the relationship and support of public and private sectors should be even-handed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal purpose of PVR is to provide stimulus for increased investment in plant breeding and to facilitate private sector investment and commercialisation. Previously, private companies were involved in plant breeding when their efforts could be protected by the use of hybrids which captured benefits for the commercial breeder. Hybrid crops such as sorghum fetch prices sometimes 300 per cent higher than wheat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is currently little incentive for farmers to register wheat varieties under PBR in Australia. Under plant variety rights in the United Kingdom, however, there are some 77 varieties registered. Eighty per cent of wheat in Australia is sown from farm-saved seed, compared with 20 to 30 per cent in the United Kingdom. Climatic conditions in the United Kingdom are not conducive to saving seed and farmers there purchase certified seed, paying royalties on it. In Australia, where seed is saved, mainly due to favourable climatic conditions, distribution is informal and purchasing of certified seed rarely occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real attraction of this PBR bill to the wheat industry is that it encourages the breeder to exchange material and bring in high yielding and high protein accumulating parental material for breeding. The new Plant Breeder's Rights Bill provides an incentive to do that and rewards breeders for performance. This is the first time that an incentive for private farmers has been addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The genetic gain outcome for Australia is not yet clear, given the relatively short&mdash;six-year&mdash;span in which PVR has operated in this country, and given the eight- to 10-year breeding cycle for wheat. However, PVR has increased the availability of an extended selection of genetic material and it can be expected that trends in Australia will mimic results in other regions. The United Kingdom has increased wheat yields by 77 per cent in 30 years of operation of PVR in that country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1993 the Grains Council held a workshop on intellectual property rights for plants, which examined the purpose of PVR&mdash;that of providing stimulus for increased investment in plant breeding in Australia, with the goal of facilitating private sector investment and the commercialisation of public sector bred cultivars. Workshop participants included Dr Watson, Professor Lazenby and representatives from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the Grains Council, the National Farmers Federation, state farmers associations, the patents office and the Plant Variety Rights Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation before us today received wide support from all of these groups and also from the Australian Wheat Board. Such legislative support, particularly from the Grains Council of Australia&mdash;which represents approximately 60,000 growers&mdash;and the National Farmers Federation, given its extensive involvement in the consultative process, cannot be discounted. Similarly these groups' support for the committee's amendments to clause 17 of this bill, dealing with the retention of farmers' privilege, which recognises the informal and practical distribution of seed within the sharefarming community through direct negotiation, also cannot be discounted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, greater rationalisation of plant breeding in the public sector has been identified as the means to free resources for work on crops with known export potential. New crop developments require selection and breeding effort to achieve good production and market penetration. Poorly selected varieties will not attract adequate markets. This need for stronger marketing was the subject of a report commissioned by the Grains Research and Development Corporation in 1992. It recommended greater coordination between plant breeders and grain end users to ensure that crop improvement was tailored to market needs and that 10 per cent of the budget of the Grains Research and Development Corporation&mdash;that is, $1 million&mdash;was spent on crop improvement research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the incentives provided by this bill, there is both opportunity and incentive for growers to obtain new varieties and to benefit from the commercialisation of their breeding efforts. A good example of commercial success in both production and marketing is of course the macadamia nut. A Queensland farming family was the first to be granted a PVR for two new varieties of macadamia nut in 1989. PVRs are currently available for over 90 plant species in Australia. First genera and species include varieties of the apple, macadamia nut, oil seeds, beans, cotton, grasses and kangaroo paw. These commercial successes earn millions in export dollars from just the macadamia, and potentially from tea-tree oil, and lend weight to the arguments for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the overwhelming support for this bill by the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia, the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, and horticulturalists and farmers alike, and given that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs has addressed the remaining concerns in relation to farmer saved seed and extension of plant breeder rights beyond 25 years, along with my opposition colleagues I support the passage of this bill, with the adoption of the amendments proposed by the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that it is the intention of the government to introduce some 11 amendments to the bill at the committee stage but we have been assured that those amendments are merely of a housekeeping nature. I know that some questions were raised about farmer saved seed by Senator Panizza during the second reading debate. In endorsing this bill, I am assuming that the minister will, at the appropriate stage, be able to satisfactorily answer those questions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From my position as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs, I would like to indicate a number of matters in support of this bill. The Senate will be aware that a plant variety rights scheme was introduced in Australia in 1987. Under the Plant Variety Rights Act of 1987, breeders of new plant varieties could claim exclusive rights to sell, or license others to sell, plants or seeds of varieties that they developed. The act required that plants and reproductive material should be available in sufficient quantities to meet demand, at reasonable prices, and that the holder of the right take all reasonable steps to ensure that requirements of the public were satisfied. New varieties of plants were eligible for PVR, if their genus or species were listed in the regulations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 was read a second time in the Senate on 24 March 1994. On 9 May, the bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs for inquiry and report. The bill proposes to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act of 1987 to enable plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants that they develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised that the aim of rewriting and renaming the legislation is principally to conform to the 1991 revision of the Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants or UPOV, as it is known. The committee was advised that the bill is consistent with Australia's obligations under the UPOV convention, and in harmony with United Nations Agenda 21, the International Convention for the Conservation of Biological Diversity, the FAO undertaking on plant genetic resources, and GATT. Officials from the department reassured the committee that all of the public interest features of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 have been retained and even extended in the PBR Bill. The department concluded that the essential balance between public interest and extended breeders' rights had been maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report identifies several features of the bill including an increase in the duration of PBR, an extension of PBR to include the import and export of propagative material, an extension of PBR to include harvested material in certain circumstances, an extension of PBR to include essentially derived and certain dependent varieties, and increased penalties for breaches of PBR. The committee's report, tabled on 31 May, addresses many issues raised by the 17 witnesses who appeared at the public hearing and the views contained in the 41 submissions received during the inquiry. I think it is important for the Senate to note that the NFF, the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia support this legislation. Other organisations such as the Australian Conservation Foundation expressed strong concerns about the bill, as did several individuals. Greenpeace registered its opposition to the bill based on philosophical grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee listened very closely to the arguments presented in evidence on the bill, and specific reference should be made to two clauses within the bill that received considerable comment. Firstly, clause 17 contains an exemption to the PBR, namely the farmers' privilege or farm-saved seed exemption. This permits a farmer to save seed from a crop to plant a future crop on the farmer's own land without infringing PBR. However, under subclause 17(2), the regulations may declare a particular taxon to be a taxon to which the principle of farm-saved seed does not apply. Secondly, clause 22 of the bill deals with the duration of PBR. Under this clause, the proprietary right lasts for 25 years in the case of trees and vines, and for 20 years for any other variety. Subclause 22(3) provides that PBR in a plant variety included within a specified taxon may be granted for a longer period by regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that both clauses refer not to a variety of seed, but to a taxon. `Taxon' means an official group from the species level or higher: that is, species, genus, family et cetera. In a commodity sense, `taxon' means wheat or barley or rice&mdash;the whole commodity. It was emphasised to the committee that a variety is not a taxon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Several witnesses raised concerns about these clauses, and their views are reviewed in some detail in the committee's report. In response to these concerns the committee formed the view that the processes associated with exemptions under clause 17(2) and extensions under clause 22(3) could be improved, in order to ensure openness and transparency within the system. The committee recommended to the Senate that the bill should be amended so that public notice must be given when the minister is considering an exemption under clause 17(2) or an extension under clause 22(3)&mdash;again, a question of transparency and of communication with the general public. The committee considered that its recommendations on these matters would allay concerns expressed during the inquiry about safeguards and guarantees in relation to farm-saved seed and indefinite extensions to plant breeders' rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the bill as a whole, the committee is of the view that it is not a major departure from the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987, the main differences being the scope and strength of the proprietary right it provides. The committee also endorses the policy framework underpinning the bill that will allow Australia to ratify the UPOV convention as revised in March 1991. Accordingly, the committee did not agree with the view expressed in evidence that the passage of the legislation should be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I think it would be appropriate for the following two matters to be placed on the record during this debate. Firstly, it should be noted that the statement of Dr David Godden, as quoted in paragraph 3.28 of the committee's report, refers to consultations with Dr Godden himself and not to the consultation process as a whole. Secondly, in a letter to the committee dated 30 May 1994, Dr Godden claimed that evidence from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy contained adverse reflections on his professionalism, academic standing and personal integrity. The committee met to consider this matter and, in accordance with Senate privilege resolution 1(13), agreed to provide Dr Godden with the opportunity to respond to this evidence. The committee also resolved that a supplementary report on this matter incorporating Dr Godden's written submission should be tabled in the Senate. That report was tabled on 2 June 1994 and has been circulated with the committee's principal report. I support this bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of very real problems associated with the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill. Senator Chamarette will address some of the problems relating to the environment, biodiversity, conservation and issues of conflict with native title and indigenous rights. I will concentrate my comments on some of the commercial implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are presented with a Plant Breeder's Rights Bill which is actually a considerable extension of the Plant Variety Rights Act it replaces. The older PVR Act was passed only a few years ago and only after extensive consideration of the implications over a number of years. This bill, by contrast, has been pushed through with undue haste and a minimum of consideration of understanding of the implications involved. It is important to understand the context of this bill. It is being pushed through as part of the general free-for-all caused by the development of the biotechnology industry and the attempt to claim and commercially or economically tie up all of living creation in chains of proprietary law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For years, organisations have tried to juxtapose ethics and justice with valid claims to the fruits of intellectual labour and claims on natural things. This area of the proprietary in ideas and in relation to plants was dealt with by various national patent offices, by copyright legislation and by plant variety rights. Biotechnology changed the nature of the claims. Suddenly, knowledge has virtually become a product. Knowledge of life is seen to be the basis for a claim over that life, not only the plants or other species as things but claims over the intrinsic nature of life and its components. Control over species and genes has immense implications in a variety of directions, not only for life but for our view of our position in the web of life and our actions in relation to other life forms. It also has immense implications for commerce and science of control over resources and the entire notion that there are common resources to which we have a responsibility and from which we should all expect to benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a sudden flood of legislation, conventions and legal frameworks setting up claims to life forms, genes, germ plasm and so on. Many of these frameworks are in conflict. The trade-related intellectual property regime that the Multilateral Trade Organisation is pursuing is different from that considered appropriate under the biodiversity convention or by the United Nations Council on Trade and Development's Intellectual Property Committee. Strong arguments are put forward by the non-aligned nations that there need to be international conventions to protect the interests of the south in relation to biological resources, particularly agricultural resources, and to give recognition to the generations of work done by cultures and societies generally dismissed under the phrase `traditional use of knowledge'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Initially, many of the biotechnology patents were granted as inventions and patent legislation was stretched into entirely new forms. In 1980 the first living creature, a bacteria, was patented in the United States of America on the basis that it was an invention. Modified genes and genetic technology were patented on the basis that they were new. The first higher life form, the onco-mouse, was patented in 1987. More recently, the barrier between modified and unmodified life forms was broken down with the patenting of naturally occurring bacteria and fungi. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not all nations feel the same way about patents, particularly in relation to biotechnology. Some nations refuse to patent some life forms or parts derived from life forms. The United States Patent Office, for example, has shown itself willing to go far beyond other nations by patenting basic monoclonal antibody technology&mdash;directly attributable to publications in major science journals and clearly meant to be free scientific information&mdash;while giving no credit to the scientist who made the discovery. It was the first nation to issue a patent on life, the first to patent unmodified life on the basis of specific search, and the first to patent the unmodified genes of a human being. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US patent office has been willing to issue patents of the cell lines of entire tribes of indigenous people in Central America and elsewhere. But even the United States patent office has some limits, and recently refused to issue a patent to the National Institute of Health, which applied to patent over 3,000 DNA sequences. That is about five per cent of the entire human genome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Europe has still not allowed the patenting of life forms, and there are strong restrictions against patenting most forms of life in Japan. Further, many new biotech developments are running foul of basic patent considerations. A number of patents have recently been refused in Europe on the basis that they are obvious, and have no innovative steps, given the state of biotechnological science and our knowledge of genetics. Some pharmaceutical developments run foul of restrictions of proprietary benefits based on the public interest in access to medicine and medical technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, the situation regarding patents in biotech is far from clear, and becoming murkier and less certain. Certain areas such as the patenting on unmodified higher plants have always been difficult, or impossible. The lack of clarity in regard to patents has resulted in increased pressure to use other ways of claiming proprietary interest in life and living resources. This is the basis of the push in plant rights and the rights over natural resources under biodiversity. As such, it is an area to change or propose legislation only after careful consideration, especially given the pressure to use the power of the Multilateral Trade Organisation to back up corporate proprietary claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New laws framed under biodiversity, plant variety or breeders' rights, or laws such as the WA CALM Act of 1993, extend proprietary claims, and grant exclusive rights in a variety of new ways. The WA CALM Act is so poorly thought out that it gives the director of CALM the right to grant exclusive right to flora, including all intrinsic biochemical and genetic aspects of that flora, to companies. This could include granting of exclusive rights to whole genera or the flora of whole areas. The PBR Bill is simply another piece of thoughtless legislation being rammed through without sufficient consideration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been claimed that the plant breeders' rights legislation will allow rights to be granted so that the pressure to patent plants will be reduced. This is nonsense. Corporations are proceeding to patent everything they can, and it is only where patent claims fail, or are likely to fail, that lesser forms of ownership are sought. Thus PBR will only add to the options for ownership and will be used where patents fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The plant breeders' rights legislation differs from plant variety rights laws precisely by coming closer to patents and allowing a broader claim and more exclusive control over plant resources. In allowing, under section 22(3), for the first time, the extension of proprietary claim beyond 20 or 25 years, the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill sets up the situation where effective ownership can be made effectively permanent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is worth noting that today's biotechnology companies are usually closely linked or wholly owned by either agribusiness or pharmaceutical companies. Agribusiness has also been buying up the world's seed companies. Agricultural and textile plant patents and proprietary claims are the dominant claims on life forms. In this context, W.R. Grace subsidiary Agracetus has been granted a generic patent in the United States on all new cotton developments for the next 20 years, a patent which covers the technologies for developing new varieties of cotton. It has also been awarded a similar patent for soybeans and has one pending on rice, and is likely to apply, on a similar basis, for control of peanuts. We understand that the cotton industry is the first to apply for exception to public access parts of this bill under the proposed clause 17(2), which would effectively forbid farm saved seed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers would know that control of the seed companies has been becoming more concentrated and has passed into the hands of agribusiness. Scientists would know that agribusiness corporations have been active in acquiring biotechnology companies, with the aim of modifying, patenting and controlling seed and crop production. This includes the development of `improved' plants whose major improvement is their ability to withstand high levels of herbicide. Monsanto has been vigorously working on herbicide resistant plants, which will allow plants to survive massive herbicide spraying to control weeds. Monsanto is also a major producer of herbicide. The green revolution was based on the production of crops that were short-stemmed and biologically able to use far more fertiliser than normal plants. They are largely poorer yielding if not given those massive doses of fertiliser, as well as requiring more than normal levels of pesticides and water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The companies that control agricultural inputs are often also the companies that buy crops. They will not only control seeds, and the research and development of seeds dependent on high levels of chemical inputs, but also control the markets for agricultural products. So they can work to determine what farmers can sell and therefore what farmers will grow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are already commercial problems developing around the world in relation to the control of markets. The move of Chiquita, formally United Fruit and the original banana company from which `banana republic' was derived, into control of fruit wholesaling has resulted in the `Chiquita standard' banana becoming the dominant variety of banana on the market. Likewise, in the United States, we see varieties of genetically engineered or selectively bred tomatoes and other products becoming dominant through the buying practices of large chains and wholesalers, with a consequent impact on what varieties farmers can plant commercially. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extension of plant breeders' rights to fungi and algae are clearly inconsistent with the Union for Protection of New Variety Plants convention, or UPOV. Fungi and algae are hardly agricultural crops, and they are not frequently seen as decorative plants. Where they are used, they are generally used only in the unmodified form, such as kelp or nori, or the Agaricus brunnescence mushroom, which are traditionally used as foods. The primary interest in these classes or kingdoms of life is for industrial or pharmaceutical purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The clause would allow the ownership of yeast. It would allow the ownership of the fungi used in producing cheese varieties. It would allow ownership of algae used in the production of carrageenan, agar, or a whole range of algal products used in the food industry and other industrial applications. We therefore are introducing control of resources used not only in agriculture and horticulture but in a whole range of other industries important to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with concern those people who are involved in the farming industry, including those people on the opposite benches, who rub their hands with glee thinking there are some benefits to be gained, without any real knowledge of some of the downsides of use that will be of particular disbenefit to Australia and its varieties of plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of algae and fungi under `plant' is of particular concern because of the definition in proposed section 5(1) of breeding as:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A reference in this Act to breeding, in relation to a new plant variety, includes a reference to the discovery of a plant together with its use in selective propagation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is of greater concern when coupled with the fact that `new' is not a defined term in the legislation. The demand for genuine newness in 26(2)(e)&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the variety is distinct from other varieties of common knowledge. . .</PARA>
<PARA>sets the stage for granting rights to any unmodified variety of plant that has not yet been formally described. In the current state of biology, this is the case for nearly all algae and many varieties of fungi. It may also include many varieties of native Australian higher plants, particularly those with pharmaceutical potential. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill represents a basic departure from the principle of the biodiversity convention, and the intention there to assure that nature itself is respected and protected, that any benefit from nature accrues to all people and that any traditional development and use of biotic resources is acknowledged and respected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence, companies can modify a plant slightly and then argue that anything like it is a dependant, or an essentially derived variety. No-one will argue for the common access plants that a variety is essentially derived or a dependent variety of a natural plant except, possibly, under section 35. Even there, the requirement in 35(1)(a) and 35(2)(a) that objection can only be on the basis of a commercial interest makes it difficult or impossible to object on environmental or social interest grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, this bill is part and parcel of the push to extend proprietary interests over all forms of life. It is a definite departure from the old Plant Variety Rights Act. It has been pushed through, in spite of the lack of clarity in relation to UPOV, the convention on biodiversity and various intellectual property conventions that seek to guarantee protection of public rather than private rights. It has been pushed through when a number of other laws which relate to this act are currently being passed or proposed at state and federal levels. It has been pushed through, when there is an adequate act in place, under the guise of updating the language. There is no excuse for this haste. If members of the government or opposition had any integrity they would send this bill up for adequate consideration with full public input and also attempt to integrate the various bills, acts and conventions on intellectual property and other claims of ownership in relation to life. This bill simply adds to the problem and, as such, its passage will be a disgrace. </PARA>

The bill is designed to ensure that Australia's plant variety rights scheme conforms with the 1991 convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, UPOV. To implement UPOV 1991 here, the Commonwealth government is enacting this Plant Breeder's Rights Bill, which goes even further than the UPOV 1991 convention in sweeping away the public interest safeguards included in the PVR Act of 1987.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Greens throughout the world have a fundamental philosophical problem with the concept of granting an individual or corporation a substantial right to control, manage, genetically manipulate and earn money from plants. Greens also disagree with plant breeders' rights because that encourages secrecy in research, restricts free exchange and places monetary profit above the needs of human beings. It is an indictment of our society that we place profits above the needs of starving people. While there is one starving person on this planet, plant breeders' rights remain a symbol of our society's inappropriate value system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On a practical level, the government is proposing some significant policy changes in this bill. The Department of Primary Industries and Energy, the minister and the PVR office have all argued that this bill is well within the scope of the original legislation, that it is largely a rewriting into plain English and, indeed, that it contains no new policy issues or changes. The Greens (WA) believe that any major policy shifts in the area of intellectual or property rights over living things should have the widest of community scrutiny and consultations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The department has argued that the exhaustive public debate through the 1980s canvassed all of the important ethical and practical issues relating to the PBR. However, the debate tended to concentrate on the issue brought up by particular legislative proposals and did not thoroughly cover all the serious matters raised by PBR. In fact, this bill contains at least nine important policy shifts. Each of these areas deserves a full public debate and should not slip through this parliament quietly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Conservation Foundation, Greenpeace, and many other concerned groups and individuals have done all that they can to stimulate public debate and awareness of the issues in this bill. However, all this parliament was able to muster was a one-day hearing with a few days notice. Even at this late stage, I hope that honourable senators will have the good sense to refer this bill to a committee again for more extensive community consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there are at least nine specific policy shifts that are of serious concern. First, the bill widens the definition of plants to include organisms such as fungi and algae, whereas they were specifically excluded in the original act. Senator Margetts has already referred to the detail of this. The 1991 UPOV convention did not cover this area, so I agree with the ACF that the government needs to fully justify why this should now be included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 6 of the bill allows for transgenic organisms that have been altered by the introduction of genetic materials from the animal kingdom to also be treated as plants. This is well beyond the 1991 UPOV convention and raises serious ethical dilemmas about the level to which our society should sanction and, indeed, provide financial protection to persons and companies that engage in manipulation of genetic material. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Margetts has already mentioned, the bill allows for an extension of the duration of the plant breeder's right beyond the period of 25 years. If this is not a significant shift in policy, I do not know what would be classed as such. This moves the right of a breeder closer to that of a patent. At the same time, the bill narrows the circumstances under which PBR can be revoked, as well as narrowing the public interest provisions contained in the 1987 act. Dr David Godden, in his submission to the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most dramatic case of diluted public interest provisions concerns extension of PBR to cover non-commercial varieties. . . s19(11) appears to expressly exclude non-commercial varieties from any action by government in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>It is grossly improper for this government to move to limit the public interest in such a divisive area of public policy without fuller consultation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes provision for farm saved seed but a closer look shows this inclusion to be almost worthless. A commodity producer can stop farmers from saving seed so as to protect the interest of the right holder. It effectively means that farmers will face the prospect of buying seed anew each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another clear example of a policy shift is the inclusion of criminal penalties for offences. Not only are we more willing to support and provide financial protection to persons and companies which engage in manipulation of genetic material and exercise these almost patent-like rights, but we can use criminal penalties for those who may be acting in the public interest to prevent some of that occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the 1987 act, infringements were a matter of civil prosecution by the owner of the right. Now the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions will be involved in the enforcement of criminal sanctions. And why? Because otherwise, we are told, the companies which own the best varieties simply will not release them for sale in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill introduces the concept of essentially derived varieties. However, the definition of this important new concept is sloppy and inadequate. The current definition in the bill states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a plant is taken to be an essentially derived variety of another plant if: (a) it is predominantly derived from that variety.</PARA>
<PARA>What does `predominantly' mean? Does 51 per cent mean predominant or should it mean 95 per cent or 99 per cent? This needs to be far more thoroughly defined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA Greens firmly agree with many others that if measures against essential derivation are to be enacted then the essential characteristics of a particular variety should be specified and claimed by the breeder at the time of making the application. Dr Godden's submission to the standing committee stated clearly that it is unacceptable for Australia to ratify the 1991 UPOV convention, at least to the extent that particular plant breeding techniques are identified with essential derivation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Matthew Baird, a legal consultant with the Cape York Land Council, gave evidence to the standing committee about native title and a potential conflict between Australia's commitment to UPOV and its commitments to its indigenous people. Senator Woodley's minority report from the standing committee states that the question of whether native title extends to genetic material has not yet been proven in a court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole area of genetic material and indigenous people's rights is a long way from resolution and fraught with difficulty. At that stage in the community, people are not aware of the extent to which legislative procedures tie things up and it is of great concern that we pass legislation that does that. A symbol of this, but not necessarily related, is something that is happening in Western Australia. Just as the neem tree was used for centuries by Indian farmers and doctors for medicinal and hygiene purposes, the tree's chemical properties are now subject to US patent. Similarly, concurvone, an active ingredient in the Western Australian smoke bush, has been patented by the US national cancer institutes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, whether or not the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill allows things to be used for good purposes, if the mechanisms by which they are brought out deprive indigenous people of their true cultural voice and rights and deprive all people of their rights, it is a very serious matter.

That report corroborated the government's viewpoint&mdash;a point that was made in my second reading speech&mdash;that the PBR Bill was not a major departure from the Plant Varieties Rights Act of 1987. The committee also did not agree with the view that the passage of the bill should be delayed. The standing committee also endorsed the policy framework underpinning the bill that would allow Australia to ratify the 1991 UPOV convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government concurs with the committee's recommendation that greater transparency be introduced into the process of developing regulations on farm saved seed and the duration of protection and has accordingly moved an amendment to the bill. If I need to, I will talk about that in some detail later on in the committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The standing committee hearing, and its consideration of the written submission, was the culmination of an extensive five-year period of consultation on this legislation. I stress that for five years we have been considering this legislation. As you, Mr Acting Deputy President, outlined in your speech on this legislation, it was first introduced back in 1982, more than a decade ago. So it is not as though the debate on this particular legislation and the successor bill that we are dealing with today has not been very lengthy and intensive. In fact, I think we could quite reasonably claim that this has been a piece of legislation that in principle has been before the Senate longer than almost anything I can recall in my four years here. It is blatantly false to claim that it is being rushed through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill that we are considering is not a departure from the existing act. That itself was preceded by a 15-year period of consultation that Senator Chapman and others have referred to in their contributions to this debate. It is time to proceed without further delay with the PBR bill. It is an improved piece of legislation drafted in plain English. It conforms to the 1991 act of the UPOV convention. It provides a sensible and workable balance between the breeder's right and public interest concerns that have been expressed over some 20 years of the debate. It fulfils Australia's obligations under GATT, and it does not conflict with&mdash;in fact it complements&mdash;the biodiversity convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to some of the specific issues raised by honourable senators. Senator Panizza acknowledged a vested interest in this matter. He raised the issue of certificates, who gets them, the problems relating to share farmers and whether a farmer is able to use seeds if they are involved in a share farming operation, who owns the food&mdash;he raised a variety of particular problems. To be fair to Senator Panizza, he was not aware of the government's amendment dealing with clause 68A, which apparently has been accepted by the opposition. I am not going to go into the details of that amendment, but I believe it does overcome the particular concerns that Senator Panizza had. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Woodley's contribution on behalf of the Democrats about the ownership of life was deep and meaningful, and thought provoking for those senators who were here to listen to it&mdash;I think Senator Panizza was one of those. It raised legitimate issues about the public debate of so-called patenting, or intellectual and property rights, in a variety of areas. However, this legislation is dealing with plants. We are not dealing with the intellectual and property rights relating to human beings or other parts of the animal kingdom. Whilst Senator Woodley's contribution was thought provoking, frankly, a large part of it was not relevant to the legislation before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One area of Senator Woodley's comments that I do take exception to is where he referred to vast stockpiles of food, saying that delivery of food is the problem: the financial system puts a block in the way of food delivery and that that really was the problem that we should be dealing with&mdash;we should not be dealing with plant variety rights. I have to say that is a very simplistic approach to the problem of the stockpiles of food around the world. It ignores, for example, a very complex set of problems of overproduction by both the EEC and the United States. They overproduce, they export that overproduction and there are enormous environmental and economic problems with that overproduction, and cross-subsidies directly affect the economic viability of Australia's agricultural exports. Also, it is environmentally non-sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Woodley to claim that all of the world's problems in the area of food production are primarily a problem of transporting food from the area of production to those areas not able to produce food, is a grossly simplistic approach to this particular problem. He goes on to claim that we should not be dealing with this particular piece of legislation because the delivery of food is all down to the financial system and the transport system. That is a complete nonsense argument. I am very disappointed with Senator Woodley's contribution in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill made some fairly critical comments about the Democrats and the Greens and their approach. I think he was appropriately critical in the circumstances. One area that Senator Brownhill dealt with&mdash;I am pleased to see the opposition taking greater cognisance of this&mdash;was the area of trade. Senator Brownhill said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . not only to our country but also to trade, making sure that we are in unison with the rest of the world. Australia is a part of the modern world.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Brownhill was referring to the UPOV convention upon which this legislation is based. For those people who are not aware of this convention&mdash;I had a good discussion about the UPOV convention with Senator Kemp, who was not aware of it, and I am disappointed he is not here&mdash;it is known as the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants, commonly known as UPOV. Australia has acceded to that 1978 UPOV convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am particularly pleased that there is at least one convention that the opposition is anxious to support and that we have found one that we can all agree on. The government has been very consistent in its approach to conventions but, unfortunately, on this occasion the Greens and the Democrats have decided that this is a convention that they cannot agree on. I think this highlights the difficulty we are having in this area of debate. However, I am pleased that at last we have found something in this area that the opposition can support. Senator Boswell has made similar urgings of support for the UPOV convention and of international conventions, in general, in a number of other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of research funding, Senator Coulter maintains an absolute purist view of the world. He has said that we do not need this convention because the CSIRO will do all of the research that we need to do in the area of plant development. Let us put aside the issue of the resourcing of the CSIRO: that will be an issue of some argument before another senate committee. The CSIRO does not have a monopoly on, or some sort of exclusive right to, all of the scientists in the world doing research in the development of new plant species. The CSIRO simply will not be able to do all of the research. Even if it were financially able to do it, it would not have access to many of the leading scientists in the world who make a contribution in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By taking this purist view of research, Senator Coulter wants to ignore and block Australia from accessing what is occurring in other parts of the world. It is simply an impractical approach by Senator Coulter. Senator Margetts made a number of comments about this matter&mdash;that it is being dealt with in undue haste; that it is a thoughtless piece of legislation being rammed through without due consideration. As I said earlier, this legislation has been before the parliament, in its first form and in a modified form, for 15 years. It has been the subject of two Senate inquiries and it was the subject of the Lazenby inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could not have had a greater public debate and more public input on any piece of legislation before the Senate. Then Senator Chamarette said that this legislation places profit above starving human beings on this planet. What does she mean by that? We had starving human beings on this planet long before we had even a thought about plant variety rights. Long before we had the legislation, we had starving human beings on this planet. We have had starving human beings for thousands of years. That is very regrettable and it should not occur but what on earth has that got to do with this legislation? Hopefully, arising from this approach&mdash;and I think it is occurring from what I have seen&mdash;we will have the development of new types of plants that will mitigate and minimise. Unfortunately, I do not think we are going to be able to eliminate starving human beings altogether from the face of this planet; I only wish we could. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hopefully, we will be able to increase production. This is occurring in a number of areas. Productivity improvement in agriculture will enable us to feed those starving humans. More particularly&mdash;returning to that issue Senator Woodley raised&mdash;those people in some areas of Africa will be able to grow their own food with these new varieties. Economically and environmentally, it is sustainable. We will see an end to the dreadful practices in Europe and the US of subsidised food production being carried out in an environmentally unsustainable way at Australia's cost, as well as the cost of those starving human beings particularly in those parts of Africa. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I really do get very concerned when we get these arguments from Senator Chamarette, Senator Margetts and, to some extent, Senator Woodley that somehow this is contributing to starvation on the face of the planet.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, this is not a major departure from the PVR Act 1987. The weight of legal and technical opinion does not support the view that has been enunciated by the Democrats and the Greens. We have had advice on that matter but I will not go into the details because of time. Senator Chamarette and other senators in opposition to this legislation talk about criminal penalties and the intellectual property law. They say that this is something new and it is not in the national interest. Criminal penalties and intellectual property law such as the Copyright Act and the Trade Marks Act are well-established policy. In fact, what is the sense of having a piece of law if we cannot enforce it?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These policy implications were raised with the criminal law section of the Attorney-General's Department and are not considered to be a major policy change. The penalty provisions in the PBR Bill conform to those in the Crimes Act 1914. As I said, there is no sense in having a piece of legislation without some form of appropriate penalty. If we do not have these penalties then the people that develop these, should they develop these new types of plants overseas, are not going to be prepared to provide them to Australian growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inclusion of fungi and algae is a major policy change. That has been asserted by the Greens and the Democrats. The UPOV convention is silent on the definition of plants, so the inclusion of fungi and algae is not in conflict with the convention. It is not necessarily something new. Australia has adopted the traditional view that there are two kingdoms: plants and animals. Since algae and fungi are clearly not animals, they are plants. In the 1991 UPOV convention and in the proceedings of the UPOV diplomatic conference in 1991, there is no intention to limit the scope of plant only to higher plants. Separate written advice from the UPOV secretariat confirms that the inclusion of micro-organisms would not be in conflict with the 1991 UPOV convention. Australia has specifically excluded bacteria and viruses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been some criticism that the PVR Bill recognises trans-genetic organisms, and deletion of section 6 has been proposed. New varieties of trans-genetic plants are eligible for PVR under the current PVR Act of 1987. Like the PVR Act of 1987, the PVR Bill recognises, as does the 1991 UPOV convention, that new varieties of plants&mdash;and I stress `plants'&mdash;as products of plant breeding are eligible for protection under PBR law; that the genetic engineering is plant breeding; that insertion of non-plant genes into plants is a common means of breeding new plant varieties; and that all new plant varieties are eligible for protection. The exclusion of new plant varieties from breeders rights purely because they were bred by different means would be in contravention of the 1978 or 1991 acts of the UPOV convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the issue of the PBR Bill extinguishing native title. This assertion was the basis of a submission to the Senate standing committee hearing on the PBR Bill. The government has sought legal and constitutional opinion of this matter from the Attorney-General's Department, which has the view that no provisions of the bill extinguish native title or contravene the biodiversity convention. Frankly, it is an absolute red herring for the Greens and the Democrats to raise that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, Senator Panizza was not in the chamber when I dealt with that issue that he raised in respect of the rights of the breeder. It does not extend to the use of grain or other harvest products from protected varieties as food or stockfeed. There is an amendment 68A that Senator Panizza might like to look at, which deals with some of the concerns he raised. </PARA>

The fundamental problem facing Australia, which eventually has got to be addressed one of these days&mdash;it is a long-term strategy problem&mdash;is what is known as vertical fiscal imbalance.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">Jean Obeid: Allegations of Criminal Conduct in Lebanon</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Issue:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A recent article published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> reports that Samir Geagea, a former Lebanese forces (LF) militia chief, has been charged with the 1990 slaying of a rival Maronite Christian politician, Mr Dany Chamoun, his wife and two sons. The article also states that among those charged with the slaying is a Jean Obeid who is believed to be living in Australia and who was a senior aide to the LF chief of security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Talking Points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A check of the department's movements database has revealed that only one Jean Obeid has entered Australia since 1990. That person was born in 1991 and he left in May 1992 after a short stay.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not my practice to speculate on who the person referred to in the article might be, nor is it my practice to rush to judgment on a person's guilt simply because of a newspaper report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Background:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A check of our movements database has revealed that three Jean Obeids from Lebanon have entered Australia. The first, (DOB 1955) arrived on 11.1.84 and departed on 22.1.84. The second, (DOB 1938) arrived on 17.6.88 and departed on 5.7.88. The third (DOB 1991) arrived on 16.1.92 and departed 7.5.92. We have no record of any other Jean Obeid having arrived in Australia since 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be that the Jean Obeid referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article is Antonios Obeid who arrived in Australia under the RSHP on 29 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for this assumption is that in a cable from Damascus dated 28 March 1994, we were advised that warrants had been issued in Lebanon on 23 March 1994 for the arrest of a number of supposed LF members in connection with the Jounieh Church bombing on 27 February this year. Two of those persons were Antonios Elias Obeid (DOB 1961) and Jean Youssef Chahine. Antonios Obeid is described as the son-in-law of a Geages who is referred to in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> article was referred to ASIO on 23 June 1994. It has undertaken a preliminary check and advised that it has "no trace of a Jean Obeid".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 13 April, ASIO advised that it had interviewed both Antonios Obeid and Chahine and "is of the opinion that it would not have been impossible for either to be involved either directly or indirectly but proof either way is likely to be difficult to find", and that "the balance of probabilities is that they have been targeted because of their past association with a Geages rather than solid evidence of their complicity in the Jounich bombing".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our records indicate that Antonios Obeid was granted a special humanitarian visa on 9 June 1993 and arrived here on 29 June 1993 (some seven months before the bombing) and that he has not departed since his arrival. Chahine arrival here on 8 March 1993 on a Fiance visa.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a cable dated 28 June 1994, our Principal Migration Officer in Damascus has advised that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">An application from Antonios Obeid was lodged in Cyprus following initial telephone representations from Mr Eddie Obeid MLC (NSW) in August 1992.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">When arrangements were made for our migration officer to visit Cyprus in October 1992, Mr Obeid MLC was advised by fax on 31 August 1992 that Antonios Obeid should lodge an application for RSHP entry in Cyprus no later than 28 September 1992 to allow interview to proceed. Antonios Obeid approached the Australian High Commission in Nicosia on 21 September 1992 and an RSHP application and nomination forms (which had been completed in Mr Obeid's (MLC) office in Australia and forwarded to applicant) were lodged.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">He was nominated by a brother, George Elias (DOB 1964) of 20 Bilgia Street, Ryde&mdash;an Australian citizen holding Australian Passport No. K1318586. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Senator Faulkner. The minister would be aware that forestry in Tasmania is somewhat of a hot issue. Tasmania's forests have probably been studied more than any other forests in Australia. We also have the largest amount of reserved or protected forests of any state in Australia. In the minister's most recent speech on environmental matters, he made reference to two issues that are causing a significant degree of concern in my state. The first relates to continued logging of old growth forests, and the second relates to the further nomination of world heritage areas, particularly an area known as the Tarkine. Can the minister advise the Senate and the people of Tasmania in what context his statement should be taken, given the substantial amount of assessment work that has already been done on the forests in Tasmania? Secondly, will the agreed process of negotiation continue with regard to nominations of world heritage areas?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have told relevant state governments that I will be pursuing the assessment of areas which have been referred for my attention. I will do this in accordance with the national forest policy statement and the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, and in consultation with interested parties. The Commonwealth does not intend to revisit existing information that it believes can be fed into the assessment processes. Previous studies will need to be examined on a case by case basis to identify how closely they can satisfy Commonwealth requirements. Wherever possible, assessments will be based on existing data with additional information being sought only where necessary to enable the Commonwealth to meet its obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second part of Senator Murphy's question on the handling of World Heritage nominations, I can assure him that with respect to the Tarkine, as with any other World Heritage proposal, I will act in accordance with the procedures that have been set down by the government. I think it would be worth while my setting out the processes involved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the Tarkine, the Wilderness Society has prepared and forwarded to the Commonwealth a document that claims the region is of World Heritage significance.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the Tasmanian government respond positively, the Commonwealth will enter into joint discussions to begin a comprehensive assessment of the World Heritage values of the area. If the Tasmanian government does not want to cooperate in the assessment of the Tarkine, the Commonwealth will need to consider seeking an independent assessment of World Heritage values of the Tarkine area. Such an assessment would need to match up the values of the Tarkine with the very strict criteria that apply to World Heritage listings.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tarkine would be evaluated against other World Heritage rain forests within Australia and also on other continents. Any such assessment would take into account all the information that is currently available. It would also be undertaken in consultation with other interested parties.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the Treasurer said on budget night when introducing the proposal to change employee share acquisition schemes, the purposes of the government's legislation were twofold. The first objective was to stop schemes which in many respects were tax dodges and enabled taxation obligations to be avoided. That is something that all honest taxpayers who meet their full taxation obligations would support. I note Senator Kernot's affirmative nod in that respect, and I know of her many statements of support in that respect. The second purpose was that many of those share acquisition schemes did not contribute to increased productivity or a greater sense of ownership of a company on the part of employees. That was a factor, although not a primary one, that needed to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>

Without questioning or criticising that, nonetheless I note the point that it is not something the government necessarily concedes. However, the Treasurer last evening issued a press release on employee share acquisition schemes transitional arrangements and certain superannuation aspects. That may well be the document Senator Kernot is waving around. My eyesight is not so good that I can read the fine print from this distance.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, a day is 24 hours in duration, or 1,440 minutes, or 86,440 seconds. Atomic clocks, which have been in use for some time, have been able to measure time more accurately than previously. The earth's rotation is not always 86,440 seconds; the earth's rotation varies according to the proximity of planets, the tidal flow&mdash;the amount of water sloshing around the planet&mdash;and the fact that the planet is gradually slowing down in its rotation. This means that we need to compensate by adding an extra second every now and again. The measurement of time is coordinated worldwide through the Paris-based Bureau of Weights and Measures. Australia has a number of atomic clocks. Two of them have been built by the CSIRO's Division of Applied Physics. Satellites compare the times on the Australian atomic clocks to times on American atomic clocks, achieving an accuracy to within 100 nanoseconds. The CSIRO atomic clocks are then used in Australia to set the time for other clocks, measuring that to an accuracy of 10 nanoseconds. That is how we know what time of day it is.

I note in that respect that a number of executions have taken place recently in that country.

How does the federal government propose to compensate the Tasmanian people for the actual and potential $335 million per year loss in export income that would result from his absurd proposal to phase out woodchipping by the year 2000? Furthermore, does the minister concede that plans to increase the size of the existing World Heritage area to include the so-called Tarkine would have an adverse impact on Tasmania's export oriented mining industry?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In relation to the first part of Senator Gibson's question, I remind him that in the industry statement of 12 March 1991 the Prime Minister announced that it was an objective of the Commonwealth for Australia to phase out exports of woodchips by the year 2000 and replace them with value added products. That particular objective was reaffirmed in the communique issued during the Special Premiers Conference held in July 1991, which noted that state and federal governments share the objective of phasing out woodchip exports from native forests in favour of downstream processing of the resource&mdash;pulp and paper mills&mdash;by the year 2000, such projects being subject to environmental and economic assessments. It also noted that woodchip export approvals would be considered on a case by case basis with full regard to the objective that Australia achieves the fullest return from its forest resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While not specifically referring to this policy, the national forest policy statement signed by the Commonwealth and all state and territory governments&mdash;with the exception of Tasmania&mdash;states that at present the Commonwealth government approves the export of unprocessed wood and woodchips from integrated harvesting operations and sawmill residues subject to controls aimed at ensuring that environmental values are protected, that the price obtained is consistent with prevailing world market prices, and that unprocessed wood is not exported if it is commercially feasible to process and add value to it in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most recent articulation of the government's position occurred in the second reading speech for the Forest Conservation and Development Bill 1992.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Watson remarked (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p 1525) on 8 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They suggest an amendment to the definition of constitutionally protected superannuation funds to include tax exempt bodies such as registered charities and churches.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response: </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prudential Corporate Management Limited has made representations to you suggesting that the definition of constitutionally protected superannuation funds be extended to include tax exempt bodies such as registered charities and churches. The purpose of the amendment would be to allow tax exempt bodies to invest on a tax exempt basis in life assurance companies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendment to exempt from tax constitutionally protected superannuation funds is to prevent the double taxation of benefits paid to members of such funds as a result of the decision of the High Court of Australia in The State of South Australia &amp; Anor v The Commonwealth of Australia &amp; Anor (1992) 105 ALR 171, 92 ATC 4066. The exemption flows through to investments in life assurance policies by constitutionally protected funds reflecting other provisions in the income tax law relating to the purchase of life assurance policies by superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The extension of the tax treatment that applies to superannuation funds to the investment by funds in life assurance policies is appropriate because the purchase of life assurance policies is an ordinary investment activity of superannuation funds. Life assurance policies are a particularly suitable form of investment for superannuation funds because superannuation funds have to pay out benefits on the happening of a defined event, such as the retirement of a member at a particular age or the death of a member.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The tax arrangements that apply to a superannuation fund and its life assurance policies are reflected in the tax treatment of any payments from the fund. As a result of the exemption of constitutionally protected funds from tax, any payment from such a fund is taxed as an eligible termination payment (ETP) from an untaxed source. Consequently, the higher rates of tax that apply to untaxed source ETPs will apply to payments from constitutionally protected superannuation funds. Therefore, it would be inappropriate to extend the definition of constitutionally protected superannuation funds to include tax exempt bodies such as registered charities and churches. The consequence would be that payments from such bodies would be taxed as ETPs from an untaxed source, at the higher rates that apply to such ETPs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Watson asked (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p 1525) on 8 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Can the Government explain why FBT has been extended to entertainment expenses given this together with the fact that it is not a "benefit" convertible to cash.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fringe Benefits Tax (FBT) serves the purpose of ensuring that remuneration received in the form of non-cash benefits is taxed on the same basis as wage and salary income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Applying FBT to formerly non-deductible expenses&mdash;including entertainment&mdash;ensures that the taxation treatment of remuneration provided in this form is not concessional compared to the taxation of remuneration received in the form of other fringe benefits or wage and salary income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Watson asked (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p 1525) on 8 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government give an assurance that if the employer cannot prove that a client was entertained that the whole of the expense will be deductible to the employer but liable for FBT?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATO has advised that as the information contained in this question is very wide ranging in its implications, a considered response is unable to be given. However, if the honourable Senator requires a response to a specific example I will be happy to forward this to the ATO for their response.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Watson asked (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p 1525) on 8 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Would the Minister clarify the position with respect to conventional clothing given the references to unconventional nature of clothing in the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recent Full Federal Court of Australia decision in FC of T v. Edwards confirms that additional expenditure on conventional clothing worn in a conventional way may be deductible under subsection 51(1) of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 in certain, limited situations. The Commissioner of Taxation has recently issued Taxation Ruling TR 94/22 on this issue. The Ruling clarifies the application of the decision from the Edward's case. The current amendments do not impact upon the application of that decision. I will arrange for you to have a copy of the Taxation Ruling.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Watson asked (<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> p 1525) on 8 June 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government confirm whether such clothing, whether or not it notes the name of the employer, will no longer be deductible under these provisions? </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government advise what the fringe benefits tax implications for employers who have supplied their employees with a white uniform which notes its name, but which cannot be said notes which profession or trade the wearer belongs?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Response:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be some misunderstanding as to the operation of the proposed amendments: they are not designed to eliminate deductions for clothing that may be worn by employees in a number of occupations, nor do they have that effect. The amendments, through the use of the definition of `occupation specific clothing' remove such clothing from the need to satisfy the Occupational Clothing Guidelines administered by the Textile Clothing and Footwear Development Authority (TCFDA). The Commissioner has advised that this removal will result in clothing that satisfies the definition being treated in a similar manner to protective clothing and compulsory uniforms or wardrobes. That is, the deductibility of the clothing will be considered under the terms of subsection 51(1), and not section 51AL, of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This effectively preserves the status quo, as clothing that satisfies the definition would currently be deductible under subsection 51(1) even though the clothing did not have a logo or similar employer identifier attached to it. For example, clothing worn by pharmacists, dentists and the like are not currently deductible under subsection 51(1) if they do not perform a protective function or they do not have an employer identifier, or something similar, to make them unique and distinctive. Expenses incurred on non-compulsory uniforms or wardrobes that do not fall within the definition of `occupation specific clothing' and cannot be categorised as protective clothing, can still be tax deductible. For example, tax deductions are available where the clothing designs satisfy the Occupational Clothing Guidelines and are registered by the TCFDA on the Register of Approved Occupational Clothing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an alternative, during the transitional period ending 30 June 1995, written approval of the clothing design may, in limited circumstances, be obtained from the Australian Taxation Office. The written approval will also ensure tax deductions are available to employees until 30 June 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The examples provided in the question of clothing that distinctively identifies the employee as a person associated with their employer will still be eligible for tax deductions provided that the clothing design is registered or approved as outlined above. Once the clothing is approved or registered employers who have supplied the clothing will not be subject to fringe benefits tax on that benefit. The amendments do not alter this position.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I advised Senator Campbell that the tender, to the best of my knowledge, had complied with the requirements of the public works process and it did not need to be referred, and that is correct. I am advised that the role of the project manager for the project is such that the appointment itself does not require referral to the Joint Committee on Public Works. The project manager will undertake the preliminary design work and refine cost estimates to the level of accuracy required for PWC consideration. So the appointment of the project manager is a prerequisite for PWC consideration of the project itself&mdash;that is, the actual tenders.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Primary Industries and Energy has already provided an information submission on this project to the public works committee.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), to a question without notice asked by Senator Short this day, relating to a request for extradition to Lebanon.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Bolkus, in his answers today, as he did yesterday, misled the Senate. There is no doubt at all that he misled the Senate today and that he misled the Senate yesterday. He made what appears to have been an untrue statement in response to my question yesterday. He had 24 hours to correct the impression that he had given. At the start of question time today he tried but failed totally to correct that false impression. Then, in response to the questions today that were put to him, he denied knowledge of material that he knew that he had. Indeed, we know that he had it because yesterday he quoted some irrelevant parts of it in answering my question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter goes to the heart of Australia's international relations; it goes to the heart of Australia's national security. The minister&mdash;and, I must say, Senator Gareth Evans&mdash;showed an extraordinary dereliction of duty today in terms of his knowledge, or supposed knowledge, of the involvement of his own department in it. This matter goes to the question of how certain people get into Australia&mdash;people who have subsequently been accused in the sense of warrants for their arrest being issued by the government of another country first of all for a bomb attack that killed innocent victims in a church in a town near Beirut just a few months ago. The investigations of that led to subsequent warrants for the arrest of two persons living in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday Senator Bolkus denied any knowledge of these matters, despite the fact that two days earlier&mdash;it was probably three days, because the minute is dated 24 June&mdash;he had received a briefing note from his own department that told him that the warrants for the arrest of two persons, namely Antonios Obeid and Jean Chahine, had been issued in March of this year in relation to the bombing of the church in the village near Beirut. It also told him that on 13 April this year ASIO advised that it had interviewed both of these people and `is of the opinion that it would not have been impossible for either to be involved either directly or indirectly but proof either way is likely to be difficult to find'. ASIO said that on the balance of probabilities they may not have been guilty of those charges. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But whether they are or not is irrelevant. The critical fact in all of this is that Senator Bolkus yesterday and again today attempted to portray to the Senate that he had no knowledge at all of this issue. Despite the fact of his having been asked questions initially in Senate estimate hearings last week and receiving the briefing note from his own department the following day, he denied on two successive days knowledge of matters of which he had been obviously fully aware. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the very least, these are matters of gross ministerial incompetence and dereliction of duty. But much more serious than that, they are prima facie evidence that this minister has misled this house and therefore the parliament and the Australian people on a matter of very considerable importance. He has not in way attempted to explain, nor did Senator Evans do so today, why the government is so intent on hiding the truth from the Australian people on this matter. It is a matter on which I believe the minister deserves to be censured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the material the minister has produced today. Senator Evans also is calling for further information. We will have a look at all of that then. In the meantime, it is a matter of the most grave concern, and the minister's treatment of this chamber and his misleading of it are disgraceful.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact that the minister is walking out typifies his attitude to the parliament and to these matters of major national significance. There are two areas of grave concern. Firstly, there is the matter of immigration policy and the administration of that by this minister and his predecessors. Out of a series of questions concerning immigrants from Afghanistan and Lebanon in the last few days, there must be grave doubts about whether the Australian public is being properly protected within that process. At the very least, any objective assessment of the information that has been put before this chamber could not but lead one to the conclusion that it would be justified in having grave concerns over the way those matters are being administered. That is one aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if the minister says, `We recognise that there may well be a problem here, and we are seeking to rectify it'&mdash;or whatever he might say&mdash;perhaps that is a reasonable response. As I recall, his department did make some acknowledgments about the lack of effectiveness in relation to certain Afghan immigrants. But he does not come in here and approach the matter from that point of view at all. He comes in here and seeks to hedge and hide from the whole issue. The Australian people are entitled to know about issues such as whether immigrants have come in from Lebanon; the basis upon which they have come in; the effectiveness of the security checks to the background of apparent warrants being issued for an immigrant's arrest; and concern for the slaying of a politician and his family in Lebanon. The minister does not seem to think that the Australian people are entitled to know this. That is what we find astonishing&mdash;he is hedging and hiding behind his brief. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today, the minister is still saying that he does not know anything about the extradition of Mr Obeid. It has taken him until today to acknowledge that he knows about the request for extradition of one other person. Although he had a brief before him the other day, he did not say that there had been a warrant for the arrest of Obeid. Why did he not inform the Senate of that? Are the Australian people not entitled to know that? Why did he not say it even today when he had the briefing note before him? Why did he deny that he knew that ASIO had intervened in the matter? Why is he not prepared to tell the Australian people what they are entitled to know? The Australian people are entitled to know whether there is proper protection of their interests in relation to immigration policy and, if there have been errors in that administration, what the minister is doing to rectify those errors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the fault is further compounded by what is apparently the reckless uninterest of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans) in this matter. Today, he got up and diverted the first question that was asked of him as to his knowledge of the matter to Senator Bolkus. Later in question time, he said that he thought it was referring to an Afghan matter that was raised yesterday. I do not think there was any Afghan matter raised yesterday. The matter that was raised yesterday was that concerning Antonios Obeid. The minister sought to divert it. When we specifically brought to his attention the fact that we had information that the Australian Ambassador to Lebanon had been called in to hear&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. He is uninterested in matters of this nature that the Australian people are entitled to know about. There is always a bigger issue for Senator Evans. Instead of facing up to that and telling the Senate and the Australian people frankly what is going on, Senator Evans said, `Yes, I vaguely remember that there were some matters, but I don't know the details. I'll come back to you in due course.' He was not even prepared to say today that he knew of the existence of the warrant for arrest and that he knew that the ambassador had been called in for that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans either did not know, or he should have known. At the very least, after the questions that were asked in this place yesterday Senator Evans's department should have advised him of its involvement in the matter. It is a serious matter for the Australian people and Senator Evans has failed in his responsibility. We are astonished at the attitude of Senator Bolkus. We intend to press the matter further, get to the bottom of it, find out the true facts and find out exactly what this minister and this government are hiding. </PARA>

Senator Short said that ASIO reported that the individual may not be guilty of these charges. I have some doubts and some very real concerns if Senator Short is accurately repeating what ASIO is reported to have said. That would be putting ASIO in the position of judging matters, and I do not think that is ASIO's role; nor is it the role of this chamber or illustrious senators to judge individuals. There are proper processes to do that, and that is certainly not here in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has already admitted that my first sentence is absolutely correct with regard to his attitude. As far as the second sentence is concerned, let me say that some two-thirds of his answer to the question I asked on 3 February were devoted not to the issue of the mouse plagues and the farmers' plight but to gratuitous advice to the then leader of the opposition, Dr Hewson, about how to deal with the rats, as the minister described them, in the opposition. It had absolutely nothing to do with the disastrous circumstances that the farmers were facing because of the devastating effects of the mouse plague. That is what the minister calls taking things seriously.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I raised the issue in the estimates hearings later in February the minister again treated it with levity.

He completely ignored the fact that mice can and do cross borders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, one of the major problems with the last mouse plague was the fact that the plague crossed the South Australia-Victoria border and, because the different states had different means of dealing with that plague, it was not dealt with adequately.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To assist in future decision making regarding Australia's refugee determination system, the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs monitor and keep up to date with overseas experiences and developments in relation to refugee law and processing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Asylum Section was established within the Department in 1991 to perform inter alia this precise function. Any experiences and developments overseas which may be of interest or utility in Australia are observed closely and, where appropriate, their applicability is considered in the Australian context. On the whole, however, developments have so far parallelled those in Australia. For instance, most developed countries receiving asylum seekers have chiefly responded to increased numerical pressures by increasing processing resources and attempting to set tighter time limits on processing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There be a thorough investigation into the consequences of the decision in Chan Yee Kin v Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (1989) 87 ALR 412, and that this investigation of processing primary decisions and the review of refugee claims be undertaken after a reasonable number of claims have been processed or a reasonable period of time has elapsed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in part. Detailed statistics are maintained on rates of rejection and approval of cases. The vast majority of refugee decisions has occurred after the Chan case. Various factors, which may change through time, affect refugee approval and rejection rates: for example the nationality composition of the caseload, compared to the nature and details of country information and the types of claims made. Each application is assessed on its own merits and it is not possible to quantify the impact which one factor, such as the Chan case, has on approval and rejection rates.</PARA>

It is assumed that the reference to Regulation 178(c), which appears to be incorrect, as 178(c) does not relate to refugee status applications, is intended to be a reference to Regulation 178(b) [now 7.14(b)].</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Compliance Computer System (CCS) and the DORS computer system enable the Department to report on the number of people against whom deportation orders have been signed who are subsequently granted refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The two systems can also provide data on the number of people who lodge refugee status applications after a deportation order has been signed against them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The mandatory deportation power under Section 59 of the Act, and the corresponding regulations (Regulation 7.14, formerly Regulation 178), have never been employed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CCS and DORS computer systems capture information on the number of people who lodge refugee status applications after having been located by the Department. The delay and additional expense incurred by refugee status applications being lodged after location of an illegal entrant could be calculated on a case-by-case basis.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consideration, on a group basis, of short term extensions of stay for individuals whose homes or livelihoods have been affected adversely by a major natural disaster has not been seen as appropriate. The impact of most natural disasters in terms of the immediate danger or threat to livelihood is usually short term and extensions of stay beyond the duration of visitor entry permits are required. There is scope within existing regulations, nevertheless, for individuals who have compelling reasons to extend their stay in Australia to apply for an extension. Such applications are considered on a case-by-case basis.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of granting short term extensions of temporary stay, the geographical area which is affected by the civil disorder or natural disaster, and from which the particular groups in humanitarian need originate, can be either a nation state or parts of a nation state.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of existing Temporary Entry Permit concessions (for certain people from Sri Lanka and the former Yugoslavia) it has been both inappropriate and impractical to specify in Regulations only parts of a nation state affected by civil disorder. Extensions of temporary stay have therefore been available to nationals of a nation state regardless of their location. There is in principle no disagreement with this recommendation, however, and this approach could be adopted if it were desirable and feasible in a particular situation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In cases where an extension or repeated extension of stay in excess of one year have been given, before any further permit extension is granted, the applicants ought to be expected to show not only that they are citizens of the country affected by the civil strife or natural disaster, but additionally that their homes, livelihood or families are in areas affected by the conflict or disaster, or that they would be required to return to the area affected by the disorder of disaster if returned home.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs monitors the operation of the present humanitarian arrangements closely, including the numbers of cases recommended for humanitarian consideration and the Minister's decision on such cases. It would be difficult to provide estimates of which claims of applicants in the backlog could be classified as humanitarian rather than refugee related.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a mechanism for ensuring consistency in decision making among Tribunal members, the senior member of the Refugee Review Tribunal be empowered to constitute three member panels of the Tribunal to consider at first instance cases which are complex in nature or which illustrate "model" case types.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Response</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in principle. The need for a mechanism to encourage consistency of decision making among Tribunal members is acknowledged.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A hard-copy classified database, arranged as a series of Country Files, has existed for a number of years as a basis for DORS decision making.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An electronic version of this new database is currently being developed. It is envisaged that this will be updated on a daily basis as additional information comes to hand.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accepted in part. It is accepted that formal procedures are needed to apply the exclusion and non-benefit clauses of the Refugee Convention. This issue will be addressed in the context of the  Migration Reform Act changes to come into effect on 1 September 1994. It is intended that the criteria for grant and retention of a visa on refugee related grounds will reflect the Convention based grounds of cessation and revocation of refugee protection and exclusion from the scope of the Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With effect 1 July 1993 the Refugee Review Tribunal has been established as the review body for refugee matters. The Minister is empowered under the provisions of the Migration Reform Act which came into effect 1 July 1993 to issue a certificate rendering a particular decision unreviewable by the Tribunal. Such a certificate would be issued where the Minister believes that it would be contrary to the public interest to change the decision on grounds of prejudice to the security, defence or international interests of Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The provisions in the Migration Act 1958 relating to the detention arrangements for border claimants be rewritten in a simplified and comprehensible manner. The rewritten provisions should not make legal distinctions concerning custody of border claimants based on the mode of transport which they have used to travel to Australia or their method of arrival in Australia. The rewritten provisions also should not use a variety of terms, for example prohibited entrant, prohibited person and designated person, to describe the same or similar class of persons.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This matter has been addressed in provisions of the Migration Reform Act 1992 which will come into force on 1 September 1994. A central theme of the amendments is simplification. Existing classes of persons under the Migration Act 1958 will be collapsed into two: lawful and unlawful non-citizens.

<PARA>I would like to address <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Audit report No. 43, Parliament's Right to Know</EMPHASIS>, which relates to legislation which will replace the Audit Act 1901. Of course, this matter will be debated on another occasion when the actual legislation comes before the chamber. I do not want to pre-empt much of that debate but I do want to say that there are some matters of concern expressed by the Auditor-General which I think ought to be matters of concern to the Senate. They are certainly matters of concern to me. I hope that the various committees in their work which will proceed before the legislation comes forward will make some moves which I believe are necessary if we are to have the sort of audit function that the parliament and the people of Australia deserve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One matter that was of major concern to me emerged from an extract by the Auditor-General in the report upon the financial statements prepared by the Minister for Finance for the year ended 30 June 1984, just 10 years ago. It was written by Mr K. F. Brigden and is included in this Auditor-General's report. I would like to quote a few sentences from it. What is really depressing is that 10 years further on we are not really progressing all that far in correcting a situation which is patently unsatisfactory. Mr Brigden's statement, among other things, says:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Audit independence and audit effectiveness can amount to much the same thing. If an auditor does not enjoy independence from the bodies subject to audit it will be only a matter of time before some measure of control by auditees becomes apparent. When that happens, the effectiveness of the audit process will inevitably suffer. In practical terms, impairment of the auditor's independence is synonymous with impairment of audit effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is timely to question whether the independence of the Auditor-General and the Australian Audit Office from the executive arm of government is not more apparent than real.</PARA>
<PARA>That is certainly the situation now in spades. Mr Brigden then went on to say something which I think is of major significance when we have to make decisions about the role the Department of Finance, a key element of the executive government, should have in determining the resources available to the Auditor-General. That is one area where I believe the government's response to the need to improve the audit situation falls down. This is what Mr Brigden said 10 years ago today:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the agencies subject to audit are the Department of Finance and the Public Service Board.</PARA>
<PARA>The board does not exist anymore, but let us concentrate on the Department of Finance. Mr Brigden continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing arrangements these bodies can, and do, effectively exercise a substantial measure of control over the operations of the Audit Office through the imposition of resource restraints.</PARA>
<PARA>These restraints are adversely affecting the capacity and capability of the audit office to fulfil its statutory obligations. It is against that background that I refer to pages 39 to 41 of this audit report where the Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One cloud on the horizon is the thrust of continuing erosion of the AAO's audit mandate through modification of the statutory requirement that public enterprises be audited by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA>That is quite apart from the question of whether departments which have an effective control over the Auditor-General are then in fact audited by the Auditor-General. Quite apart from that question is the question of the public enterprises to be audited by the Auditor-General. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That, in turn, cannot be ruled out, given a perception by several auditees that audit by a company auditor would be less rigorous than audit by the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA>It may well be that there could be some enthusiastic pressure to get rid of the Auditor-General as an auditor for these government agencies. In my view, the new arrangements&mdash;which, as I recall, require both houses of parliament to support the proposition&mdash;that government business enterprises should be audited only by the Auditor-General if both houses of parliament decide it, is an unwise suggestion. This brings me back to the key point made by Mr Brigden. The Auditor-General states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of even more concern is the lack of assurance that the AAO will be adequately resourced. This concern relates both to the overall level of resources, and to the problem of retention of experienced professionals in a salary structure grossly out of tune with the market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The salary problem&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>as the Senate will recognise&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">relates particularly to senior executive and senior professional levels.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is worth pointing out that the maximum salary of a director of audit is $43,000 a year, compared with salaries ranging up to and beyond $60,000 a year for audit managers doing similar jobs in large firms in the private sector. In other words, there is a definite need for the Auditor-General to have a level of flexibility in order to maintain a qualified and competent work force capable of examining matters in a way that the parliament would need. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General makes the point that when the audit office sought to increase its capacity through technological upgrading, in order to carry out effective audits, the Department of Finance took a particularly negative view of the whole proposal, saying basically that if any technological improvements came in they should be offset by staff production. So there was to be no improvement, no expansion in the capacity of the Auditor-General to do his job in the face of restraints and constraints that have been proceeding over the last 10 years, particularly at the hands, it seems to me, of the Department of Finance. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there seemed little comprehension of the significance of the principle of the independence of the Auditor-General from the executive arm of government.</PARA>
<PARA>That relates not just to the Department of Finance but overall. As the Auditor-General points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For some three months during the lead-up to the Budget . . . officers of the Department of Finance persistently sought to have the AAO transform its information technology proposals into a cost-saving exercise such that staff cuts be made to an extent offsetting the recurrent costs of the acquisition. This was said to be in pursuit of a new policy, application of which to all computer acquisitions was mandatory, so that no exception could be allowed.</PARA>
<PARA>That was obviously an absurd situation which was corrected. The problem is, as the Auditor-General says, that the whole situation seems to be a usurpation of the Auditor-General's statutory responsibility to determine the manner in which the audit function is exercised. That Department of Finance advice, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . .  taken with the tenor of the budgetary proceedings, amounts to an attempt . . . to impose resource restrictions `which would constrain the (AAO's) exercise of its mandate' and which hence `would be an appropriate matter for report by the AAO to the legislature'. In conformity with those Standards . . . I address this issue in this Report.</PARA>
<PARA>These are basic matters of serious principle, in my view. As the Auditor-General says in the summary of his report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accountability to the elected representatives is the cornerstone of democracy and the Westminster system of government. The currency of accountability is information. The Parliament has long relied on the reports of Auditors-General as a source of apolitical, independent and objective advice. If an Auditor-General's capacity is limited by resource or other constraints, the Parliament is deprived of information on the performance of the public sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1989&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is more than five years ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Joint Committee of Public Accounts . . . in its Report 296 concluded that there were substantial weaknesses in the capacity of the Auditor-General and the Australian National Audit Office . . . as then constituted, to play their part in the process of accountability to the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>I commend my fellow senators, particularly Senator John Watson, for the remarkable amount of effort they have put into this matter of endeavouring to reform the whole system of the Auditor-General and his relationship with the executive when it should be the Auditor-General and his relationship with the parliament. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee said the ANAO, at a minimum, could be described as having major problems and, at a maximum, was in a state of crisis. This resulted from a dulling of the Parliament's capacity to perceive that the ANAO had difficulties and an ambiguous relationship with the Executive which had led to Parliamentary and Government neglect.</PARA>
<PARA>This was all five years ago. At last the government has come back with some recommendations, some of which I support strongly, and I hope they are carried into effect. But, contrary to the committee's recommendations and contrary to the concerns expressed by the Senate more recently, the bills do not address the following key issues which the Auditor-General has pointed out, in particular the position of the Auditor-General and the audit office as against the executive. According to the Auditor-General:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Committee recommended the Auditor-General be an Officer of the Parliament and the ANAO become a statutory authority with the authority to determine the terms and conditions of employment of staff. The Auditor-General Bill establishes the ANAO as a statutory authority, but does not provide the Auditor-General with authority to determine the terms and conditions of employment of staff. The statutory authority model proposed will provide few, if any, tangible benefits to the ANAO.</PARA>
<PARA>Another failure is that the Auditor-General recommended that the Auditor-General should be the sole external auditor of all Commonwealth agencies. As I said earlier, while this is true of the departments, the Auditor-General Bill enables the Auditor-General to conduct performance audits in government business enterprises only if both houses of the parliament, by resolution, request the audit, or at the request of the responsible minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question of concern is missing out on implementing the recommendation of greater parliamentary involvement in the funding activities of the audit office through the establishment of an audit committee of the parliament. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Auditor-General Bill makes no provision for an Audit Committee. The Government has proposed the Audit Committee be established by a resolution of the Parliament. This would not give the audit committee essential stability and permanence.</PARA>
<PARA>The other concern is that the parliament, as the client of the audit office, should bear the cost of all audit fees, ceasing the practice of individual auditees paying fees. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Auditor-General Bill has the effect of continuing existing arrangements whereby individual auditees, except agencies, pay fees to the ANAO for all financial statement audits. While the ANAO supports an audit fee regime, the collection of audit fees by the ANAO should not determine future ANAO funding. The Parliament should fund the public sector auditor.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that very strongly. It is clearly important to have the person paying the fee being the person who wants to have a thorough, proper audit report. That person is, of course, the parliament. The Auditor-General has welcomed the government's recognition of the need for an audit committee, even if it is not in the form it wants. I conclude by quoting from the Auditor-General's report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The risks facing the public sector (and therefore the Auditor-General) have increased enormously since Report 296&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which, as I said, was five years ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">but the ANAO has not obtained the assistance and support necessary to ensure it remains viable and effective in that changed environment. In not matching the risks seen in 1989, the Bills fall short of the legislative basis adopted in international and Australian state reforms which were seen by the Committee&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is five years ago&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">as necessary for a viable and effective Auditor-General. Overall the proposals miss the opportunity to set the standard for public accountability and model arrangements for the operation of the ANAO which would serve the Parliament, the Government and the community well into the 21st century. Ultimately, under such circumstances, the Parliament and the community will be the losers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report then outlines the matters that he respectfully suggests require the parliament's consideration. I do hope the parliament will give proper and due consideration to those matters. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the Senate follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. More recently the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise today to support the tabling of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs inquiry into breast cancer screening and treatment in Australia. It is with a great sense of expectation and hope that the committee delivered its report to the Senate for consideration. There are very few diseases in the annals of medicine that reap such an horrific human harvest as breast cancer. It is a profound national and international problem. It terrifies each and every woman, and it should be a concern of each and every man.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1990s so far there have been more than 70,000 Australian women diagnosed with this disease, 25,000 deaths and statistically over half a million years of life lost. To quote a recent article in an Australian women's magazine, if news bulletins announced breast cancer deaths the way they report the road toll there would be a national outcry. In monetary terms the total cost to Australia during this decade is estimated to be over $2 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Breast cancer is not a new disease; it has been well documented for over 5,000 years, but this year it will continue to kill 2,500 Australian women. This equates to six women a day or one woman every four hours. Breast cancer affects one in 15 Australian women at some stage in their lives, and trends from the United States suggest that it may be as high as one woman in 12 as the decade wears on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Potential lifestyle factors determining this increase require further research, and this is starting to be done. Between 1977 and 1989, the incidence of breast cancer in New South Wales rose 21 per cent. Sadly, neither the cause of breast cancer nor the means of preventing it are known. The major initiatives required to address this epidemic are screening for early detection and easier access to high quality treatment. Educating women is also of vital importance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be effective in reducing mortality, the national program for the early detection of breast cancer needs to achieve a high participation rate in the high-risk age groups&mdash;that is determined to be the 50- to 69-year-old women. A report of the screening evaluation coordination unit estimated that if 70 per cent of women aged between 40 and 69 years participated in the program there would be a 16 per cent reduction in mortality amongst Australian sufferers. Based on overseas studies, individual women participating regularly in quality mammographic screening can anticipate a 60 per cent reduction in the risk of death from breast cancer. The factors reducing death rates include not only regular mammography screening but also the provision of quality diagnostic screening and assessment services by multidisciplinary specialist teams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Breast cancer is likely to have an impact on every one of us during our lifetimes. We all have mothers, sisters, aunts, nieces and colleagues. In my local city of Tamworth, a successful businesswoman I know, Bev Barnsley, has had two encounters with this terrifying disease in the space of 14 years. Bev was a 43-year-old mother in 1980 when she was found to have a small cancerous lump in her breast. It was surgically removed. Then in 1987 the unthinkable happened and a second cancer was discovered through Bev's annual mammography screening. This time she underwent a mastectomy. Bev said, `I believe because I had a mammogram I am alive today.' She continued, `I really don't give much thought to my cancer now in reference to myself. I don't drop my guard but I look forward.' She looks forward with hope and help from regular screening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure my colleagues will join with me in wishing a quick recovery to former shadow health minister Senator Jocelyn Newman, somebody we all hold dear. Senator Newman lobbied hard in this place for increased breast cancer funding and should be applauded for her tireless efforts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this year's budget the government, to its credit, provided extra funds for the continuation and expansion of the national screening program. An amount of $93 million was provided for health and medical research&mdash;not specifically for breast cancer&mdash;and the government tells us that increased funding for breast cancer research projects is expected to result. I think this means that, if breast cancer research applications are not considered to be good enough, there will be no funding. The proposed annual $2 million funding for a national breast cancer centre may have been better spent on tax deductibility for private donations to existing research foundations. I commend the government for its additional funds, however; I think it is going in the right direction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the New South Wales government's decision to spend $4.5 million to fast-track breast cancer screening programs. I call on the federal government to match this commitment so that by June 1996 screening services can be available across the whole of New South Wales to women in the high-risk age range of 50 to 69. Some of the services will be new centres for screening while others will be mobile or relocatable units. As well, the New South Wales government will fund four new minibuses to move around the state helping women in isolated areas to have access to these services. This is important as rural women often miss out on services because of their geographic isolation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already New South Wales has provided free screening to more women than any other state. In 1988 there was no population based screening service in New South Wales: now, thanks to the joint federal and state government funding, we have seven screening and assessment services providing screening services through 29 fixed and mobile screening facilities. That brings me to the north and north-west breast screening service which operates in the Tamworth and the north-west region. This service began a screening and assessment service in the New England and north-west slopes area in March 1991. In true country style the service was initiated by community action stimulated by the Rotary Club of Glen Innes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales government agreed to the provision of recurrent funding to support the operation of a dedicated mobile breast screening unit. The total cost of the unit was then $300,000. Fundraising in areas around Tamworth assisted in developing a breast disease diagnostic clinic and health service at Tamworth Base Hospital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The service was evaluated as a pilot program for rural New South Wales in conjunction with the New England public health unit. The community again supported the service by raising funds for the expansion of the screening unit and assessment centre in Tamworth. Most of the funds for this expansion have come by way of the NBN telethon, and many individuals, community groups and business organisations throughout the region have made specific contributions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at May of this year the service had provided over 12,000 initial screening mammograms to women in 20 local government areas in the screening area. Of these, nearly 6,500, or 52 per cent, are in the target age group of 50- to 69-year-olds. Fifty-three cancers have been detected at initial screenings at a rate of 4.3 per 1,000 women. This rate is a little below the national average but that is only because of the higher number of women below 50 who have been given access to the screening facility. A further nine cancers have so far been detected at the second round of screening. Six interval cancers are known to have been detected symptomatically within 12 months of screening. This indicates that screening is not a catch-all but it is a great help. This is a groundbreaking service that serves as an example for all rural and regional areas in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I urge the Senate to seriously consider each of our recommendations. The report contains many important recommendations, including that strategies be implemented to improve access to the program in rural and remote areas. This could involve financial assistance to help women access the program. Additionally, the focus of the program remains on women aged between 50 and 69, but the committee made clear that mammographic screening should continue to be available to women aged 40 to 49 and of course to those over 70 years of age. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is not time available to go into the detail of the basis of the report or its recommendations. Suffice it to say that it is about time that attention is focused on this very serious problem. Senator Sandy Macdonald indicated that the government has provided a certain amount for medical research. I have had a look at some of the projects that the government has provided funds for. On my first look at them I found that there are many questionable areas that the government is looking at. Indeed, some are questionable on the basis of ethics. The money that is going into some of those programs could be better utilised for the purposes of putting more funding into research of the breast cancer problem, the matters surrounding it and indeed the management of the problem when it is faced not only by women but also by the other people directly involved&mdash;their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had a very strong and personal interest in this matter for 15 years. I am happy to see that at least there is now full recognition of the importance of this problem and the effect that it has not only on the individual who has the disease&mdash;which is a real problem&mdash;but also on everyone else involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Medical interventions are not the only or, indeed, the primary means of overcoming and facing up to this particular problem. I do not suggest that medical interventions are the total answer. Nevertheless, it is important that research funds be made available for an all-out attack on this problem. It has been said here, although I have not said it myself, and it has been my personal observation, that the money that has been thrown at AIDS&mdash;a very serious disease, but one which predominantly affects male homosexuals&mdash;has been very substantial but, had AIDS primarily affected females, one wonders whether so much money would have been thrown at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the money is well spent; much of it is not well spent. Having been on the Parliamentary AIDS Liaison Committee, I have had occasion to point out some of the areas where money for AIDS has not been well spent&mdash;where the educational programs have encouraged the practices which are the substantial cause of the spread of the disease, rather than the money being utilised properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rose just to mention that. I thank Senator Sandy Macdonald and the other members of the committee for the work that they have done. I believe that the committee system has great advantages in this place. I am a very strong supporter of the committee system. It is important that reports such as this and the others that have been referred to today are read. I will be looking forward to a response by the government. I also take this opportunity to say, as did Senator Sandy Macdonald, that we are all thinking of Senator Jocelyn Newman. Our prayers are with her and her family. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principal aim of this legislation is to provide a real, and enforceable, deterrent to the sexual abuse of children outside Australia by Australian citizens and residents. It is unfortunate that a minority of Australian citizens and residents are now known internationally as major offenders in several Asian countries. They exploit the vulnerability of children in foreign countries where laws against child sexual abuse may not be as strict, or as consistently enforced, as in Australia. The Bill aims to ensure that cowardly crimes committed against children outside Australia, which are not prosecuted in the country in which they were committed, can be prosecuted effectively in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also focuses on the activities of those who promote, organise and profit from child sex tourism. Provided they operate from Australia, or have a relevant link with Australia, they, too, will be able to be prosecuted for their contribution to the abuse of foreign children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some may wonder why the Australian Parliament should enact laws to protect foreign children from sexual abuse, and ask why the foreign country should not protect its own children. It is true that the primary responsibility for protecting children from sexual exploitation rests, as it should, with the countries where the children are exploited. The Asian countries which are chiefly involved are indeed taking measures to do so, but are confronted by social and economic factors which make their task difficult. They welcome any assistance in curbing the trade in children's bodies that other governments can give. Some other countries have already enacted, or plan to enact, legislation similar to that which is now before you.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from the fact that Australia is gaining an unenviable reputation in the world press on this issue, we also have international obligations to protect children, whatever their nationality. Australia ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child on 17 December 1990, and this imposes an obligation to protect children, at both the national and the international level, from sexual exploitation and abuse. Australia played a key role in the development of the Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Australian Government is committed to pursuing the aims of that Convention. The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, Mr Brian Burdekin, has been asked to prepare a draft protocol to the Convention specifically addressing the problems of child prostitution and other forms of abuse and sexual exploitation of children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Minister for Justice indicated in his address to the First World Congress on Family Law and Children's Rights in Sydney on 4 July 1993, it is clear from the recent World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, that children's rights are high on the international agenda. That conference highlighted the need to develop effective and independent international machinery to ensure that abuses of children's rights are identified and that tangible measures are taken to remedy those abuses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill aims to achieve these ends by creating sexual offences, relating to conduct outside Australia, which will be punishable in Australia, and offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism, which may be committed in or out of Australia, and will be punishable in Australia provided there is a relevant link with this country. All these offences will have substantial penalties, ranging from 12 to 17 years imprisonment, or correspondingly high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill should send a clear message to child sex abusers and those who profit from their activities that the Government and the community condemn their behaviour and do not intend to tolerate it. The Bill has the support of all Australian jurisdictions through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. State and Territory jurisdictions not only support the Commonwealth measures, but will enact any necessary or desirable supplementary legislation to close any perceived gaps and to ensure that the measures are effective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some changes have been made to the Bill as a result of the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The Government expresses its appreciation of that Committee's work and has adopted most of its recommendations. The major changes are, first, the collapsing of the standard and aggravated sexual offences into single offences against children under 16 years. That involves the amendment of the age of the child in proposed sections 50BA, 50BC, 50BE and 50BG  to read `a person  who is under 16' and the deletion of proposed sections 50BB, 50BD, 50BF and 50BH.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government agrees that a potential gap in the legislation could arise because of the probability that birth records in many of the countries where child sexual exploitation occurs may be incomplete. As the Committee is aware, the same problem arises in relation to sexual offences under State legislation upon which the Bill's provisions are partly based, but is insignificant because of Australia's universal birth records which establish age precisely. As recommended, the maximum penalties are retained for the merged offences, and proposed section 50FE has been inserted providing that, in sentencing a person convicted of an offence under the Part, the court must take the age and maturity of the complainant into account. These considerations are additional to the matters which must be taken into account under subsection 16A(2) of the Crimes Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major change is the removal of the belief in the child's consent requirement form the defences. That requirement was included out of a concern to protect persons under the age of 16 (from conduct by Australians) where the perpetrator either does not believe the person is under the age of 16 or does not believe the person consents to the conduct. The absence of a consent requirement could allow an individual to escape liability merely because he or she believed the person was over 16, irrespective of the fact that the evidence disclosed that the child had been raped or was forced to commit indecent acts. It was not a novel requirement. Consent is a requirement of the reasonable mistake defence available in respect of similar offences under some State laws where the elements of the defence are consent and mistaken belief in age and reasonableness. However, the Government has decided to give weight to the concerns expressed by the Committee and remove consent as an element of the defences. The Government will monitor the operation of the provisions with a view to making appropriate amendments in the future, if required.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are further offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism, carrying a maximum penalty of 17 years imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, there are some aspects of the Bill that I would like to draw to your attention. The intention has been to strike the correct balance between the need to minimise the enforcement difficulties that always arise where overseas evidence is required, and which are exacerbated when child witnesses are involved, and the need to ensure that the rights of the defendant receive a similar degree of protection as would apply if the offence had been committed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation must be more than mere window-dressing. The Government is concerned to see that it is practically enforceable, as it must be if it is to have the deterrent effect for which we have aimed. However, while the Government is determined to achieve this, it will not do so by compromising the defendant's right to the protection of the usual rules of evidence and procedure&mdash;to the traditional rights and privileges and defences which would have applied if the conduct alleged had occurred within an Australian jurisdiction and not in a foreign country. There will inevitably be some differences in the procedural and evidentiary framework of these offences from that which applies to similar State and Territory offences. These are needed to accommodate the international aspect of the enforcement process, but there are none which do not already occur in Australia in an age of increasing internationalisation of many offences, and none which will operate unfairly to the defendant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will now outline the features of the Bill which may call for further explanation, particularly as this subject matter, sexual offences, is unusual in a Commonwealth Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, the age of consent is the factor which creates the difference between the freedom to conduct one's personal life as one wishes and the commission of the criminal offence of child sexual abuse. On this point such offences are offences of strict liability, in this Bill and in all Australian States and Territories, whether code or common law jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within Australia, the age of consent varies among jurisdictions, and overseas the range of variability is even greater. The Convention on the Rights of the Child sets the age at 18 years. However, most Australian jurisdictions have chosen 16 as the appropriate age, and that is the age which I consider appropriate in the present circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two statutory defences are provided in relation to the sexual offences.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first is a defence of mistaken belief in the age of the child, that is, a belief that the child was 16 years or over at the time of the offence. The belief test is a subjective one, based on what the person actually believed, though in determining whether the person actually held that belief the jury is entitled to take into account whether the claimed belief is reasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second defence is that of a valid and genuine marriage between the accused and the alleged victim. This defence has a further element:  the requirement that the defendant satisfy the jury, on the balance of probabilities, that a formally valid marriage is also genuine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This requirement is to avoid deliberate abuse of the availability of the marriage defence to defeat the legislation. Marriages celebrated in foreign countries, where one of the parties is under 18 years, are generally not recognisable in Australia. Nevertheless, it is quite possible that an Australian citizen or resident who came to Australia from a foreign country, or whose parents did so, might return to that country to marry according to its customs. The government has no intention, in multicultural Australia, of rendering any such person vulnerable to conviction for a criminal offence on returning to Australia. That would be an entirely different matter from simply not recognising the marriage. But in Australia, the formal validity of a marriage is proved, prima facie, by production of a marriage certificate. It would not be difficult, particularly in countries where poverty and corruption are widespread, for paedophiles to obtain marriage certificates which would preclude their conviction of child sexual abuse offences, if the marriage defence did not place an onus on them to satisfy the jury, on the balance of probabilities, of the genuineness of the marriage. Courts have some experience of dealing with a requirement for proof of genuineness of a marriage because it features in immigration law, which could similarly be circumvented by non-genuine marriages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defences provided in the Bill place both the evidential and the persuasive onus of proof on the defendant to satisfy the jury on the balance of probabilities that a defence is made out, are contrary to the principle that the prosecution must prove every element of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. However, the offences are proved by the prosecution satisfying the jury, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the accused committed the prohibited acts with a child of the relevant age. The child's marital status or the belief as to the age of the child are not elements of the offence. The defences are true defences, providing a means of exculpation for the accused, and the matters required to be proved, to the civil standard, are matters peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused. Therefore, it is appropriate for the onus of proving them to rest on him or her, rather than that the prosecution should be forced to undertake the difficult task of proving negatives beyond a reasonable doubt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is unable to accept the Committee's criticism that the defences depart unreasonably from `traditional safeguards' or `throws aside 200 years of criminal justice with fairness for the accused'. These extreme statements appear to be largely based on a misunderstanding of the law in Australia as it relates to sexual offences against children and the available defences. Under the law of sexual offences involving children across the Australian jurisdictions, it is for the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence, but a defence is allowed as to the accused's belief (reasonable  belief in some jurisdictions) which is a matter for the accused to establish on the balance of probabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill follows this approach, and the government holds to the view that the general structure of the offences and defences in the Bill is appropriate. The proposed section is in accordance with judicial authority and with equivalent State legislation; see, for example, R v Douglas [1985] VR 721 and Heath, Indictable Offences in Victoria, 1992, at p.351 and the authorities cited therein. As both the former and the current Presidents of the Australian Law Reform Commission pointed out to the Committee, it is within normal standards to require the defence to establish belief in age on the balance of probabilities (a point also made by the Law Faculty of the University of New South Wales and by the Attorney-General of South Australia in their submissions to the Committee).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, unlike its counterparts under state legislation, proposed section 50CA currently only requires a subjective belief to be proven on the balance of probabilities. It would be extremely difficult for the prosecution to negate beyond a reasonable doubt an assertion of what was in the mind of the accused at the time of the alleged offence, especially when what may be asserted need not be reasonable or rational and when intoxication can be used to assist a defence of mistaken belief. As Justice Elizabeth Evatt noted knowledge of age&mdash;a matter peculiarly within the knowledge of the accused&mdash;is not an element of the offences which must be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt.  I note that the Senate Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills also had no difficulty with the proposed section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me now move to the offences of encouraging or benefiting from child sex tourism. These offences are required because the usual ancillary offences of aiding and abetting, counselling, procuring and being knowingly concerned in the commission of a substantive offence would not suffice to catch the promoter, organiser or advertiser of a child sex tour. That is because those offences depend on the commission of a particular offence to which the promoter, organiser or advertiser would have to be directly and knowingly linked. This would not usually be possible when he or she is remote in time and place from any specific child sexual offence. Possibly the ancillary offence of incitement could be committed, since it does not require the actual commission of a particular, or, indeed, any, offence, but the penalty for incitement is only 12 months imprisonment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that the intentional acts of encouraging or benefiting from the sexual abuse of defenceless children in foreign countries, whether or not any specific offence with a particular child is contemplated, must be prosecutable, and must be punishable by a substantial penalty, in this case a maximum of 17 years imprisonment, similar to the more serious primary offences. This is an indictable offence and will attract the confiscation and forfeiture provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987, which should provide a powerful deterrent to any business enterprises which have been profiting from knowingly facilitating child sex tours. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There remain two more matters that I wish to mention to you. These relate to the conduct of the trial and arise from the difficulties that are associated with prosecuting offences committed outside Australia. I am determined that the legislation will provide every opportunity, consistent with fairness, for evidence to be made available to the jury, despite the fact that in many cases it will be evidence from a foreign country, where records may not be kept in the same comprehensive manner as in Australia and where the ability of investigators and the court to use coercive powers to obtain evidence and to compel the attendance of witnesses is severely curtailed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first of these is a provision which, where the age of a child cannot be determined by the usual means, allows the jury to estimate the age of the child, taking into account whatever evidence is available, such as the evidence of relatives and the child's appearance and demeanour. This provision has been amended in accordance with the recommendation of the House of Representatives Committee. It is not without precedent. It is based on section 411 of the Crimes Act 1958 of Victoria. I would expect it to have the most relevance, not in borderline cases where the defence of a mistaken belief in the age of the child would be expected to prevail, but in cases where the child was obviously well within the prohibited range. It would serve the purpose of preventing an accused from evading punishment  completely because of the lack of documentary evidence of age.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second is the provision for the use of video link so that overseas evidence can be presented to a court in Australia. Video link has already been used effectively in major trials in Australia, including one of the war crimes trials.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed sections as originally introduced, required the judge, in certain prescribed circumstances, to direct that the technology be used, provided its use was not contrary to the interests of justice. This was intended to overcome the costs and difficulties for both the defence and the prosecution in securing the attendance of witnesses from overseas or using material taken overseas in deposition form. They were also intended to reduce the trauma of the victim of appearing in court. Proposed subsection 50EB(2) was intended to reflect a clear intention that, in the absence of compelling reasons to the contrary, the defence and the prosecution should be allowed to seek the use of video link technology where the circumstances listed in proposed paragraphs 50EB(1)(a),(b) and (c) were met.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The present provision adopts the Committee's recommendation by combining the sections into one provision, removing the mandatory formulation and providing that any direction for the use of the technology in a particular case must be consistent with the interests of justice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers that these provisions strike the correct balance. It is increasingly the trend in Australian jurisdictions to spare children who have been victims of sexual abuse the trauma and the ordeal of appearing in the witness box in the intimidating atmosphere of the court. Even in Australia, it is frequently the case that the jury views the child's examination and cross-examina2CHAPtion by means of video. The fact that the child itself is in a distant country rather than a nearby room may pose some problems for the court and for counsel that might not arise when the evidence is taken in close proximity to the court room, but none, I believe that cannot be overcome. My expectation is that the use of satellite and communications technology, where that is available, can be used to approximate conditions comparable to those which can already occur in some Australian jurisdictions. If, in a particular case, the judge forms the view that the use of video link would be contrary to the interests of justice, he or she is not compelled to direct its use.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Government wishes to recognise a concern expressed in relation to the practical operation of the proposed legislation raised by Senator Spindler. The Senator's concern relates to the possibility that laws of States and Territories providing for the taking of children's evidence by closed circuit television, in order to spare them unnecessary trauma, may not apply to proceedings under the proposed legislation  The Government is seeking legal advice on whether any of the relevant State laws would not be picked up and applied to the proceedings by the operation of section 68 or section 79 of the Judiciary Act 1903. If the advice indicates that the relevant provisions are not applied in all Australian jurisdictions, the Government will make the necessary amendments to the Part as soon as a suitable legislative vehicle is available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is not anticipated that the Bill will occasion any additional costs to the Government. The costs of any prosecutions will come from the budgetary allocations for the Australian Federal Police and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, which will conduct investigations and prosecutions under the proposed legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that the proposed legislation achieves the challenging task of ensuring both enforceability and fairness in the prosecution process for offences committed overseas which are known to be difficult to prosecute even when committed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

We made the point at that time that it was important that the standards of justice to which Australians have become entitled should not be let slip by the desire of this government to act quickly with respect to paedophiles. It is all very well to have the intention to do the right thing so long as, in a rush to do so, one does not put at risk other people's rights and in that way do the right thing. </PARA>

On an earlier occasion I took the opportunity to chastise Mr Daryl Melham, the Labor chairman of the committee, for saying that he thought his committee was the premier committee of the parliament.

I do not think that experience will be too far away, but that is another matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is that they have done a good job. Whether or not it is the case when we are in government, this fact is correct: taxpayers do expect members of parliament to do their job. They do expect members of parliament, when they think a bill is either wrong in principle or wrong in some detail, but the principle is right&mdash;which was the situation here&mdash;to try to fix the bill. For once, the House of Representatives has taken on this task and, I have to say, it has done a pretty good job of it. As I said, it was we who indicated that this should be done. I freely admit that other parties in this chamber may well have supported that move, if they had had the chance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to make is this: the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), quite rightly, has picked up the cost of justice agenda. He has done so too late, but better late than never. He has taken just about every opportunity to chastise the legal profession and blame them for the high cost of justice. He has, on very few occasions that I can turn my mind to, acknowledged the role that government plays. I do not mean by that just his government; I mean the role that all of us play by adding to the pile of legislation daily, because that means that, when a taxpayer needs some legal advice, he has to pay someone to wade through the myriad legislation and regulations that we churn out of this place, to find out what the law is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We keep contributing to that. Maybe that would not be a bad thing if we kept contributing to it and got it right each time. I hope in this case by the time the legislation leaves this parliament we will have got this bill right. But one fact stares at us as clear as a bell: the government, in its desire to rush this legislation through, put a piece of legislation into the House of Representatives that was nothing short of appalling. If we go through the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> transcripts and look at the submissions made to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which looked at this bill, we find that witness after witness said, `Great ideal, but you're going about it in the wrong way. You are putting the rights of individual citizens at risk in the name of pursuing your ideal. You haven't got your legislation right in the first place.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to make the point that one way in which the executive can contribute to the parliament as a whole getting things right in the first place is by itself taking more time in framing the legislation in the first place&mdash;putting out exposure drafts and getting some broader consultation, so that we do not have to spend as much time and money fixing the legislation here. We spend a lot of time and money. These hearings are expensive, not only for the taxpayer but for the people who come along and contribute, many of whom pay their own air fares, give up their own professional time to draft submissions, submit them to a hearing and then come along and make a verbal submission as well. That all costs. We have had enormous costs in this regard. This committee had three public hearings&mdash;on 18, 19 and 23 May. The bill was referred to it on only 4 May and it was meant to report, I think, by 30 May. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the report of the committee indicated that if the bill were to be passed in its original form there would have been grave encroachments into the presumption of innocence. In the foreword to the report, the chairman of the committee, Mr Melham, indicated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Parliament accepts the recommendations made by the Committee in this report, the Bill will be a much clearer and more effective piece of legislation. It will provide a stronger deterrent than the current draft and it will be enforceable. The protection offered to children in countries outside Australia will be more powerful.</PARA>
<PARA>Why could the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) not get his act together and get the bill into the form in which we have it now when he introduced it in the first place? Would it not be a contribution to the cost of justice and access to justice if ministers and their departments spent a bit more time getting the drafting right in the first place? It certainly would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have indicated, there were about 37 recommendations made. The government was forced to accept almost all of them. This bill, in one sense, is something that we should all be proud of because it is going to make a contribution to protecting children from paedophiles. We can all take some pride in that when this bill is passed. But the minister who originally drafted this bill has the pride that he can take in it tainted in one way, because the bill was introduced in such a sloppy and basically disgraceful way in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about people going to gaol. They are quite serious crimes that we are constructing, and quite serious penalties on possibly innocent citizens. In the name of pursuing an ideal, the minister drafted a bill that needed very serious amending which was agreed to by his own party in the other place before we even had a chance to look at it. The recommendations that were made were to tighten the provisions for video link, and the provisions which would have otherwise made it possible for the court to establish the age of the victim. That was a very serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee indicated in its report that the bill, in its original form, did not effectively translate intentions into sound legislation. The committee indicated that the bill's response to the problems of procuring evidence and prosecuting a case had been to short-circuit some of the traditional safeguards afforded to accused persons in Australia. How disgraceful is that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter how bad the crime is. In fact, it should be said that the time when the right of presumption of innocence should be most closely protected is when the charge is more serious. That is obviously the case. The more serious the charge, the more closely protected the presumption of innocence should be. This committee basically said that the original bill wanted to short-circuit some of the traditional safeguards afforded to accused persons in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr John Dowd QC indicated that fairness for the accused is also fairness for the community. Mr Martin Sides QC, who gave evidence at the hearing, indicated that the right of the accused to a fair trial is paramount. What in heaven's name are we doing when we have ministers producing legislation that requires QCs to come and tell parliamentarians that fairness for the accused is fairness for the community and that we need to remember that the right of the accused to a fair trial is paramount? Should we not know that in the first place? Should legislation not be introduced in a form that indicates that we understand that? Every citizen in this nation, when they are charged with a crime under Commonwealth or state legislation, has the right to a fair trial, and that is a paramount right. There is no right that should be able to overstep that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, we had a minister who&mdash;perhaps in a genuine desire to address this problem rapidly, or perhaps in a desire to catch the publicity that would flow from dealing with this legislation&mdash;cobbled together a tacky piece of legislation that required 37 recommendations for amendments to be made. He put the federal parliament&mdash;allegedly the highest court in the land&mdash;in a situation where we had QCs reminding us that our own citizens had a right to a fair trial and we ought not to forget it. How embarrassing is that for us? We can take some pride in the fact that this legislation will pass, but the minister can take no pride at all in the form in which he originally put this bill into the lower house&mdash;not one skerrick of pride. It is just a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would be embarrassed to be the minister and have these kinds of remarks made about a piece of legislation that I put forward. I would be embarrassed to have people telling a parliamentary committee that I put in legislation that seemed to forget that the right of Australian citizens to a fair trial was paramount. It is a fundamental disgrace to have legislation originally put in that form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that other people want to speak on this bill. Were we not pressed for time&mdash;as we always are at the end of the session&mdash;I would go through the legislation piece by piece and further elaborate on the disgraceful condition in which this bill was first put to the House of Representatives. But I suppose fair is fair. Some of it has been fixed up by the committee and it deserves credit for having done that. I would like to go through the legislation piece by piece and point out where the minister had allowed a bill to come in, in his desire to address this matter, in such a tacky form that the paramount right of Australians to a fair trial was put at risk. That is just a disgrace. I will not say any more because I think other people might want to contribute to this debate. We will let the debate get under way so that this bill can be passed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Senate is discussing the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994. The bill is before the Senate against the backdrop of the incidence of child prostitution in developing countries, which is increasing at an alarming rate. In India there may be as many as 400,000 child prostitutes; in the Philippines perhaps as many as 375,000; in Sri Lanka perhaps 20,000; in Taiwan perhaps 90,000; and in Thailand the estimates range from 200,000 to 800,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The human consequences of these figures in terms of suffering, loss of childhood and infection with AIDS is appalling. As has been well publicised, Australian tourists have been prominent amongst those who have engaged in this terrible exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, this bill is most welcome. No-one is saying that this legislation will put an end to child prostitution. The causes of child prostitution do not lend themselves to a quick legislative solution. Apart from the predatory sexual instincts of paedophile tourists, other factors exacerbate the problem: the extreme economic imbalance between north and south; poverty and chronic unemployment in countries like Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Philippines; political instability; the large number of paedophiles in local communities; lack of police action; and, it must be said, official complicity in child exploitation in those countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite these hurdles the bill will, I believe, be effective in addressing the problem to a substantial extent. Firstly, it will cut the sex tourism industry off at its source by eliminating the demand for child prostitution amongst Western tourists&mdash;or at least reduce it. Secondly, the legislation will serve an important educative role. It will send a clear message to Australian paedophiles and those who would encourage or assist them in their activities that their actions will attract severe punishment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats recognise that prosecutions under the legislation will not be a straight forward exercise. Quite apart from the inherent difficulty involved in prosecuting cases involving allegations of child sexual abuse, there will be additional problems with prosecutions under this legislation. It will not be easy to obtain evidence against the paedophile. Australian police will be reliant on the cooperation of local police forces even when mutual assistant arrangements are in place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The presentation of the evidence of child witnesses will not be easy. Language and cultural difficulties will make the process traumatic, although the video link provisions presently in the bill are welcome to expedite these activities. It will not be possible to compel witnesses to attend to give evidence. The likelihood that the parents of the child will not be available, or will not make themselves available, to give evidence and the absence of birth registration procedures in many south-east Asian countries will require prosecuting authorities in Australia to be more energetic in gathering the medical and other evidence necessary to prove a child victim's age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prosecutions that are more likely to succeed are those involving allegations against those in Australia of being knowingly concerned in or assisting others in the sexual abuse of children overseas. Travel agencies, tour operators, paedophile organisations disseminating information about child sex tours, Australians who provide facilities overseas in which acts of sexual exploitation take place, and importers and distributors of child pornography will all be readily susceptible to prosecution under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the fact that this legislation was referred to the House of Representatives Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. That committee has produced a very worthwhile report. I commend the chairman of that committee, Mr Daryl Melham, on the work that he and his committee put into producing that report within the very narrow time limits that were imposed. I personally certainly appreciated the opportunity to appear before that committee and to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also welcome the constructive attitude that the Attorney-General, Mr Lavarch, has shown to the recommendations of the committee. The end result is a piece of legislation that I believe is workable and which at the same time will ensure that the rights of an accused person are given proper protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this bill was introduced into the House of Representatives I wrote to the Attorney-General indicating the intention of the Australian Democrats to move a number of amendments to the bill. The main thrust of those amendments was to ease the burden on child witnesses who may be brought to Australia by allowing them to give evidence by closed circuit television. Those amendments were accepted by the government, but in the meantime they seem to have disappeared from the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the committee hearings those provisions were discussed. Of our amendments, those dealing with the separate representation of children in the context of making application for giving evidence by video link or closed circuit television attracted some criticism, which was withdrawn once the amendments were properly understood. Those amendments which applied state laws allowing the giving of evidence by closed circuit television attracted no adverse comment. Indeed, they were supported. Hence, I find their omission from the bill somewhat disappointing. I would like the minister to confirm that this oversight will be addressed in subsequent legislation if it becomes apparent that the Judiciary Act will not operate to pick up the relevant state law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also had expressed concerns about the form of the proof of age provisions. The committee paid considerable attention to this question and the Australian Democrats are satisfied that the formulation that has been adopted strikes an appropriate balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In several significant respects the government has chosen not to act on the recommendations of the committee. The Australian Democrats support the approach taken by the government where it has chosen not to follow the committee's recommendations. Only in one area of difference of opinion do I want to say anything as it concerns a topic that attracted some attention during the hearings of the committee, and it relates to the defence of belief as to age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its report the committee recommended that the onus of proof in relation to the defence based on belief about age should not be on the accused person. As the bill stands, if the defendant wants to rely on the defence that he or she thought the child concerned was over the age of 16, then the onus was on the defendant to satisfy the jury of this fact on the balance of probabilities. The committee's recommendation would have the effect of requiring the prosecution to disprove such a belief beyond reasonable doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all respect to the committee, this recommendation ignores the policy behind not just this particular piece of legislation but also those penal statutes that have as their object the proscription of sexual activity with children. As a society, we are opposed to the sexual exploitation of the young and expect adults to regulate their sexual behaviour by ensuring that they avoid such activity. In the context of the exploitation of child prostitutes, this social policy must be even more important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Its purpose is surely to say that if people travel abroad and pay for sexual services in a context notorious for the fact that many young people are involved, it is incumbent upon them to establish that their sexual partners are above the age of 16. Given that they have this responsibility it is surely reasonable to require the accused to bear the onus of proving such an issue. I should add that this approach is adopted in equivalent provisions in most Australian jurisdictions, and I support the approach taken by the government on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I acknowledge that the minister has acted appropriately in not raising expectations too high about the number of prosecutions that are likely to be brought under this legislation, the Australian Democrats do not accept that this legislation should become a paper tiger. In correspondence with the minister I have repeated the demand made by organisations such as ECPAT that this legislation be backed by resources sufficient to ensure its effective enforcement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those resources include: increasing the number of AFP officers in foreign countries to undertake the liaison work with the local police forces that will be entailed by this legislation; establishing a specialist unit within the AFP to  investigate these offences with sufficient staffing and financial resources to be effective in its role&mdash;which means increasing the budgetary allocation to the AFP and not just rearranging the deck chairs after the law enforcement review; and increasing the funding to the DPP to allow it to effectively pursue the inevitably expensive prosecutions that will arise under this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also means: ensuring that staffing at points of entry into the country is sufficient to uncover evidence of paedophilia activity that may be carried into the country; and ensuring that video link technology is in place here and overseas for use in prosecutions brought under the legislation; increasing the level of Australia's assistance to foreign countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Sri Lanka so that the circle of poverty that forces so many children into prostitution can be broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also include: funding of an education program aimed at ensuring on a long-term basis that those who leave Australia are fully aware of the extraterritorial effect of this bill and the high penalties attaching to offences committed under it; and ensuring that those who travel overseas are made aware of the fact that involvement in the production of child pornography and its possession are criminal offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his second reading speech the minister suggested that the effect of this bill will be cost neutral. I do not accept that and many of the witnesses who gave evidence at the hearings, including representatives from the Australian Federal Police Association, did not accept that either. The AFPA gave an estimate of $70,000 to $90,000 just to bring a case to a committal hearing. So I again call on the minister to give a commitment on behalf of the government to properly funding the implementation of this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, l want to pay a tribute to the ECPAT organisation for the tireless work it has done and is doing to bring world attention to the appalling problem of child prostitution and other forms of sexual abuse. As all honourable senators would be aware, ECPAT has been very active in lobbying the government to introduce this type of legislation and in lobbying all parliamentarians to ensure that the bill is passed. Its contribution to the committee hearings was also very valuable. The passion of its members for their cause is an inspiration. The exploited children of Asia have a resolute ally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be remiss of me not to mention that I have appreciated and have been the beneficiary of the assistance of Mr Ken Archer, who spent some months in my office on an executive development scheme seconded from the ACT DPP. His contribution to the work on this bill was of immense assistance to me and I have appreciated it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I endorse the remarks made by Senator Spindler expressing horror at the abuse of young children overseas by Australian tourists. Everyone in the Senate and, indeed, across the community would join in any expression of horror at such behaviour. Secondly, I agree wholeheartedly with him that any tour operator or, indeed, any person in Australia who encourages such activity should face the full sanction of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as outlined by Senator Vanstone, the problem is the efficacy of this bill. Our criminal justice system follows the golden thread of justice&mdash;that a person is innocent until proven guilty, and proven guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. No amount of horror, no amount of murders, no amount of assaults, no amount of degradation of the individual can justify any derogation from that golden thread of justice&mdash;and I believe that this bill is doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the bill has some very good components, it falls down in parts. As Senator Vanstone said, the government is rushing headlong into legislation without thinking about the ramifications of what it is constructing in this bill. I would like to refer to some comments made by witnesses who appeared before the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitution Affairs. Mr Sides QC stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Child sex tourism exploits children and it exploits poverty, and it is desirable that this country should play a part in bringing it to an end.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt about that; no-one takes issue with that. However, Mr Sides went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any legislation should be workable and it should be practical. It is no use passing legislation that is unworkable. In the rush to end this most hideous trade we must not lose sight of the fundamental principles that underpin our democratic institutions; one of those is the right of the accused to a fair trial . . . The right of the accused to receive a fair trial is paramount. If that right is undermined we compromise our democratic institutions . . . It is my view that there are significant and powerful procedures that are not available to accused persons or, for that matter, the prosecution, in this legislative scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>That strikes at the very heart of this bill. This bill has a provision for video evidence. In most states there is now provision for victims of sexual assault and for children to give evidence by video. But the provision of that evidence is under Australian law and under supervised conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not normal for other witnesses to give evidence by video. With this bill clause 50EA and clause 50EC provide for evidence to be given by video. I ask honourable senators to consider this situation: a person goes to Thailand, goes to a bar, engages in sexual relations with someone who is under-age, charges are laid, and the person charged in Australia wants someone who was in the bar at the time of the alleged offence to give evidence. The problem is that the witness is in a bar in Bangkok. That witness either comes to Australia willingly&mdash;no doubt at the expense of the person charged&mdash;or gives evidence by video. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the person giving evidence by video is not in the same place as any other witness giving evidence in the courtroom. If evidence is given by video for the prosecution, the defence counsel or the accused person cannot test that evidence in the flesh&mdash;they have to rely on video evidence. Video evidence should only be used in the most extreme cases. Video evidence has all the hallmarks of a perversion of justice because the witness cannot be tested face to face. It is by looking at the demeanour of witnesses, the way witnesses answer a question, that juries ascertain the facts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a time-honoured way that this country and other countries have run in the administration of criminal justice, so that the person who gives evidence can be seen face-to-face by the jury and, if there is any determination by a magistrate&mdash;which is not covered in this bill&mdash;then the magistrate draws that conclusion. One will hear many times a judge saying to a jury, `You are men and women of the world. In arriving at the conclusion of facts you can assess the witnesses as you have assessed people in your daily transactions. You can size them up as to whether they were telling the truth.' Any video involvement detracts from that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is the question of mistaken belief as to age. Those states that have the criminal code known as the Griffiths code have what is known as an honest and reasonable but mistaken belief as a defence. That is, if one believes honestly and reasonably in a state of things but one is nonetheless mistaken, then in those situations the law says that one can raise that as a defence, that is, that one's mistaken belief as to things is accepted. So the person concerned has no onus of proof. What happens is that that defence is raised during the course of the trial and then it is up to the judge to charge the jury as to that defence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Never ever must the onus of proof shift to an accused person. It does not matter how horrendous the crime is; it does not matter how prevalent a crime is, we must never ever bow to that transgression of justice that the accused has to prove anything. Time and time again we tell a jury, `Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, the accused does not have to prove anything. The accused person does not even have to go into the dock.' Those are time-honoured traditions of justice and they must never be transgressed or else, if they are, this country can count itself for naught. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Senate that the abuse of children overseas is a most horrendous practice; but we have real practical difficulties which must be addressed and which the government, in its undue haste, has failed to address. I tell the Senate solemnly that we will be back here in a year's time after the High Court has dealt with its first appeal throwing this out because this has not been crafted, it has not been drafted and put together as well as it might have been. There has not been the aforethought that such a serious piece of legislation requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are, after all, trying to govern the actions of people in a sovereign state, in a state where our law has no application. I believe that, as much as a deterrent factor is needed, we must ensure that we do not abrogate our principles of justice in doing so. Remember the instance I mentioned of the person who is charged and who comes back to Australia. What of the cost to that person?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal aid funds are well burdened with other matters. It is known that throughout the country legal aid is stretched very thinly. I say to the Senate that, in such a case, one cannot have the average individual who might be charged wrongly, remembering that he or she is innocent until proven guilty, although the government might change that pretty soon, facing the cost of bringing a witness from a foreign country in order to bolster the defence&mdash;in other words, the accused person has to prove himself or herself innocent. That, I think, is a disgraceful state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a disgrace that any mention of a video should be used, other than for evidence given by a child or the victim of a sexual offence. That provision was grudgingly brought in throughout this country to save trauma, to save the overpowering of some victims of sexual offences by the accused in a courtroom situation. But it was only for those reasons; it is not there just to make things easier for the prosecution. It is not there just to make bureaucracy tick a little easier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By bringing in that video link, I tell the government that it is attacking the integrity of the trial. It is attacking the fundamental ability of a properly directed jury to assess the veracity of evidence given by a witness. I believe the evil that we create by cutting across the principles of justice will be greater than the evil that we are trying to cut out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can only effectively deal with this horrendous problem by placing in our statutes proper legislation, legislation which will work. We must remember Mr Sides QC who said, `It's no use bringing in legislation which won't work.'

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue that underlies the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill is extremely significant and complex. It is always difficult to regulate human beings' behaviour, especially when it veers into the area of moral and social attitudes and values. I acknowledge that the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in its report and the rewriting of certain sections has improved the bill considerably since it was first introduced into the other place. This is another illustration of the usefulness of the Senate and the possibility of giving scrutiny to legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech I would like to address two main aspects: some specific concerns regarding the cross-examination of child witnesses and the use of video link procedures; and child prostitution. I acknowledge my thanks to Marion Dixon and Doug Hodgson from the University of Western Australia Law School who my staff contacted and who gave us some very helpful comments on the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Referring to the cross-examination of the witness by the accused, a comment that I believe should be on the public record is that there should be a provision that the child ought not to have to be subjected to personal cross-examination by the accused if he or she is not represented. The child should not have to be confronted by the accused and his or her questions. This could be intimidating and quite terrifying. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia has guidelines that might be helpful here&mdash;and Western Australia's laws on child witnesses are arguably among the most progressive worldwide. There, the accused is notified of this fact before the trial, and is required to write down the questions. These questions are read out by the judge's associate to the child. The court is later adjourned for the accused to write more questions if necessary, and this would presumably comply with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, article 14(3), which allows the right for the accused to cross-examine the witness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the evidence by video link, the term is wrong and misleading. It is generally misinterpreted by the public to be a pre-recorded video&mdash;but it is actually closed circuit television, and should be called that; that is, a live giving of evidence being televised, similar to someone watching this debate in his or her own room through the video monitor, except it is even better because there is an interactive capacity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer now to the allowance for evidence by video tape as well. Notwithstanding closed circuit television, there should also be provision for the use of normal video tapes for the giving of evidence by a child witness, as there is in Western Australia. According to law, the child cannot undergo therapy until after the trial, because it could be seen as a contamination of that evidence. So a six-month delay in the trial means no therapy until then. In my view, it is utterly unacceptable that the aims of the court are actually given precedence over the desire to protect and look after the interests of the child. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A videotape means that evidence has been given once and for all and the child can begin to heal and recover. In Western Australia, an application is lodged that evidence be given on videotape. The child and counsel record their evidence in the presence of a presiding officer. That tape is then shown to the trial and the child is spared the additional trauma of a court appearance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ellison spoke about the presumptions of innocence and guilt; he also talked about the importance of a physical appearance in court. However, in this case I believe that can be damaging because of the vulnerability of child witnesses. This legislation presumes that a court appearance by the witness will occur unless other provisions are met. To prevent more harm or distress to the child, however, it should be presumed that video or closed circuit television will be used. So I disagree with Senator Ellison on that point, but only because of the age of the witness and the trauma to which that witness will be subjected. To subject the child to an investigation to see whether a court appearance is appropriate could be as distressing as the court appearance itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally on this section, this legislation says that even if we have the facilities and the situation for the witness to give evidence on closed circuit television, we must still ask whether it is in the interests of justice to do so, remembering at the same time that we must not treat the interests of justice as an additional requirement. This confusion could surely only lead to protracted legal wrangles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the more general area of child sex tourism&mdash;we must maintain uppermost in our minds that the purpose of this legislation is for the benefit of children; those who are vulnerable to the child sex tourism trade&mdash;we need to look more deeply than simply legislative responses. We need to look at all the different efforts that have been made over time to combat this serious problem and devise ways of looking even further than solutions. We have to look towards causes and prevention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anti-trafficking and anti-slavery conventions, and the ILO, have tried to confront these issues. The ILO has adopted a minimum age for admission to employment and the UN has banned forced labour and slavery. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child 1989 contains two provisions on child prostitution and it has had near universal acceptance. Most sending and receiving countries of child sex tourism have become parties to it and will thus become subject to the scrutiny of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. Exceptions to this are Japan and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the draft optional protocol obligates parties' national and international measures to protect children from sexual exploitation, extraterritorial legislation remains an option, although there is an obligation to cooperate with other signatories. Article 1 at last recognises sexual exploitation of or trafficking in children as crimes against humanity. They are now considered in the same category as war crimes, such as wilful killing, torture, genocide, enslavement, unlawful mass deportations and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Article 2 gives the parties power to effect national legislation to support universal criminal jurisdiction, regardless of where the offence was committed and the nationality of the alleged offender. The offence is now considered contrary to the interests of the international community and all parties are entitled to apprehend and punish the offenders in their own courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The draft optional protocol is an important symbolic step forward and so is this present legislation. However, there are some notable omissions and these are: the lack of provision for financing of rehabilitation schemes; extra costs which will have to be incurred by the law enforcement agencies of the developing receiving states; and no uniform definition of child or age of consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our legislation has gone partially towards some of this, it certainly has not looked at the treatment or rehabilitation side. If we are really serious about dealing with this problem, we must recognise that criminal penalties and what is hoped to be a deterrent effect will do nothing to stop the behaviour and the problems that have caused this kind of trade to be possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is legislation in other countries. I think the countries that are involved in receiving some of these unwanted tourist exports are signifying their recognition of how serious a problem it is. In Thailand legislation was recently proposed to target the customers of child prostitutes. Before 1987 the female age of consent was 13; now it is 16. In Sri Lanka a police and ministers' task force has been set up to investigate the issue and there is consideration of laws to make sexual abuse of children subject to 10 years prison. I believe that in Thailand the penalty is a fine and 12 years prison. In Taiwan the Child Prostitution Prevention Bill provides for perpetrators and for education and counselling for child victims. I believe that is a very enlightened example. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Philippines the age of consent was 12 and all prostitution was criminal, but now children under 18 engaged in prostitution are exempt from criminal liability. Rather, they are the exploited party. An adult found in a hotel room with an unrelated child is deemed to be engaged in sexual exploitation. Convicted foreigners are to be deported after serving a sentence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But no systematic attempt has been made to address the causes. Law alone will not suffice. The legislation must be enforced to be effective and the problems in enforcing it, and enforcing it consistently, are obvious. The receiving countries could be, on the one hand, less ambivalent towards the rights of sex tourists, being glad of the money from tourism, but, on the other hand, not pleased with the aspect of sexual exploitation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Protective measures&mdash;for example, prostituted children's refuges or safe houses to which the police could make appropriate referrals&mdash;need to be given far more support and investigation than has been the case so far. Reform of the police&mdash;ensuring that they are paid adequately, trained and educated and enjoy reasonable working conditions&mdash;would reduce the corruption that can inevitably result when they are not reasonably paid. We could follow the Sri Lankan initiative of creating a specialist child protection police unit with a special mandate to investigate child prostitution, pornography and paedophile rings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the sending countries&mdash;and by passing this legislation we will join this group&mdash;in 1993 Germany extended its penal code to include criminal acts by German nationals, including sex with a child under 14 years. In Sweden nationals who sexually exploit children in other countries can be prosecuted within their own country and France and New Zealand are considering similar legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are problems for child witnesses. The cooperation of child witnesses could well be hindered because of the possibility of prosecution in their own country, or persecution by criminal elements or unwillingness to miss the financial benefits that may well be enabling them to survive. Travel to Australia means a foreign culture, language and judicial process, so I believe that the video link aspect is fairly crucial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of protection of the victims, there are some very important suggestions that have been made from various agencies and I think we ought to be looking at some of the examples in other areas. Because of the shortness of time, I will not go into them now, but I have already mentioned the importance of rehabilitation and funds being made available in that area. If we are serious enough to present legislation, we really need to be looking at other resources that deal with the causes of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to realise that poverty is the cause. In countries most affected by child prostitution there are still a lack of social subsidy support for families. I believe that if we are serious we ought to be also looking at our foreign aid programs and seeing whether we are addressing that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Education campaigns need to be conducted. Responsible tourism requires public education to dispel myths that child prostitution in South-East Asia is legal and culturally relevant; to increase awareness of the social unacceptability of child sex tourism; and to let the tourist know what is acceptable and illegal behaviour in a country and the penalties at home if apprehended. Tourism and airline industries should restrain their members from organising or promoting sex tours and monitor ads which subtly promote sex tourism. Maybe we need a responsible tourist code of ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to acknowledge the important role that non-government organisations have played. They have played a huge role in increasing public awareness of the rights of the child. It is often through their expertise, recommendations and lobbying that the United Nations and governments have become motivated to correct injustices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A multitude of NGOs today work against sexual exploitation of, and trafficking in, children. ECPAT, the international campaign to end child prostitution in Asian tourism, was formed after the Ecumenical Coalition on Third World Tourism in Thailand, which was held in 1990. We should acknowledge its efforts, and that this legislation is partially a response to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent upon the United States, Japan, Germany the United Kingdom and Australia, as influential actors on the world stage and as the more notorious of the sending countries, to exert pressure on governments of receiving countries to firm the political will to overcome official corruption and other entrenched causes of child prostitution. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say at the outset in relation to this legislation that I support any initiatives which will ensure that paedophiles from Australia who engage in crimes against children in other countries, let alone in our own country, should be rigorously pursued by law enforcement agencies. However, I have very real concerns, despite all the best intentions of this government and of this particular piece of legislation to pursue this abhorrent activity and put these insidious criminals behind bars, that the sad reality is that any real progress is hampered by a lack of resources within the Australian law enforcement agencies. This is clearly explained in the report of the Review of Commonwealth Law Enforcement Arrangements, dated February 1994. Under the section headed `Organised Paedophile Networks', at paragraph 4.73 on page 36, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paedophile networks have not been the subject of proactive law enforcement, primarily because of a lack of resources. As a consequence, the extent of the networks and their activities remain unknown. Nevertheless, the illegal activities of groups such as these have the capacity to generate profits and there is evidence that they are organised.</PARA>
<PARA>As I say, that raises very genuine and real concerns about the bona fides of this government as far as dealing with this particular problem is concerned. It is all right to come into this parliament and pass laws which it claims will alleviate this situation; but if the resources are not going to be provided to enforce those laws, it is raising false hope in the community. It is simply not good enough, and of little value, to produce legislation like this and increase the penalties for this type of activity, when our law enforcement agencies, which have the responsibility of enforcing the state and federal legislation, are restricted by the lack of resources identified in this review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a real need to adopt a more uniform, national approach with a commitment by this government to provide more resources for stopping paedophiles who prey upon children, not only in other countries, but also within our own.

I might add that it seems to also be published under the auspices of the Gay/Lesbian Press Association and the International Lesbian Gay Association, because it includes their logos on its title sheet here.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN POSTAL CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides the basis for a more competitive mail system in Australia. It also sets the ground for continued improvements in Australia Post's services to customers,&mdash;for greater flexibility to offer customers choice of price and service quality options.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key objective of the Government's micro-economic reform strategy is the efficient and cost-effective delivery of services by its business enterprises. The Bill takes these objectives forward by: </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reaffirming the Government's social objectives to make a letter service available to all Australians at a uniform postage rate. This service is to continue to be provided by Australia Post;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">providing greater opportunities for private mail operators to develop value-added services and niche markets in express mail, time-sensitive and higher value bulk business markets;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">furthering the commercialisation and corporatisation of Australia Post; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reaffirming that Australia Post will remain in public ownership to operate a national postal network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before outlining the detail of the legislation, it is useful to look at the reforms in perspective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's reforms recognise the importance of the uniform postage rate as the principle that allows for universal access to a postal service. This objective is shared by all countries, regardless of their different regulatory arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years, Australia Post has successfully changed from a public service entity with a poor industrial record, to an efficient, profitable enterprise that operates at the forefront of world's best practice and delivery service. As a result, Australia Post enjoys strong community support, particularly in rural areas, which rely heavily on the post as a community service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits achieved so far are evident not only to the Government, but also to Australia Post workers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time to build on this solid base, while setting in place some changes to the regulatory framework to provide a competitive discipline to ensure that services are provided efficiently and economically to Australian businesses and households.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Industry Commission's 1992 review of the Mail, Courier and Parcel industries found that entry barriers to the market were low and that vigorous competition already existed in the courier and parcels markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to this direct competition, new technology options for telecommunications and electronic data interchange provide significant indirect competition to the written message market. With these substitute services developing, the current restrictions on competition based on the physical size, weight and the means of carrying a mail message are unduly limiting businesses that wish to access a range of communications networks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further reform is now needed to recognise these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill amends the Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 which provides the base for Australia Post's operations. Australia Post will remain in full public ownership, but will face competition in some new areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the domestic market, some greater competition will be permitted in the letter market.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitors will be able to carry letters that are charged at four times the standard letter rate. This is a reduction from ten times.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Competitors will also be able to carry letters weighing more than 250 grams. This is a reduction from a 500 gram weight limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes are expected to open up greater opportunities for consumers and service providers in the large letter and express mail markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of document exchange networks will be recognised in the legislation, by allowing the movement of documents within an exchange service. The collection and delivery of letters from a member's address to the document exchange service centre, will continue to be subject to the exceptions to the reserved service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The carriage of letters by a third party from one location to another location of the same organisation will also be permitted. This will give businesses greater flexibility to determine the best and cheapest arrangements for their organisation's mail deliveries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments will clarify the position on directed advertising material, such as catalogues and leaflets. Advertisers will be able to direct identical material to individual addresses by enclosing the material in transparent wrappers, which allows the contents to be easily visible and to distinguish them from letters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes to Australia Post's reserved services will be achieved by amending section 30 of the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also establishes new arrangements for bulk mail interconnection. Letters that are lodged in bulk at specified mail centres that are equipped to accept bulk mail, will receive discounts based on the transport costs avoided by Australia Post where an operator has undertaken part of the carriage. Discounts for interconnection will be subject to independent scrutiny by the Prices Surveillance Authority as part of the Authority's review of standard letter prices.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the case of a dispute between Australia Post and a bulk mailer on the interconnection discount, the Trade Practices Commission will have a role in investigating the dispute and providing advice to the Minister on the rate reduction. Regulations will provide a power for the Minister to direct Australia Post, if he or she thinks fit, to act in accordance with the Trade Practices Commission recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Turning to international mail, the Government's intention is that charges are set commercially to reflect the costs of delivery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently, charges for mail exchanged between countries are set under treaty arrangements by the Universal Postal Union&mdash;a United Nations agency of which Australia is a member country.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rates are based on world average costs and bear little relation to the actual costs of delivery in Australia. The arrangements have meant that Australian postal users have been subsidising the users of higher cost countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will allow Australian companies to capitalise on growing international mail competition. The new arrangements are structured in such a way to ensure that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government continues to meet its treaty obligations to provide universal access for letters; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that private international mail operators are treated on the same basis as domestic customers, once mail enters Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the following changes:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Outgoing international letters will be deregulated. This means that consumers will be able to use any service provider to transport mail for delivery outside Australia.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Incoming international letters will be deregulated subject to a requirement that only Universal Postal Union member countries are able to lodge with Australia Post's network at treaty rates and other international operators interconnect on the same basis as domestic operators.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that Australia Post is not unfairly disadvantaged by the requirement to meet the Government's treaty obligations, the Bill provides that Australia Post may return incoming international mail that tries to by-pass the domestic delivery network or take advantage of low-cost treaty rates. I will be asking Australia Post to establish internal policy guidelines governing the exercise of these treaty provisions and to report to Government on its compliance with these policies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefits of competition are balanced by the Government's ongoing commitment to provide for its community service obligations to make a standard letter service reasonably available to all Australians at a uniform charge, wherever they reside.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community service obligations will continue to be funded by a cross-subsidy on the letter service. This is an efficient and equitable approach that shares the cost of providing the service among all postal users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is important that all Australians have a say in what they want from a postal service. Australia Post's services to rural and remote communities will be subject to a Parliamentary review, conducted once during the life of each Parliament. I will be asking the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport Communications and Infrastructure to complete the review by 1996-97. Representatives of rural and remote communities will be invited to work with the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post is also to be made more accountable for its discharge of these obligations through an amendment that will require Australia Post to report at least annually on how it complies with its community service obligation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that the reforms deliver benefits to consumers in choice of price, services and quality, the Government has established a number of competitive safeguards that include the following:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">remedies against any infringement of Australia Post's remaining reserved services will continue to be provided through the Federal Court;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">other operators will be able to take remedial action under the Trade Practices Act 1974 against any misuse of market power by Australia Post or other operators;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post will be required to publish annually aggregated financial data on reserved and non-reserved services, to demonstrate that there is no unfair cross-subsidisation of services;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Price restraint for the standard letter will be formalised by amendments allowing the Minister to consider movements in the consumer price index as one of the relevant matters, when considering whether to disallow price increases for standard letters;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Prices Surveillance Authority will continue to monitor Australia Post's service prices on those areas of the letter market that are opened to competition, until price competition is achieved in any particular segment. Australia Post will need to establish a case that it is no longer dominant in a particular market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of these changes will be monitored closely and a further review of the remaining restrictions on competition will be undertaken in 1996-97. The Terms of Reference for the 1996-97 review will be consistent with the Government's determinations on the findings of the National Competition Policy Review (the Hilmer Report). This approach reflects the Government's view that a public monopoly must justify the continuation of its monopoly position.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition to these competitive reforms, the Government is also introducing changes to further refine accountability and reporting provisions already in the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These changes were announced by the Minister for Finance last year. These amendments are best seen as running adjustments to the accountability relationship between the Government as the "shareholder" and owner, and Australia Post.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ministerial powers of direction that are exercised in relation to Community Service Obligations, financial targets and dividends will be amended to require the direction to be laid before both Houses of Parliament within 15 sitting days. This amendment provides greater transparency for ministerial powers of direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As reflects the commercial relationship between a shareholder and board, an amendment will require the Minister to consult with the Chairman on the appointment of Directors to the Board. An amendment will also clarify the Board's power to recommend an interim dividend, which reflects general commercial practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secrecy of mail provisions have been revised substantially. Regulations dealing with the opening and examination of mail by authorised Australia Post employees have been brought into the Act. This honours a commitment by the former Minister for Land Transport to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prohibitions on disclosure have been expanded to cover a broad range of postal information. A new provision will make it an offence for unauthorised disclosure of postal information. It will also be an offence to use or further disclose information, if the purpose of the disclosure is different to the original purpose for which it was disclosed. A penalty of two years imprisonment will apply for a breach of these provisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also sets out the limited range of circumstances where access to postal information may be disclosed for law enforcement and national security purposes by Australia Post employees and former employees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Access to the actual contents of mail is not permitted under this Act, except to enable Australia Post to fulfil its obligations to deliver mail and comply with Commonwealth, State or Territory warrants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the circumstances where an Australia Post employee may open or examine mail. For example, these purposes include repairing mail, to obtain sufficient information to deliver the mail or to destroy dangerous articles to protect public safety.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia Post will also be required to report annually on the number of enquiries it receives from agencies seeking access to postal information.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of other amendments reflect changes to Australia Post's operations, recognising that Australia Post has been made subject to state and territory laws. Other changes update references to the Companies Act 1989 to refer to Corporations law, and clarify the Board's power to set terms and conditions covering the retail sale of postage stamps by post office agents and licensees. The latter amendment is needed to support the uniform pricing policy for standard letters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequential amendments are proposed to Part VIIA of the Crimes Act 1914&mdash;Postal Offences provisions to proscribe the carriage of certain dangerous goods. These changes are needed for public safety requirements to bring Australia Post into line with international aviation security standards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consumers and businesses have received substantial benefits from Government reforms in telecommunications, aviation and the waterfront. This Bill extends the industry reform process in the postal sector and sets the framework for further improvements to customer service, choice and service quality, while safeguarding the basic letter service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">COMPLAINTS (AUSTRALIAN FEDERAL POLICE) AMENDMENT BILL</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1989 the then Minister for Justice, Senator Tate, was approached by the Australian Federal Police Association with their suggestions for some changes to be made to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act 1981. In response, he undertook to have a review of the Act conducted by a Working Group composed of representatives of the Attorney-General's Department, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, the Office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police Association was also closely involved in the development of the proposal, although it was not a formal member of the Working Group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Working Group was established in mid-1991. In consultation with the AFPA, it considered proposals from all interested parties, as well as the reports of both the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration's Review of the Ombudsman's Office. Agreement was reached on a number of proposals and the resulting amendments are presented in this Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This has been the first review of the Complaints Act since its commencement over a decade ago, and many of the amendments before you are intended only to make minor adjustments to its operation which will smooth out some of the practical difficulties which have emerged over that time. However, there are some more substantial changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first major amendment concerns the coverage of AFP staff members by the Complaints Act. The Australian Federal Police Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989 established a unified AFP workforce in which all AFP employees are able to undertake duties which would previously have been allocated according to whether the employee was a member of the AFP (that is, a sworn police officer) or a member of the Australian Public Service. The resulting trend towards use of staff members rather than members in situations where police powers are not required increases the likelihood of staff members being the subject of complaints (which would be dealt with in accordance with Public Service procedures). This Bill will provide for all employees to be covered by the same complaints regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second major amendment involves the creation of two new offences. The first of these consists of making false statements or giving false information about action taken by an AFP appointee. The corresponding penalty is equivalent to the penalty for misleading the Ombudsman under section 44 of the Complaints Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for the creation of this offence is that there have been situations where persons charged with an offence have made extremely serious allegations against innocent appointees in an attempt to draw attention away from themselves or to hinder an investigation. In other cases, people might make false complaints for vindictive or vexatious reasons. This needs to be discouraged, as such complaints have a real impact on the officers concerned, as well as wasting the AFP's limited financial and other resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is aware that there is some risk inherent in the creation of this offence. Genuine complainants might be deterred through fear of prosecution, or worse, an officer about whom a legitimate complaint has been made might be tempted to retaliate by bringing a charge against the complainant. To prevent this, a second offence is created whereby anyone who threatens or harms another person because of that person's involvement&mdash;or someone else's involvement&mdash;in an investigation under the Act can be prosecuted for victimisation. It is expected that the simultaneous introduction of these two offences will provide adequate protection for innocent persons while minimising the risk of abuse. Consultation with the Ombudsman is required before proceeding, to ensure that the complainant is given a fair hearing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The third major amendment proposed by this Bill concerns investigations initiated by the Ombudsman of his or her own motion. From time to time the Ombudsman will become aware of a matter which could justify a complaint but which has not been the subject of one. Under the Act as it stands, the Ombudsman has no power to initiate an investigation unless a complaint has been made. This amendment is designed to allow own-motion investigations under the Complaints Act when they are necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A fourth significant change, which entails a number of minor amendments, relates to the admissibility of evidence obtained by the Ombudsman. At present, such evidence is not admissible in disciplinary proceedings. Although this is consistent with the Ombudsman's wider role, it is inconsistent with the role of independent investigator which the Ombudsman fills under the Complaints Act, and will bring the Ombudsman's provisions into line with the admissibility of evidence obtained by the internal Investigation Division of the AFP. Investigation by the Ombudsman under the Act is a last resort and if it is to have real credibility it is necessary that evidence obtained in the course of such investigations be made admissible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The final major amendment focuses on the procedure for the hearing of minor disciplinary charges to which the officer charged pleads guilty. At present, a member who recognises that he or she has made a (relatively minor) mistake may be subjected to the penalty of prolonged uncertainty, because often the Disciplinary Tribunal will not be convened until a more serious case arises. The proposed amendment allows such cases to be dealt with by the Commissioner, where the Ombudsman agrees, instead of the Tribunal. It is designed to eliminate unnecessary delays under the present procedure while providing guarantees that the procedure adopted does not improperly protect the police. The matter can be referred to the Tribunal for penalty by the Commissioner if the Ombudsman agrees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This opportunity has also been taken to make a number of minor amendments, including changes to the conciliation procedure to reflect the consolidation of ranks in the AFP, extension of the Ombudsman's discretion not to investigate trivial complaints to ensure that limited resources are concentrated on more serious matters, and the removal of sexist terminology in those parts of the Act where gender-neutral language has not already been introduced. Other small adjustments are designed simply to replace procedures which have turned out to be practically inconvenient with more efficient methods.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is hoped that the amendments contained in this Bill will bring about a significant improvement in the day-to-day operation of the Complaints Act while removing or replacing those provisions which, because of changes in the structure of the AFP workforce over the past decade, no longer have a policy basis. The Bill demonstrates the government's continuing commitment to the implementation, wherever possible, of recommendations made by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and more generally to ensuring the accountability of public officials, including the police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments have no financial impact.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2)The President shall notify each senator and the relevant minister if the notice of motion is withdrawn pursuant to paragraph (1).</PARA>
<PARA>On Tuesday of this week on behalf of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I gave notice of a motion of disallowance of the Industrial Relations Court rules as contained in statutory rules 1994 No. 110. The committee gave this notice because it was concerned about the validity of the rules which may have breached the procedural safeguards of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. Subsequently, the committee has received undertakings from the Acting Chief Justice of the Industrial Relations Court and has held discussions with officers of the Attorney-General's Department. The substance of the undertakings was that the rules would be remade as soon as possible to place their future validity beyond doubt, while allowing the chief justice and the minister to advise the committee about their present validity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remake rules it will be necessary to remove the existing notice of disallowance because under section 48B of the Acts Interpretation Act instruments such as rules cannot be remade while the subject of such a notice. The committee, however, conscious of its responsibility to the Senate, considers it should not withdraw its motion of disallowance at this stage. Nevertheless, in the interests of the orderly administration of justice, the committee will be prepared to withdraw the motion as long as the chief justice and the relevant minister satisfy its concerns about the present validity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of the present motion is to allow the committee to remove the notice of motion of disallowance before the Senate meets again in seven weeks time, if the committee considers that it is appropriate to do so. If the committee does remove the notice, this will enable the rules to be remade some weeks earlier than would otherwise be possible, thereby allowing the rules to operate with unambiguous validity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If another Senator, at any time after the giving of such notice of intention and before the withdrawal of the notice of motion, indicates to the Senate an objection to the withdrawal of the notice of motion, that Senator's name shall be put on the notice of motion, the name of the Senator who wishes to withdraw the notice of motion shall be removed from it, and it shall not be withdrawn; but if no Senator so objects to the withdrawal of the notice of motion, it may be withdrawn in accordance with such notice of intention.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion appears to me on the face of it to deny any other senator that particular right which is contained in the standing orders. I have only just seen this motion, and it has just occurred to me that that is a problem, to be quite frank. Under normal circumstances, as standing order 78(1) says:</PARA>

<PARA>If under normal circumstances this had been done, Senator Colston would have been required to give notice of intention to withdraw and then, under standing order 78(3), any other senator could object and therefore that would not be withdrawn. Do honourable senators follow?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under this particular procedure that we are following here, the right of such a senator is in fact denied, it appears to me. Unless this is a motion which sort of gives intention to do certain things, I suppose this motion could be regarded as giving intention to withdraw. But it is not giving intention to withdraw; it is giving intention to possibly withdraw. That is not what standing order 78 says.</PARA>

That did not go as far as Senator Harradine would like it to go and I can understand that, but before the Senate rises I shall ensure that a copy of the motion will be sent to every senator so that they are aware of the fact that it may be withdrawn.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we discussed this matter on an earlier occasion there was a strong view in this chamber, supported by the Greens (WA) and by Senator Harradine, that it was important to ensure that such rules should apply. We expressed that strong concern because initially the government wanted to dispose of the rules of procedural fairness in these matters. We wanted to take the government at its word when it said everything would be satisfactory. We felt that that would be made clear when we saw the regulations. However, the government got into a bit of a spin about that because I understand that the regulations could be disallowed for another reason so that schedule 4 would not come into operation. Therefore, understandably that situation was not satisfactory to the government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said earlier, one of the key strategic problems that Australia faces is the vertical fiscal imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states. That imbalance leads to many problems both in terms of state management and indeed in the Commonwealth. In the end we in Australia must face up to that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moves were afoot back in 1991 by Prime Minister Hawke and Premier Greiner and arising out of the Premiers Conference of that year that resulted in an initiative to look at the sharing of the taxes, particularly the income tax base, with the states as a means of redressing this very serious problem. I see no evidence to date of any wish on the part of the government to do anything about the position. Until something is done, we are left with this serious problem and a lot of inefficiency of administration between the Commonwealth and the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also relevant to this legislation and the financial relations between the Commonwealth and states is the operation of the Loan Council. I wish briefly to refer to the work of the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operations of the Australian Loan Council whose report was made available to the chamber in December last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In essence that committee recommended that there should be increased accountability of the loan council to parliaments&mdash;not just to this parliament but to all parliaments in Australia. That included an expanded role for auditors-general. Again that was not only related to the Commonwealth but the states. The committee strongly recommended the adoption of accrual accounting throughout the government. I know that the federal government has given notice that it is still considering the committee's report. Because this bill deals with the Loan Council, I feel that it is worth bringing this matter to the Senate's attention in urging the government to give due consideration to the report and hopefully adopt its major recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental thing behind the recommendations of that select committee is to aim for transparency in reporting of financial agreements. By that I mean we require full disclosure by all entities, by the state and federal governments, of their accounts, not just in simple cash accounting terms, which has been the tradition, but in terms of separating the capital accounts&mdash;what is spent, if you like, by way of investment&mdash;from the operating accounts. Hence this move to adopt full accrual accounting through all governments, including government business enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If that were done, if the same standards were adopted throughout all governments and we had full transparency of reporting of those accounts, we would have a much better administration, I believe, throughout Australia. I urge the government to move hastily and to work cooperatively with the states to adopt full accrual accounting and also to push for full disclosure in the accounts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Gibson has said, the Financial Agreement Bill 1994 has resulted from lengthy negotiations between the Commonwealth and the states and, for the first time, the territories, to redraft the financial agreement of the 1920s. This new financial agreement provides for the continued existence of the Loan Council and the rules, guidelines and arrangements for state borrowing and debt. The bill formalises Loan Council arrangements which have been essentially in operation since 1990. The agreement has the support of all of the parties to it; that is, from the state and territory governments, as well as the federal government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, the agreement will not become effective until such time as complementary legislation has been enacted by all of the other parties. They are well down the track on that, as I understand it. My advice of a few weeks ago is that New South Wales is aiming for the introduction of its legislation in the budget sittings in August. In Victoria, the legislation passed through both houses before the Victorian parliament rose a couple of weeks ago. In Queensland, as of mid-May, the bill had been approved by cabinet, but because the legislative program was congested, introduction is precluded before the August-September sittings. I am advised that Western Australia has approved the drafting of legislation, and it will be introduced into the Western Australian parliament once the federal parliament has passed its federal legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill has been approved by the South Australian cabinet, and I understand it is to be introduced on the first day of the next sittings in July. The Tasmanian Treasurer has approved legislation which will be submitted to the Tasmanian cabinet for approval; that may even have been done by now. Again, the intention is to introduce legislation into the Tasmanian parliament following the passage of the Commonwealth legislation. The ACT has already passed its own bill. I think the Northern Territory has as well, although I am not certain of that. Certainly, it had been introduced into the Legislative Assembly. So the states and territories are well on the way to completing the complementary tasks that are required on their part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concurrent with the Financial Agreement Bill is the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994, to repeal the national debt sinking fund, which has become redundant in the last few years as the states have redeemed all of their debts previously held in the fund. The states now borrow funds in their own right without recourse to the sinking fund, making its continued existence unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These two bills are essentially of a housekeeping nature, to bring them into line with current practice. By using the term `housekeeping', I do not want to in any way detract from their significance, because the rewriting of the financial agreement is a fundamental step forward in the evolution of Commonwealth-state financial relations. Obviously, the previous financial agreement had become, in many respects, arcane and certainly not relevant to today's needs to the extent that it was required to be. So this is a very important step forward. Therefore, the coalition will not be opposing these bills; indeed, we will support them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I notice, however, that the bill does not take any account of the sound recommendations made in the detailed report by the Senate Select Committee on the Functions, Powers and Operation of the Australian Loan Council which was tabled in this place last December. I note that the second reading speech by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) at least acknowledged the report, but did not really seek to address it. I think that is a serious omission, and I am sorry that that is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the fact that the recommendations have not been addressed at this stage does not mean that they will never be addressed. I urge the government to look again at the recommendations of the select committee because I think there is merit in them. I hope that they will not be laid dustily on a shelf forever and a day, because they would improve the present situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the select committee was established after a quite deceitful breach of the prevailing borrowing guidelines had been exposed. That breach, by the former Kirner Labor government in Victoria in May 1992, was for over $1.2 billion worth of borrowings which were not disclosed in accordance with the guidelines before the October 1992 state election in Victoria&mdash;an election that was dominated by financial mismanagement by Labor. Indeed, the Kirner Labor government never disclosed the borrowings to anyone other than the then federal Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, and his officials. It was not until the Kennett Liberal coalition government was sworn in that the then new Treasurer, Mr Stockdale, revealed the massive deception and cover-up. He then began the appropriate action to rectify the breach and legitimise the borrowings within Loan Council guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was this action by the Victorian Labor government in 1992 which was the last straw in the credibility of the then Loan Council arrangements and which forced the revamped borrowing and disclosure arrangements which are encompassed in this bill. Those arrangements were finalised in July last year. Amongst other things, the Senate select committee report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Victoria's breach of its Loan Council limit in mid-1992 represented the most significant and public undermining of the Loan Council's procedures in its history.</PARA>
<PARA>Of equally grave concern was the role of the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, in covering up the Victorian state Labor government's action. In its report, the Senate committee found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that the Treasurer's actions had the effect of concealing from the public a major breach of financial discipline.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Dawkins's lack of attendance at the meetings of the select committee, when it was conducting hearings on this matter, was a major disappointment and meant that the committee was never fully informed as to why he had acted as he apparently had. The contemptuous attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) towards the Senate only further undermined public and market confidence in his commitment to accountability and responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key themes of the select committee's hearings really revolved around accountability, transparency, responsibility, disclosure, reporting and integrity. Those themes were responsibly and exhaustively covered by the committee. The committee arrived at a sensible, practical and effective set of conclusions and recommendations to address those things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, I hope that the government will begin to take financial accountability proposals more seriously than it has taken the Senate committee to date. They are important elements in rebuilding broader community confidence in the parliament, and particularly the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the minister said in his second reading speech, the bill constitutes an important step in the continuing evolution of the Commonwealth financial relationship with the states and territories, and I certainly confirmed my support of that in my earlier remarks. However, the bill does not&mdash;nor is it intended to&mdash;encompass the most important elements of Commonwealth, state and territory financial relationships. Of those, by far and away the most important is the fundamental problem of the imbalance between the Commonwealth and the states in terms of their revenue raising and expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth raises some 80 per cent of total public revenue in Australia and the states raise only about 20 per cent, but they each are responsible for about 50 per cent of total public sector spending. As well, half of all Commonwealth financial grants to the states are tied to specific purposes, and only half can be used for general purposes at the determination by the states of their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That gives a centralist federal government&mdash;as this one quite clearly is&mdash;enormous leverage over state governments. If we want proper accountability and proper resource management in this country that leverage has to be broken; the states have to have more responsibility for raising the revenue that they want to spend, and they have to have more flexibility in terms of the expenditure decisions that they may wish to take. Those are all matters for another day and I will not go into them any further. They bear recording here because I think, arguably, the proper, sensible reform of the Commonwealth-state financial relationships is one of the most important reforms that we could possibly undertake if we are to produce the type of Australia in terms of economic efficiency, competitiveness, growth prospects and dynamism that we all want. As I said, more of that for another time. In the meantime, I close by again confirming the support of the opposition for these bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to begin where Senator Short left off and point out that our principal criticism of the Financial Agreement Bill 1994 and the National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994 relates to the fact that the government has really not followed due process. It has before it a carefully considered report by a Senate select committee which looked at these matters. One would have hoped that, had it proceeded correctly, it would have responded to those recommendations well within the time; and having responded to those recommendations, it would have incorporated those recommendations in this legislation. It is a source of some criticism of the government that that did not happen. I believe it is a failure of the process which the government should have followed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I simply remark that the Financial Agreement Bill 1994 gives effect to the 1994 Commonwealth-state financial agreement, and it codifies the new Loan Council arrangements which have been evolving since 1990. It codifies the present practice under which the responsibility for states' borrowings has been devolved from the Commonwealth to the states. The Loan Council makes resolutions on the level and nature of borrowings, but has no power over them. The ACT and the Northern Territory are Loan Council members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Debt Sinking Fund Repeal Bill 1994&mdash;which has a lovely acronym of NDSFRB&mdash;abolishes the Commonwealth's central borrowing fund through which most public sector borrowings were once centralised. The Financial Agreement Bill establishes a debt retirement reserve trust account for the transitional purchase and repayment by the states of Commonwealth security debt on allocation to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1990 Loan Council arrangements were amended in 1992&mdash;and this point has been made by the two previous speakers&mdash;as a result of the so-called Victorian loans affair in which the Victorian government went way outside its limit. This also led to the establishment of the Senate Loan Council Committee, or the select committee inquiring into the Australian Loan Council. The new arrangements amounted to a deregulation of public sector borrowing, with market discipline taking the place of formal Loan Council controls.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provision of better information to the markets is regarded&mdash;and a great deal of evidence was given to the committee in this respect&mdash;as the cornerstone of that discipline. Loan Council decisions will be reported after each meeting. Public sector financing requirements&mdash;that is the total deficit/surplus for each jurisdiction, and the national figure for all jurisdictions&mdash;will be reported quarterly. One of the quarterly reports will include an annual report giving the year's financing requirement, and a comparison with the Loan Council target for that year. The financing requirements for each jurisdiction will also be reported annually in the respective governments' budget statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is generally agreed that the national deficit/surplus represents the best available measure of the public sector's net call on private sector funds. The committee generally supported the reforms, but it concluded that accountability mechanisms should be improved and incorporated in the proposed new financial agreement which had not been finalised when the committee made its final report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Specifically, the committee recommended that the financial agreement provide for quarterly and annual reports of public sector financing requirements&mdash;this is currently only required by agreement of the Loan Council&mdash;and the adoption of accrual accounting, and I think Senator Gibson has mentioned this. This means reporting revenue/expense when earned/incurred, rather than reporting cash transactions. This would make it difficult for governments to manipulate cash flow to meet annual targets, and is expected to be adopted by governments over the next few years. In that respect, let me point out in passing that the movement to accrual accounting&mdash;that is taking into account contingent liabilities&mdash;would also help to move the states and the Commonwealth towards proper environmental accounting because the contingent liabilities relating to environmental damage would have to be taken into account in a proper system of accrual accounting. That again should have been more strongly emphasised in the move towards this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third recommendation of the committee was for full auditing of relevant Loan Council statements/reports by the state and federal auditors-general. There is a difference of view as to the auditors' capacity to fully audit Loan Council reports incorporated in annual budgets as currently proposed. The auditors believe that they have full powers to do so, but the Loan Council has expressed doubts. This recommendation would presumably put the matter beyond doubt. Again, one would have liked to have seen that question of auditing included in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final recommendation concerned a separate national annual Loan Council report audited by the Commonwealth Auditor-General, to be tabled in all parliaments. This again would have aided in the matter of transparency and accountability to which Senator Short was referring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government has not responded to the committee's report even though the three month time limit has long passed. The financial agreement reflects none of these recommendations although, with the exception of accrual accounting, they are largely in effect as a result of the new Loan Council procedures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by saying that we are not opposing this legislation. We are criticising it on the grounds that it fails to implement all the committee's recommendations. As chairman of the Senate select committee I am critical of the government because it has not responded to the report of the committee before this; had it done so it would have been able to incorporate its response to these recommendations in the legislation. We believe that, at the very least, the inclusion of the auditing and accrual accounting mechanisms would have been an improvement in this new state-Commonwealth financial arrangement, but we are not intending to move any amendments and we are supporting the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Financial Agreement Bill 1994 and the Debt Sinking Repeal Bill belong to that strange category of bills that come through the parliament from time to time&mdash;bills we do not want to support but, given the alternatives, do not want to oppose. The Financial Agreement Bill seeks to legitimise what has already happened in the Loans Council, which is that the Commonwealth is basically demanding tighter control over state finances. It is seeking to extend Commonwealth powers of control over state borrowing, or subsequent control over global borrowing, to include levels of available state funds as a criteria for borrowing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seeks to make the states more accountable by demanding quarterly instead of annual reports and by including a wider range of elements in the assessment for borrowing. It seeks to make this situation hold less by legislation and more by regulation, taking it from having a basis in law to a basis in power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many ways, this bill tightens Commonwealth control over the states, increasing Commonwealth control of taxes and revenue raising and its ability to control state grants. It uses this control over revenue to exercise control over state borrowing and in this way exercises control over the money available to state governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By moving to a position where the power is held in fact rather than in law, the bill appears to be loosening Commonwealth control when actually it is not. For these reasons, we have problems supporting both bills. They give the Commonwealth more power while making that power less formal and less accountable to parliamentary review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are reasons for this occurring, and these reasons affect our ability to accept the existing legislative framework. The Loan Council's shift to control over global borrowing occurred because states were using the ability of state instrumentalities to borrow without scrutiny to avoid any controls on actual state borrowing. They also used the ability to borrow to create large cash funds to use as they wished&mdash;the so-called hollow logs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, during the 1980s and early 1990s states, such as Victoria, got into massive borrowing and got into trouble. This trouble reflected on the economic position of Australia as a whole, and it was the Commonwealth that the states turned to when they needed to get out of trouble. It is clear that allowing the states unrestricted control can harm and has harmed other states and the nation as a whole. Therefore there must be some measure of responsibility by individual states to other states and the Commonwealth. This leads us to support the need for a change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question is whether the changes proposed adequately and appropriately address the issue. We feel that the move to greater control by the Loan Council is designed to entrench and extend Commonwealth economic power over the states, but it also responds to irresponsible borrowing by the states. The old legislation no longer reflects the reality and leaves holes which have allowed the problem borrowing; therefore it should not stand. The proposed legislation simply gives the Commonwealth more power without making its responsibilities clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills will pass but this is mainly because the formal powers of the Commonwealth appear to be diminished. States will be allowed to borrow in their own right. But this is actually a move to reduce Commonwealth debt, since it has been negotiated as part of a deal which will see the states making an accelerated payback of Commonwealth debt taken out on their behalf. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sinking or payback of this debt will go from $900 million in 1993-94 to $1,800 million in 1994-95. The Commonwealth will get nearly $1 billion extra from the states towards its deficit reduction. States are allowed to go out and borrow on the commercial markets in order to sink this debt. While states can now borrow in their own names, they will still be constrained in borrowing through the Loan Council so they do not actually have more power to borrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many honourable senators will be aware that the Greens favour a more decentralised system of decision making. Part of our problem with these bills is that we do not see the states as the natural framework for this power. We feel that decentralisation is about giving the community more control over the issues and actions that affect people's lives, and this means decentralisation of decision making to regions and communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">States have often been worse than the Commonwealth when it comes to ignoring communities and the public. Although we oppose the centralisation of power we are not jumping on the states rights band wagon&mdash;the centralisation of power at state level. We are also not in favour of increasing the debt levels of either the states or the Commonwealth and believe that additional spending should be the result of community collective value decisions and paid for by the additional revenue collected as the community decides is appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the Greens are in favour of increased decentralisation, we also know that there are issues that should be dealt with over larger areas&mdash;multi-regionally, federally, internationally. The issues that need such treatment are those that affect people over those areas. But such agreement should ideally be made by communities of communities&mdash;regions and communities acting together in the collective interest&mdash;not by some autocratic paternalistic organisation that will decide what is best for people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current financial agreement and Loan Council structure has already been abandoned as inadequate. The new Financial Agreement Act seems fundamentally flawed. Neither the ALP nor the coalition seem to be flexible enough to support any approach that would be in line with the position put by the Greens. There does not seem to be any appropriate response for us to make in this case and, since the coalition is voting with the government on this, it hardly matters what we say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The passage of this bill is a foregone conclusion. Obviously, nothing can be done at this time and hopes of real change lie in the future. We would therefore like the Senate to seriously look at the roles of communities, regions, states and Commonwealth in regard to powers and responsibilities, and to consider the entire issue of the various tiers of government, particularly any proposal to fundamentally alter the constitution to move towards a republic. We will therefore abstain from voting on this bill. </PARA>

The first category is best described as housekeeping amendments which have arisen from a further examination of the bill by the government and relate to clauses 34, 50, 73, 76 and 79. The amendment to clause 79 is to extend the power to set fees for essential derivation, which is consistent with policy adopted for similar applications throughout the bill but which was unintentionally omitted from the bill. The revocation provisions apply in the bill to grants of the breeder's right, and amendments are proposed to extend the provisions of revocation of breeders' rights under section 50 to essentially derived varieties. It is proposed to delete the superfluous subclause 73(3) since the infringement related to an essentially derived variety as provided for under section 53.

<PARA>Clauses 3 and 6, one of which we are seeking to amend and the other of which we are seeking to delete, clearly go together. They relate to the widening of the provision for plant breeders' rights to species which are not classified as plants. This is not in accordance with the international agreement, it is not necessary and we feel it draws a much wider compass for this legislation than is necessary or desirable. Clause 3 relates specifically to the fact that the definition of a plant includes all fungi and algae but does not include bacteria, bacteroids, mycoplasmas, viruses, viroids or bacteriophages. Any botanist will tell us that fungi and algae are not plants but are in a separate grouping by themselves. Clause 6, which we are seeking to delete, essentially suggests that one can take genetic material from these other species and put them into plants. Clause 6 reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of this Act, an organism may be treated as constituting a plant grouping within a single botanical taxon despite the fact that the genome of the plants in that plant grouping has been altered by the introduction of genetic material that is not from plants.</PARA>
<PARA>It clearly recognises that that genetic material might come even more widely than from fungi or algae. Indeed, clause 6 suggests that we could take a human gene, for instance, and put it into a plant and that plant would then be covered by this legislation. </PARA>

Clause 6 opens the door for essentially the patenting of the use of genetic material, which is much wider than plant genetic material, including genetic material from humans. It is for that reason that we would seek to amend clause 3 to limit the definition of a plant to only things which are plants and to exclude clause 6 altogether. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Coulter said that it was accepted&mdash;I do not want to misquote him&mdash;that fungi and algae are not plants or animals. It is the intention of this legislation to make it clear that fungi and algae will be treated as plants under this legislation. New Zealand and Japan have fungi included in their PBR schemes. Japan has also included algae. Other countries are likely, we are informed, to protect fungi and algae and include them within the definition of a plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The convention itself is silent on the definition of `plant', and it has been left to national laws to include micro-organisms under `plant'. Are they a plant or are they an animal? Australia has, as a matter of policy, adopted the traditional position that there are two kingdoms: plants and animals.

We want to define as clearly as we can in this legislation what is meant by `plant'. The definition in the bill is taken from and includes all of the elements of article 14 of the UPOV convention. This definition was the subject of three years of debate at the UPOV meetings in consultation with breeders internationally. The definition is comprehensive and seems to meet the needs of the concept of essential derivation in which the genotype plays a determinant role. The definition in the bill has been agreed to in consultation with plant breeders in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government opposes the third amendment. It is procedural and is already more fully and more appropriately catered for in clause 34. With regard to the Democrats' fourth amendment, the aim of the PBR scheme is to encourage investment in new technology and new varieties by protecting new varieties that are the products of plant breeding. Genetic manipulation is now a standard breeding process. If genetic manipulation as a breeding process is to be regulated it should be, and will be in the future, subject to the regulatory GMO law. Should a product of genetic manipulation, including transgenic plants, pass the test of GMO laws and regulation, it should not be denied PBR protection. To do so would deny Australia access to transgenic plants, which would reduce its competitiveness globally. For example, I understand that a cotton plant has been developed. There is transgenic&mdash;I am not sure of the correct name&mdash;implanting within what is accepted as the cotton gene, but it is fundamentally a cotton gene. For that reason, we oppose the Democrats' fourth amendment. Under the UPOV convention, rights cannot be denied to a new plant variety because of the way in which it is bred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Reading this bill carefully, we find there is no protection. I think the parliamentary secretary must answer Senator Harradine on this. There is no protection at all in relation to human genes. It seems to me that this legislation is designed specifically to protect plant species which are grown as plants for plant like purposes&mdash;the production of grains for food; the production of flowers for our entertainment; those sorts of things. It is for the protection of plants commercially, for plant like purposes. That is as clear as I can put it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 6 would allow the inclusion of a human gene into a plant, which could be commercially exploited for reasons quite unrelated to the plant, perhaps for reasons related to human disease&mdash;for example, in the production of enzymes, proteins or something else that might be used for treating humans. I think the answer to Senate Harradine must be that there is no protection in this legislation that would prevent that sort of thing from happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I link that back to the other amendment, the definition of a plant. The parliamentary secretary has been deceptive when he talks about making the legislation clearer by including fungi and algae. It simply begs the question. The UPOV does not require that the definition be broadened. Fungi and algae could be included or excluded; the legislation would be equally clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this legislation, even though we do not agree with it, is to protect plant breeders in a commercial sense, and plant breeding material to be used as plants; not as fungi or algae or as the vehicles for human genomic manipulation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry said that it is possible for human genetic material to be utilised for the purpose of genetic modifications of plants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of points. I come back to the definition of a plant. We should remember that the definition here includes fungi and algae, so the genetic manipulation may not involve the host being a plant. It might be an alga or a fungus. They are more likely to be the organisms used to include human genes. The amendment that I think Senator Harradine is looking for is simply to delete clause 6. That is a perfectly adequate amendment because it would mean that the legislation is kept strictly to plants, the sorts of things everybody in this Senate would regard as a plant&mdash;a thing with green leaves and a stem which grows like a plant, looks like a plant, smells like a plant and has fruit and flowers. The legislation is about plants.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking up the other aspect of what Senator Harradine was saying, the problem with trying to define human genes is that there are large numbers of human genes that are absolutely identical with genes across a wide spectrum of other plants and animals. Genes which have served very basic biological functions over vast aeons of evolutionary time have retained their genetic structure. It would be possible to derive a gene which is absolutely identical with a human gene from, say, a pig or a monkey or even in some cases quite primitive organisms such as bacteria. So the problem is not really whether the thing is a human gene, the problem is this transgenic nature of the plant taking material which is non-plant material and putting it into a plant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I again stress that it seems to me absolutely clear when we read through this legislation from clause 1 to the end that this is about protecting plant breeders, those people who grow those green things with stems and leaves as I described them before, not about protecting those people who might take a fungus and put a human gene or a pig gene into it and use that for commercial purposes, but for quite different purposes from those for which we would grow a plant. It would be produced for the purposes of producing a particular enzyme, hormone or whatever which might be used for the treatment of humans or animals. It would be a totally different purpose. They would not be growing that organism for plant like purposes. I think that is where the objection lies. It is fundamentally broadening this legislation much more than the general run of the intention of the legislation indicates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those points to Senator Harradine. If he wants to try to restrict clause 6 simply to human genes the problem is that we cannot really define a human gene. We can say a gene derived from a human being. The gene might have come from a human cell, but what do we do if that same gene, identical in terms of its DNA sequence, comes from a different source and the purpose is still to deal with a human disease or whatever. Then we do run into the sorts of definitional difficulties that Senator Sherry was talking about. I urge Senator Harradine to support what I am saying and to support both amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that there is a fundamental distinction in plant breeders' rights legislation. The Greens, the Australian Democrats and environmental groups have supported their opposition to PBR by referring to the problem of patenting of life forms. This legislation does not do that. The government is aware, as are other governments of member countries of the convention, UPOV, that there may be problems with patenting life forms. This was the justification for the formation of UPOV in 1961 as a separate body from the World Intellectual Property Organisation, which is the international body overseeing patents. Unlike patenting, PBR law balances the breeder's right with public interest provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither the genes nor the plant itself are locked up by PBR, contrary to what was clearly implied by Senator Margetts and Senator Coulter earlier in their speeches. The Plant Variety Rights Act of 1987 and the PBR bill will protect plants that may be freely used for non-commercial purposes, say, by the home gardener. They are protected plants that can be freely used for bona fide research and development, and its genes used freely for breeding new varieties of plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The protected plant cannot be held from the public. Farmers can freely save seed for their own use. A person cannot protect a naturally occurring variety or ecotype of a native species. There must be an intervention and a genetic change from the natural form into a cultivar. It is therefore misleading to imply that PBR is like patenting. It is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we take Senator Harradine's concern, as I said, it is theoretically possible to put a human gene in a plant. I am advised it has not occurred to date. If that happens, it will be up to the Genetic Manipulation Council, which will be codified&mdash;and I understand that the legislation will be drawn up as a consequence, at least in part, of the report that Senator Harradine was referring to&mdash;will regulate the way in which that is done with human genes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But if someone did put a human gene in a plant it could not be regulated by this legislation, because this legislation regulates only plants, not human genes. It cannot regulate human genes. That will be determined by the legislation. I do not know how this would be weighed up and judged but if the amount of human genetic material was so great in the plant that it was in effect not a plant, it would not be regulated by this legislation. It cannot be, because it is not a plant. This legislation can regulate only plants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, if someone attempted to put a human gene in a plant, there is really no sense in their doing that because they cannot protect the human genetic component under this legislation. The way in which the human gene is dealt with will be dealt with by the genetic manipulation legislation that I have referred to which we will be dealing with next year. This legislation is intended to deal only with what is defined under this bill as a plant. </PARA>

It might be a slightly lesser protection. The fact that people can get access to this genetic material and reproduce it does not in any way deny the fact that the exploitation of this material for commercial purposes is what is protected.

<PARA>This amendment relates to clause 4 on pages 4 and 5 of the bill and relates to the definition of a plant variety. It is a difficult definition. It is attempting to define what a plant variety is. I simply make the point that the definition included in the legislation is extremely unclear where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) it retains the essential characteristics that result from the genotype or combination of genotypes of that variety; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) it does not exhibit any important (as distinct from cosmetic) features that differentiate it from that other variety.</PARA>
<PARA>I imagine that in many plant breeding experiments one might want to, for instance, incorporate very much cosmetic factors because they would be the very factors that make the variety saleable. One could think of, for instance, the attempts to make a blue rose. I could not think of anything more cosmetic than making a rose blue rather than making it red or yellow, yet this definition appears to exclude that characteristic. </PARA>

In fact, in attempting to tighten up the definition those words will in fact open it up. We have taken the definition from the UPOV convention, and it includes the elements of article 14.

<PARA>Amendment No. 5 is to clause 11 on page 6. This is a somewhat difficult clause to fully comprehend, and the amendment also requires some explanation. What we are seeking to do is, under the actions which this legislation allows, add to most of the paragraphs&mdash;paragraphs (a), (b), (e) and (f)&mdash;the words `for sale'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope I can make this clear. In reading the clause as it stands, the clause is very restrictive in the permission which it gives. For instance, it implies that permission would be required to produce or reproduce any material at all, whereas again it seems to me quite clear from the context of the rest of the legislation that what this legislation is seeking to do is restrict the sale or the commercial exploitation of these protected varieties by persons other than the person who actually holds the plant breeder's right. Therefore, we are seeking to add the words `for sale'. To put that in context, the amended clause would read that, subject to the various sections:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . PBR in a plant variety is the exclusive right, subject to this Act, to do, or to licence another person to do, the following acts in relation to propagating material of the variety:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) produce or reproduce the material for sale;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, people would still be free to produce and reproduce. Senator Sherry said a moment ago that that was the case, but the addition of the words `for sale' would mean that that was the action which was specifically excluded. It seems, again in the context of this legislation, that that is the purpose. We believe that the addition of the two words `for sale' to those sections make it far clearer what it is that we are actually restricting. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 17(2) relates to farm saved seed. This is a time-honoured tradition among farmers. The saving of seed from one season to the next and the exchange of seed between farmers is practised perhaps more frequently in Australia than in other countries. We learned from the CSIRO this morning that the incidence of farm saved seed in Great Britain, for instance, is not as common as it is in Australia, and that is possibly because of the greater moisture in the seed and the problems of fungi and mould growing in the seed. Certainly in Australia it is a common practice to save seed from one season to the next. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in front of me a letter from the Queensland Graingrowers branch at Meandarra which expresses a great deal of concern about this provision within the plant breeder's rights legislation. It mentions that oats being sold farmer to farmer can be bought for 35 to 40 cents a kilo, whereas the plant varieties are being sold for up to 70 cents a kilo this year. In time, when all new varieties are produced by seed companies, this will mean that there will be no market pressures for farmers to keep prices down. That is another aspect to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government is not minded to remove this clause, we will certainly divide on it because we believe it is obnoxious. We believe it is moving into an area where it is infringing the fundamental right of the farmer to save seed from one year to the next.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose I could really summarise the situation by saying, `If in doubt, leave it out'. The fact of the matter is that if the subclause to clause 17 was left out and at some future time it was felt necessary to close off the option of farm saved seed&mdash;whether it was a variety, a taxon or just a particular cultivar&mdash;it could be put back and then we would all be aware of exactly what the government was doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that under the present circumstances it seems as though this subclause is surrounded by a certain level of protection. It would take a very brave person to say that the level of that protection is totally adequate for all future years. I think we will see a progression of monopolisation in this area, and with it the sort of power such monopolisation brings about. We have already seen a number of farming organisations sold off as commercial enterprises and bought by totally commercial interests. To rely on the safety which is written into this clause for all future years is a very brave act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would prefer to see this clause deleted and work the other way. That is, if at some future time this sort of provision was felt to be necessary&mdash;if, say, it was felt to be necessary to exclude farmers from saving seed from one year to the next&mdash;that could be looked at again under the circumstances prevailing at the time. To include this provision now is quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest, as Senator Tambling did, that this clause will encourage activity in plant breeding is to suggest that this clause will be used. If this is the clause that will lead to that, this clause will be used to exclude farm saved seed. If it is never going to be used for that particular purpose it will be without effect. It will only have an effect when it is applied. I ask honourable senators to consider that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More generally, to suggest that this legislation will somehow or other lead to that is nonsense. The fact of the matter is that wherever the research is done, wherever the new varieties come from, the money going into that research comes from the community.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, wheat farmers will pay one way or another. They will pay taxes that will go to organisations, such the CSIRO and the Waite Institute, which will develop the varieties. Or that will be done commercially and they will have to pay royalties on the varieties. One way or other they will have to pay; research does not get done for nothing. To suggest that one root will necessarily produce more and better seeds is a no-no. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This clause by itself, if we are assured that it will not be applied, cannot possibly produce any more varieties. It can only produce more varieties if the exclusive commercialisation through the application of this clause, the restriction, leads to greater commercial profits.

Nonetheless, it is not at all clear with that sort of wording that a succession of extensions would not amount to an unspecified period.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course. Thank you. I have been learning very fast on this one. The subclause does not reduce the public interest provisions of public access, which is the purpose of clause 19. Clause 19 relates to new varieties for which there is or could be a consumer demand. Subclause 19(11) relates only to those varieties that are distinct, uniform and stable, which have no consumer or farmer value and thus no consumer demand, but which have high commercial value. Only breeding stock&mdash;that is, inbreds and advanced breeding lines&mdash;fall into this category, or these varieties, since they are breeding stock and not a final product, and they have no value to the farmer or consumer since they are unproductive or of low quality. Inbreds are an intermediate stage in the production of a hybrid, and the breeders will have incurred considerable cost in their development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of clause 19(11) is to encourage the flow of this improved germ plasm into Australia in order to improve our competitiveness. Australian breeders do not have access to these inbreds at present. So the provision does not, in effect, restrict the access of breeders to genetic material. The desirable gene combinations in the inbreds will be available to all breeders as a source of genes from hybrids, which is the final form that is in consumer demand. They will be available from hybrids because hybrids do not qualify under clause 19(11). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I have followed the explanation correctly, clause 19 provides reasonable public access to plant varieties. Throughout the debate in the committee stage of this bill tonight, the government has been at pains to point out that the genetic material will always be publicly available for non-commercial purposes. Yet Senator Sherry is saying that, in the case of those intermediate varieties, which are not of themselves commercially valuable as final consumer products, genetic material will not be available because this section does not apply to a plant variety in respect of which `the secretary certifies that he or she is satisfied that plants of that variety have no direct use as a consumer product'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that there is a loophole in the legislation, as I suspected. Genetic material will be very much exclusively tied up, provided it is intermediate to the preparation of some other variety.

It is of no use to a consumer because it is not fully developed, but it is of use to another developer who could take that material. A lot of money could have been spent on developing that material at this intermediary level. This legislation provides protection where another developer takes that material. If it did not provide protection in those circumstances, that original developer, having spent many thousands or hundreds of thousands of dollars, could have the material taken off him without protection.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion that the Senate deplores the blatant politicisation of the Board of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in flagrant disregard of statutory obligations.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter is particularly urgent because it is almost 10 days since these appointments to the board were foreshadowed and yet it is only as recently as tonight that the government has finally had the courage to confirm what everyone else in the community has known during that time, and that is that Mr John Bannon, failed national ALP President, failed Labor Party Premier of South Australia and the man primarily responsible for probably one of the largest financial fiascos this country has ever seen, together with Ms Wendy Silver, has been appointed to the ABC board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why this matter is of such concern to the opposition is this: I asked Senator McMullan on Wednesday, 22 June last about these foreshadowed appointments and what Senator McMullan said was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When a series of appointments to the Special Broadcasting Service and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that have been put to the Governor-General are announced, those opposite will see that people from a range of political persuasions have been appointed to those boards, as should be the case.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator McMullan was saying that the appointments to the ABC board will reflect a range of political persuasions&mdash;but that is certainly not the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of tonight's belated announcement we have a board that consists of five persons with well-known Labor affiliations plus one trade union member. There are only nine members on the board so even ignoring the trade unionist&mdash;I suppose some of them vote for the Liberal Party&mdash;we have a board with a clear majority of people whose main claim to fame is that they have strong and longstanding Labor Party affiliations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That will come as a great disappointment to all those who are looking to the government to take this opportunity to make appointments to the board on the basis of merit and to boost the community standing and reputation of the ABC. Instead, we now have a board in serious danger of becoming a third-rate outfit, the main claim to fame of which is that the majority of its members have Labor Party associations. This blatant board stacking exercise endangers the independence and integrity of the ABC and has the potential to do grave danger to Australia's international reputation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not yet received any acknowledgment from the Governor-General of my letter to him several days ago expressing concern that the foreshadowed appointments appeared to be in breach of the statutory obligation imposed on the government, which I think makes the case very clear:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person shall not be appointed as a Director&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and we are talking about non-executive directors&mdash;unless that person:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting or television services or in communications or management. . . </PARA>
<PARA>So appointees need either a broadcasting or television background or a communications and management background. It goes on to say for either of those criteria that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . by reason of his having expertise in financial or technical matters, or by reason of his having cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organisation engaged in the provision of broadcasting and television services.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, a person's qualifications have to be very closely aligned with the job for which they are chosen. Someone cannot simply wander in and say, `I've got a bit of a background in management, a bit of an understanding of community welfare, therefore I deserve to be appointed to the board.' Yet that is what the minister thinks ought to happen. He said that Ms Wendy Silver:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . is chairman of a major public sector authority under the auspices of the current Liberal state government in Western Australia. I think she is entitled to be judged on the performance which we expect her to make.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fact is that she is not chairman of any board; she is not entitled to be judged on the performance we would expect her to make. Her main claim to fame, apart from handing out how-to-vote cards on behalf of the ALP in the last state election&mdash;</PARA>

This matter should have gone to the Executive Council last Monday. It finally went to the Executive Council this morning. We have been waiting all day for a formal announcement and, as I indicated at the beginning of my speech, we only got the release from the minister's office tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That in itself, I would have thought, is a flagrant breach of any obligation to keep the parliament informed, but it is also a very clear admission of guilt on the part of the government. In other words, it knows that these appointments will not stand the scrutiny of the public and it is not going to have them raised in the parliament. Therefore, on the point of order, I think it is very clear that the only way in which this matter is going to be raised is right now before the parliament adjourns for a period of some seven weeks. </PARA>

It is no longer the Australian Broadcasting Corporation; it is the `Labor Party Broadcasting Corporation'. With the now confirmed appointments of Mr Bannon and Ms Silver we have seen a blatant determination by this government to stack the board of the ABC.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Alston said in moving this motion, which I second, there are now five out of the nine non-employed directors of the ABC with close links to the Labor movement. We have already got Les Hingley, the federal secretary of the Australian Bank Employees' Union and an executive member of the ACTU, on the board. We have former Labor pollster Rod Cameron. Tonight we have had Janine Walker, an industrial officer with the Queensland branch of the AWU, reappointed. Janine Walker is also a failed Labor Party candidate in addition to her union links. Tonight, in the last minutes of the parliamentary sitting, to avoid the parliamentary scrutiny of these appointments, we have the official announcement of the appointment of Mr Bannon and Ms Silver. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does the minister say about the appointments in this press release? He says that Mr Bannon will bring a strong background in government and community affairs to the ABC board. What a joke! He also says that Ms Silver has proven financial expertise and a comprehensive background in public sector administration and welfare issues. In the earlier debate on this issue we have seen only too clearly Mr Bannon's lack of expertise. He is the major figure in the collapse of the State Bank, which has cost South Australians $3 billion, and was hounded from office in disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ms Silver was a political apparatchik for the Labor Party in Western Australia and an adviser to the Burke Labor government, which was another government hounded from office in disgrace. These are the sorts of people that this government is putting on the board of the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Who is the government dispensing with? The only person with any commercial or communications technology expertise&mdash;Mr Michael Terlet. In this press release there is not one mention of the stirling service that Mr Terlet has given to the board of the ABC. Because of this desperate need to stack the ABC board with Labor appointees, the government is too embarrassed to mention that it is sacking Mike Terlet, who is the only man who has any real capacity to contribute to that board.

What is he going to bring to the board in terms of providing any direction or any focus for the ABC, particularly in these times when it is heading into the high risk commercial areas such as pay TV, satellite television into Asia and all the rest of those issues that are currently before the board?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly about the economic links between Australia and Chile. I had hoped that Senator McMullan would have been able to return by today so that I could address a question to him in question time in the Senate. But on his having not returned I put the question now in the terms that I had prepared it. I ask that when Senator McMullan does return he, together with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade officers, gives careful attention to maximising the three points that I make.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My question was directed to the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan. I refer to Australia's economic relationship with Chile, the country in South America with the most prospective trade and investment opportunities for Australia and a country which will become, in November, the newest member of APEC. I wish to ask the minister: first, in addition to our efforts in the GATT and in APEC, why should Australia not secure a bilateral free trade agreement with Chile&mdash;a positive opportunity which our CER partner New Zealand is, I understand, completing this week and stealing a march on us?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, what political clout will the government now give to ensure that Qantas and Lan Chile conclude a direct air link between Australia and Chile, a transport corridor essential for Australia taking up our best opportunities in Latin America? Thirdly, will the minister commission a Garnaut style specific economic and trade study by the analytical unit within DFAT of Chile and neighbouring Latin American economies on which an Australian business and trade strategy can better be established?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starting point for my question, and for what I now urge, is the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on Latin America which has been welcomed as one of the best researched reports undertaken in this parliament and for which the response of the government was overwhelmingly positive. There was an important sense of direction given in this report and, in particular, in the some 70 recommendations. The government is seeking to implement those recommendations and that sense of direction as substantially as it can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right at this juncture there are three particular aspects of our links with one crucial country in Latin America, Chile, to which my question is addressed. The first concerns a bilateral free trade agreement. This past week we have seen the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) rightly discussing Australia and New Zealand joining the ASEAN Free Trade Association. President Suharto has expressed a welcome for that in Indonesia in the discussions in recent days. Similarly, other ASEAN members have welcomed that. It may mean that there is a mini regional agreement for a wider free trade agreement between the ASEAN six and Australia and New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, for many years now we have had a free trade agreement with New Zealand. The CER partnership is well established and I believe that it is also, to some extent, a feature of our special relationship with New Guinea and with other countries in the south Pacific. But we have not, to this point, established any bilateral free trade agreement with a Latin American country. The most prospective two countries are Chile and Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mexico now has a free trade agreement in NAFTA with the United States and Canada, and NAFTA is looking south to possibly include Chile. It is undoubtedly the case that Chile has the most disciplined and sound economy amongst the South American countries. It is a country which is looking to build a bilateral relationship with Australia&mdash;a relationship which is innovative and which will maximise the best interests of Australia and Chile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Chile sees itself as going through an Australian door and making inroads into the whole of Asia, not just South-East Asia. Similarly, Chile is saying to Australia that it is a door through which Australians can go to South America. Now that there are 100 Australian companies with offices in the capital of Santiago and a huge amount of Australian investment in that country, we have trade and investment links that can be wrapped up with a bilateral free trade agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Up until now my urging and the urging of others in both houses of parliament for bilateral free trade agreements have fallen on rather deaf ears. But I am enormously encouraged by the fact that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Senator Gareth Evans and Senator McMullan have now taken a positive approach to examining the merits of a bilateral free trade agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For too long we have put all our eggs in the GATT and APEC baskets. We have neglected the advantages we might pick up from a one to one agreement with prospective countries. The time for that has come and the country that Australia should include in such an agreement is Chile. I urge Minister McMullan and his department during this winter break to map out that relationship. I know that not only is Chile in favour of such an agreement but it is also making requests of Australia to conclude such an agreement. New Zealand has already gone along that path and will be making such an agreement this week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, recommendation No. 27 of the Senate report urged Qantas and Lan Chile to come to an agreement. Over the last two years there have been very useful talks between the two airlines and, to some extent, with the Commonwealth transport department. Only for a disagreement over five or 10 seats on one flight a week, no agreement has been finalised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the government to use some political clout in this matter. For the sake of the whole relationship between Australia and Latin America, it is important that this transport corridor is established in addition to the one established between New Zealand and Argentina. I believe that with the use of political clout and good reasoning Qantas and Lan Chile can conclude a direct air link. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, we saw this week&mdash;especially in the hands of the Prime Minister on his visit to Jakarta&mdash;an important study on Australia-Indonesia economic relations published by the East Asia Analytical Unit. This study follows others: one earlier this year into Australia's commercial links with India, with a trade and investment strategy for Australians in India; the famous study on Korea; and before that, the Garnaut report into Australia's relations with East Asia&mdash;hence the name of the unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Expertise, professionalism, vision and energy has been put together in this analytical unit and I ask the minister for his department to give a direct reference to this unit to look at the relationship between Chile and Australia and through Chile to neighbouring countries. I believe that by the time Chile is admitted to APEC in November it would be extraordinarily strategic if we could conclude these three matters so that we could have an established link on which the rest of the region might build to the great advantage of Australia and Chile. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise tonight to speak briefly about and give support to the thousands of people in country New South Wales and Queensland who are again battling very dry conditions. We get very cut off from real Australia in Canberra. That is especially so with country Australia, which is suffering not only from low commodity prices but also, a large part of it, from drought again. Almost half of New South Wales is now officially engulfed by drought. This could reduce Australia's export earnings by over $1 billion as it cannot be alleviated fully for at least three months due to seasonal factors and the fact that we are now well into winter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite light falls of rain in the past few days, the percentage of New South Wales that is drought declared has risen from 34 per cent in June to 45 per cent in July. The north of the state is in dire straits, but the dry conditions are spreading south and now include Sydney, Forbes, Young, Molong, the Hunter Valley and right through the north-west of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the north-west area, around Tamworth, thousands of head of stock have been sent out of the area on agistment, if it can be found, and most property owners are supplementary feeding. The water resources department has announced that it is likely that there will be no irrigation water supplied in either of the Namoi or Gwydir valleys next season because of the drought. This means losses of hundreds of millions of dollars in agricultural production, particularly cotton, which has had a couple of very difficult years although it has had reasonably high prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Continuing dry weather coupled with high levels of farm indebtedness will have major consequences for family farms and rural commodities right through New South Wales. The onset of the colder winter weather means that frosts will impair pasture growth for at least three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Darling River, one of the lifebloods of the west of the state, has all but stopped flowing and it has been so long since any significant rain has fallen that the ground water throughout the area is fast disappearing. Dams are drying up and graziers are being forced to make some difficult decisions about whether to feed stock all winter or sell them on depressed markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wheat crop more than ever has been reduced to a lottery. Growers have run out of time, but are expected to take a gamble and sow a total of 3.8 million hectares of winter crops this year, compared with 3.7 million hectares last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As stated in a New South Wales Farmers press release yesterday, this drought exposes the failings of the federal government, which decreed in 1990 that drought was no longer a natural disaster. Labor did not continue the traditional financial support to primary industry that allowed farmers to put money aside in the good times to see them through the bad times, once provided by the IED scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in our capital cities, including key decision makers, are very isolated from the reality of drought, but it impacts on every single Australian. I think the budget forecasts and the growth forecasts will suffer dramatically from this dry period that has engulfed the eastern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One-third of our export income still comes from rural exports. Without these export dollars the standards of living of each and every Australian will certainly not be maintained but will fall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought means that there will be a drop-off in grain revenues, a reduction in wool export income, whilst the price is starting to improve. There is some optimism there. The actual level of production will be restricted by this dry time. Cotton income, as I mentioned, will be substantially reduced and the volume of beef and sheepmeats will also be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can only hope for widespread rains to bring relief to the agriculture sector before too much longer because drought will always remain a very stark reminder that we are all ultimately in the cradle of nature. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly tonight about 12 Gurkhas who are in Australia at the moment seeking permanent residency. The Gurkhas are hillmen from Nepal. They have served in regiments in the British Army for 180 years, and also in the Indian Army after 1948. Gurkhas fought alongside the Australian forces in Gallipoli, France, Palestine, North Africa, Burma, Malaysia and Singapore. They have been the free world's allies for over 175 years, they have been wonderful friends to Australia throughout that period and they have received 26 Victoria Crosses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gurkhas in question&mdash;as I say, there are only 12 of them&mdash;are currently in Australia and living in Gippsland. They have had their applications for refugee status rejected, and I understand the reasons for that. Seven other Gurkhas were recently granted permanent residence under the humanitarian program. So, of the 19, seven have been granted permanent residence under the humanitarian program, and the remaining 12 are now applying for permanent residence under the same program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have a great deal of support from their local community. The Moe, Morwell and Traralgon city councils have voted to support the Gurkhas' application, and have said publicly that they would be more than welcome to stay permanently in their communities and that they would make a very beneficial contribution to those communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Gurkhas as a group have had a long association with the people of Gippsland, which is also the home of the Australian Light Horse Regiment, which first fought alongside the Gurkhas in Palestine. Their application is also strongly supported by the RSL in Australia. It is supported by the National President of the RSL, Major-General `Digger' James, and the president of the RSL in Victoria, Mr Bruce Ruxton&mdash;indeed, there is wide support throughout the RSL membership.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In light of the fact that seven Gurkhas have already been accepted on humanitarian grounds, I hope that the minister will look very sympathetically at the application for humanitarian status and permanent residence under the humanitarian category for the remaining 12.

<PARA>Any question of entry into Australia, particularly in the humanitarian and refugee categories, is a difficult one for decision; but I hope that there is scope for commonsense to prevail in our consideration of these issues.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not have the opportunity to take note of Senator Faulkner's answer during question time today, but I want to put on the record my disappointment that, as the environment minister, he did not answer the supplementary questions I asked regarding the effects of his plans for Tasmania. When I made the comment that I was a fourth generation Tasmanian, Senator Collins interjected across the chamber, `And it shows.' I presume that in his usual generous manner Senator Collins was paying me a compliment, and I thank him for that. I also thank Senator Faulkner for jogging my memory, because in his reply to my earlier question he said that I had the opportunity to talk to him yesterday in the chamber, but I cannot remember talking to Senator Faulkner in this place during the last two weeks. Nevertheless, I must be wrong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my supplementary question, I asked why Tasmania suffers every time we have a change of environment minister. I would like to put on the record that I remember very well when former Senator Richardson became the minister for the environment. The first thing he did was lock up 20 per cent of Tasmania in World Heritage. He certainly made a name for himself as an environment minister. I do not believe he did it for any sane reason. At that time the Helsham inquiry was set up. Those people who sat on the Helsham inquiry were recommended by the Green movement. I remind the Senate that those in the Green movement recommended the Helsham inquiry and the people who were to sit on that inquiry. The Helsham inquiry recommended locking up 30,000 hectares of Tasmania. Former Senator Richardson, in his wisdom as a new environment minister, ended up locking up 330,000 hectares of Tasmania, and that is where it all started. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, Ros Kelly took over the position of environment minister. One of the first things she did was close down Benders Quarry in the World Heritage area. She did it because it was one of those things where she could get a lot of headlines and make a name for herself&mdash;like every new minister does&mdash;at the expense of the Tasmanian population. The people who suffered because of that were the fruit growers in southern Tasmania and they still are suffering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then Senator Schacht became the new minister for science. The first thing he did was come down to Tasmania&mdash;he had never been there before&mdash;to see what the CSIRO was doing. He decided that he was going to make a name for himself by combining the CSIRO with the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Queensland. He certainly made a name for himself because the rest of his colleagues in cabinet realised what a fool he was making of himself, and he backed off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Now, in the first few weeks of his new job as the minister for environment, Senator Faulkner has a big breakfast and tells everybody what he is going to do in Tasmania. He is going to lock up the so-called Tarkine area, stop woodchipping by the year 2000 and do all these wonderful things. But the only thing he did not do was talk to his Tasmanian senators and members and, from what I can understand, he did not talk to his cabinet colleagues. He made an absolute fool of himself. Today we have Mrs Silvia Smith from the Labor Party and on behalf of the Labor Party getting a lot of coverage in Tasmania defending Tasmania; we have Senator Murphy from the Labor Party and on behalf of the Labor Party defending logging in Tasmania; and we have everybody jumping on the bandwagon trying to defend Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite honestly, I have seen it all before. I just hope that Senator Faulkner, like his predecessors in this portfolio, has learnt his lesson. I also put on the record that I did ask Senator Faulkner whether he was going to use the external affairs powers. I did not ask him whether he was going to use to spy flights&mdash;like somebody else did in the early days&mdash;to check out things down there. Given the way he has been savaged by his colleagues from Tasmania, Senator Faulkner might have second thoughts about what he had planned for Tasmania. I have seen what has happened. I have seen the jobs that have been lost and I have seen the uncertainty in the community. As a fourth generation Tasmanian I hope that, for the sake of commonsense and sanity, Senator Faulkner has a second think about all this and approaches his portfolio&mdash;as far as Tasmania is concerned, anyway&mdash;in a more sane manner. </PARA>

The Therapeutic Goods Administration officials said, `These trials are only clinical trial notifications.

When I asked what trials they were, they gave me and the committee two clinical trial notifications: one by the Sydney Centre for Reproductive Health Research, which shared the same address as the Family Planning Association of New South Wales, which was endorsed by an ethics committee, namely the Family Planning Association of NSW ethics committee. On that ethics committee was the manager of the Sydney reproductive health centre, the organisation which was undertaking the trial. In my view, that is totally unethical. Yet the Therapeutic Goods Administration accepted that because that is what the law is. </PARA>

There were breaches of the corporations law and dishonest and disgraceful returns which had to be corrected. They were false in material features and had to be corrected to the tune of multi-millions of dollars. Not once in all the times these matters have been raised has this Prime Minister dissociated himself from the illegal and improper actions of his agent, the man he entrusted with the running of his 50 per cent owned piggery. That man is Mr Achilles Constantinidis. </PARA>

By the way, he lodged them only after the failure was revealed in the parliament. I wonder what sort of action the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) intends to take to ensure that the penalties imposed by the securities commission for breaches of the corporations law relating to accurate and timely annual returns are paid.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No genetically engineered foods have yet been approved for sale to the public in Australia. Proposals to perform genetic manipulation work in Australia require assessment by the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) in accordance with the GMAC guidelines. Proposals to grow genetically engineered food crops outside of containment facilities fall under the GMAC Guidelines for the Planned Release of Genetically Manipulated Organisms. GMAC has assessed several such proposals, but none of these has progressed beyond the stage of small-scale field trials. The crops covered by these proposals are:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. Currently the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee (GMAC) is responsible for overseeing genetic manipulation work in Australia, so that any biosafety risk factors associated with the technology are identified and can be managed. In its response to the report of the Parliamentary inquiry into genetically modified organisms in October 1992, the Government noted that GMAC's Guidelines had been effective and should be given legal force through the establishment of a new statutory authority.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Responsibility for the health and safety aspects of foods lies with the National Food Authority (NFA). The NFA will assess foods produced using gene technology in terms of the property of the food itself and not on the process used in its production.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In June 1993, the NFA prepared a proposal (Proposal 97) to amend the Food Standards Code to regulate foods produced using gene technology. The objectives of this proposal were to ensure that all new products of gene technology intended for use as food or food components would be referred to the NFA, on a case by case basis, to enable an assessment of their safety for human consumption. The proposal is currently undergoing a full assessment.</PARA>
