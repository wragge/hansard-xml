<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst principally a communications inquiry, the terms of reference cover the full range of the Committee's areas of responsibility. The impact of telecommunications developments on industry, employment and the community is the focus of the inquiry. This paper expands on the points set out in the terms of reference and is provided to assist in the preparation of submissions to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee seeks information on the technology that is currently available in Australia and overseas and anticipated developments. The information obtained will be set out in the first section of the report and will provide the reference material for the consideration of the remaining points of the terms of reference. While the information super highway with its potential for associated services will attract much attention, the Committee will also look at whether existing technologies and information services are being fully utilised, as well as methods to improve knowledge of existing services and how best to prepare for change. Further, the Committee will examine how users in industry and the community will cope with the plethora of information and the range of hardware and software offered to help gain access to it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee is particularly interested in how industry will benefit from the access to information as well as the business opportunities that will emerge. The use that developing or emerging industries will make of these opportunities will be closely examined and an assessment of the costs and benefits sought. The Committee will also seek input from all levels of industry about how it sees its demands for technology and information being met and whether the providers of technology are responding to that demand or driving it. In this regard the role of very large international telecommunications companies with their ability to dominate markets will be examined to determine the consequences for small but innovative Australian telecommunications companies. The Committee will pay particular attention to the usefulness of new communications technologies to small to medium sized businesses, both in terms of meeting their needs and costs, and the level of training and support needed. The role that the Australian Parliament can play in providing leadership through creating a forum for debate about how best to support innovative Australian telecommunications companies and, ultimately, the nature of a legislative regime that would support them will also be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The potential for changes to work practices through the use of telecommunications technology is only just beginning to be understood. The Committee wants to identify the possibilities and assess their impact. Opportunities for employment in research, manufacture and implementation of new communications technologies as well as training needs will also be examined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most profound change as a consequence of access to new communications technologies will be social and cultural. The Committee requires information to allow it to assess the nature of change to home life by the year 2000 and beyond. The opportunities this will open up for people in remote areas for access to information and entertainment, as well as the ability to work and interact with people in any part of the nation or indeed internationally, will change the way of life in these areas. Similarly, in the cities it will be possible to work from home (with implications for childcare), shop from home and be entertained in the home. Improved communications technologies will also benefit older Australians and, given the increased proportion of elderly people as a percentage of the population early next century, the Committee will be examining how they can access the technologies in an affordable way.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question of affordability is not restricted to the elderly. The Committee seeks information about how to make the benefits of the new technologies available to the majority of Australians. For society to maximise the benefits of the new technologies it has to have access and this issue will be central to the Committee's inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee seeks information from universities about their research and teaching programs and their contribution to the community debate on telecommunications and future technologies. In addition to hearing about the nature of the research the Committee wishes to examine the interaction of universities and the corporate sector in the development and/or use of the new technologies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, the Committee will look at the legislative and policy framework that will support the new technologies to see if it is appropriate to meet the needs discussed above. Indeed, the role the Parliament can play in initiating the public discussion and in determining or guiding the developments in new communications technologies will be closely examined. An example of this may be to ensure that privacy issues are considered and that a regulatory regime is in place. Therefore, the Committee seeks information about any privacy implications relating to the matters raised in the terms of reference.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter was referred to the committee on 27 May 1993. Since that date we have received more than 170 submissions and held public hearings in six states and territories. In addition, the committee visited several universities and had informal discussions with researchers, students, research pro vice chancellors, unions and the various academies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation and funding of research in higher education has been the subject of many inquiries, reviews and reports in recent years. Evidence to this committee largely mirrored the views expressed in these earlier reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recognition of the quality of research undertaken in the higher education sector was widespread. In several areas, the research places Australia at the forefront of international intellectual endeavour. It also contributes significantly to the quality of life of Australia's citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But equally widespread was concern about perceived threats to the continued viability of Australia's research effort. Some claim that these threats stem from the increased directing of research towards specified national social and economic goals. Others believe that the threat lies in the poor state of research infrastructure in the universities, and that, without a substantial and immediate increase in funding, the infrastructure will deteriorate dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the newer universities have benefited significantly from mechanism B infrastructure funding, and the committee has recommended that mechanism B continue for the 1994-96 triennium. But there has been an exponential increase in the costs of infrastructure which has placed a severe strain on the public funds that are available to universities as a whole. The problem has been compounded by the enormous expansion in the higher education sector. It is not only research, but also teaching which is under considerable pressure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee spent some time addressing issues arising from the operations of the Australian Research Council. The ARC performs an extremely difficult job with very little support by way of administrative backup, and relies heavily on the goodwill of the research community to carry out the peer assessment of research proposals which is central to the ARC role. We have made several recommendations which should improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the ARC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee also addressed the question of balance between various areas of research, and examined the links between industry and the universities, and the various programs which have been devised to encourage and support such links. There are several questions which arise concerning the best arrangements for enabling universities to carry out their prime tasks of fundamental research and high level teaching, while also contributing to the development and commercialisation of research results. The committee has explored these matters in some depth and framed recommendations which we believe will assist in achieving that balance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude by emphasising the committee's unanimous endorsement of the report's recommendations. Such agreement has been possible because each member of the committee has recognised the value of the universities' efforts in research, in the training of researchers, and in the teaching of undergraduates. We are agreed that our higher education sector must continue to make a major contribution to Australia's economic, social and cultural well-being, and to play an important part in the international research community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While acknowledging the legitimate claims of other education sectors on the limited public funding available, the committee concludes that the evidence provided during its inquiry amply justifies additional funds being provided in certain key areas. These funds should be regarded as fundamental investments in a major national resource, namely, the facilities and talent in our universities for high level research and teaching. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat for their magnificent effort in enabling this report to be tabled today. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the remarks made by Senator Zakharov. As she has indicated, this report on the organisation of funding of research in higher education was a unanimous report from both sides of the parliament. I was perhaps just a little disappointed by Senator Zakharov's press release and I hope she has a follow-up press release now that the report is tabled. In this press release she states that the report brings together some of the main themes and sets out a range of recommendations which will enhance the university research environment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, the report does far more than that and one of the things that the report reveals is that during the life of this government over the last 11 years, the whole university research and funding situation has been allowed to deteriorate at an alarming rate. Probably the area where this decline and deterioration have been greatest is in support infrastructure in the universities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1986 before the national unified system was created we had reports stating that university infrastructure had run down to a very alarming level. Of course, since the creation of the Dawkins national unified system, this whole trend has accelerated, because the universities&mdash;as everyone is aware&mdash;have expanded very rapidly over the last six or seven years, with placements up about 40 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Research has increased over this time as well, but what have not increased at a proportional rate are the resources available to support those efforts in both teaching and research. Indeed, what the report highlighted&mdash;and what we found everywhere we went around Australia&mdash;was the alarming extent of this rundown in infrastructure, and I will give honourable senators one example that perhaps best illustrates that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the quality assessment reports the University of Adelaide came in group one. When we were there, the University of Adelaide highlighted the extent of the rundown in its infrastructure with the story of the Barr Smith Library, which actually excluded for three months people who were not enrolees at that university. The reason why the university did this was that it just did not have the resources in its budget&mdash;particularly in its library budget&mdash;for the payment of people to re-stack books on shelves. On that basis, for three months, students&mdash;and I assume particularly students from the University of South Australia, which is very close by and who used the Barr Smith Library, which is a very good library&mdash;were excluded from the library. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is third world stuff when it starts to happen in Australian universities and it should ring alarm bells everywhere. For most academics their laboratory is actually the library, particularly in the social sciences and the humanities. We had examples where university departments were told, `You have to cancel three journals this year. It is your choice; we will leave it to you. But you have to cancel three'. The cost of library journals and books is going up faster than the inflation rate, but the resources are not going up to meet it. There is a national crisis in this country in higher education in libraries, but also in other basic research infrastructure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me read to the chamber what some of the leading academics told us about the state of their infrastructure. A report commissioned by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are few prizes for being second best, for being trained in steam driven technologies in the nuclear age.</PARA>
<PARA>When we go around and look at the facilities, as I have at the University of Adelaide, we find academics are struggling to stay in the world lead because they do not have the correct tools or the up-to-date tools to do the research that they need to do. In another group 1 university, the University of Melbourne, Professor Pilbrow in the department of physics said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . our nuts and bolts have run out of thread and we do not have the basic funding to do basic work. We see this to be a fairly immediate impact of the clawback&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of government research funding into the ARC. Professor Gilbert, from the standing committee on research of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A nation's research basis is like its roads, its bridges, its ports, its airports, its communications and its other infrastructure more generally. Letting it run down amounts to culpable neglect on the part of national decision makers.</PARA>
<PARA>This run-down of research infrastructure was addressed by a government commissioned report. It was called the Boston report because the Boston Consulting Group prepared it for NBEET. It documented the extent of this run-down in our research infrastructure and it recommended an immediate injection of funds of $125 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the last budget we saw the government's response to that report; it was an expenditure of under $5 million across 36 universities. This will do nothing to bring back the system from the brink of collapse and this is why the committee has recommended that the findings of the Boston Consulting Group be implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other things about the research environment that are of great concern. The positive thing we found as we went around was the high-class research work that people were doing. We saw how Australian research can be at the forefront but it is not going to be there if people do not have the proper backing and the proper tools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most disturbing things we found relating to that was that when first-class researchers put in projects they not only had inadequate infrastructure to support them, but because of the inadequacy of the funding levels for research in universities they had a very low chance of success. The main mechanism for distributing large research grants in Australia is through the Australian Research Council. The government did not provide additional funding to create all this initially, it actually&mdash;and the expression is used in the system&mdash;clawed it back. It is called the clawback. It took a proportion of research money from each of the universities and redistributed it on the basis of excellence and national priorities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People were broadly happy with that system, but what they are deeply unhappy about is that their chance of success when putting a first-class project to the ARC to be funded has dropped to the alarming level of 19 per cent. That means four out of every five projects get knocked back. We are not saying every project should be funded but we have got a situation where, on a rough rule of thumb, they are saying that 40 per cent deserve funding yet only half that are getting funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an incredible waste of resources and talent and the possibilities that come from research in our system. If we knock back projects at that rate it is just so short-sighted. Some of those research projects in the fields across the universities can produce discoveries that not only add to the sum of human happiness&mdash;particularly in areas that lead to prevention of disease&mdash;but also have the opportunity of creating great wealth for the country. Who would have thought of what would flow from the invention of the microchip at Stanford University. Look at the effect of that on the whole shape of our world and on the shape of technology. Look at the cash flows that have come in from that one small invention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the medical research area we have seen the prevention of polio by the advent of the Salk and Sabin vaccine. That one discovery has saved the medical systems of the world enough money to pay for all the medical research that has ever been done. How many discoveries have we missed in this country because of that sort of short-sightedness? In the moments remaining I would like to say that this report has shown the inadequacies of the system. We really need to have the recommendations implemented. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This is a moderate and sensible proposition in terms of the business of the Senate today. Senator Schacht said a little earlier this morning that it was the government's intention to adjourn tonight at 10.30 p.m. if at all possible, and I believe there ought to be, within that time frame, sufficient time to complete the government's program of essential legislation. There is, of course, as often occurs, some doubt about that. I am not willing to stand up here and give an ironclad commitment that we will be able to complete the full program of essential legislation by 10.30 p.m. I do not make those sorts of commitments lightly, and it is possible, of course, that a little more time might be required.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition is dissatisfied with the explanation that has been given by the Manager of Government Business in the Senate (Senator Faulkner). It demonstrates the continuing incompetence of the government in the management of its program. This year's Senate sittings were broken into three sittings so that bills could be carried over to a subsequent sitting if they could not be dealt with within the sitting in which they were put down for debate. There is only a short break until the Senate resumes at the beginning of May. If there is legislation that is not completed today there is no reason why it cannot be completed then.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the background to this. What we find now, however, contrary to all the assertions that the government made just a month or so ago when it brought in this new timetable, with its friends the Australian Democrats and the Greens, is that&mdash;for the second time this week&mdash;it wants to breach the time structure that it had imposed upon the Senate. It wants to do that with no good explanation at all, because the minister has not sought to explain, firstly, why these bills must be carried today or, secondly, why they could not have been done last week when the government chose other priorities beyond that of the legislative program. </PARA>

However, last week, all of a sudden&mdash;again because of a deal it had done with the Australian Democrats&mdash;it became critical and had priority ahead of all government legislation. Today, of course, what is critical is the government legislation and the Senate has to come back and sit late tonight to achieve that. A month ago we were told that that was unwise because it is unhealthy. There was concern for the health, not only of senators&mdash;probably not so important&mdash;but of staff and officials around this place. There was also concern about the cost of sitting late at night. All sorts of sensible reasons were argued as to why there should be an 8.00 p.m. cut off for the Senate&mdash;and now we have, twice in one week, the government coming in and saying, `We are not going to apply our own rules; we are going to apply new conditions'.</PARA></TALK.START>

If that is again going to take priority this afternoon over legislation, is the government expecting the Senate to sit late tonight to facilitate its valedictories? Valedictories ought to be on the adjournment.

There is a term that has crept into this place&mdash;it has been referred to twice by Senator Panizza, today and yesterday&mdash;regarding the Democrats and the Greens `rolling over'. I would like Senator Panizza to clarify the meaning of that term. I want him immediately to deny any sexist overtones. When the Liberal Party votes with the Labor Party, as it often does, is it also rolling over? I believe this is a democracy.

I would not have been willing to do that if it were not for the opposition. The opposition has presented the best argument I can think of to extend business hours because of the way its members behaved on Tuesday night, calling quorums every 15 minutes. I believe it is the mutual responsibility of the members of this Senate to review the legislation that has been provided to this place from the House of Representatives. We have all defended that at different times. I believe we are letting down our own parliamentary responsibilities by using it as a point-scoring exercise. </PARA>

We had business last week to do with senators' interests; it has been on the books for some 10 or 11 years. It was considered important enough to take up 2 1/2 hours of valuable time to debate that as part of a deal that was done with the government by the minor parties&mdash;yes, they rolled over again.

Part of that is because both you, as a member of the Greens, and the Democrats do not even bother with some of the institutions of this chamber. You do not bother to go to estimates committees, where we on this side of the chamber legitimately question the spending of the budget and the legitimate spending of taxpayers' money.

I find it very difficult to understand the motives of the Democrats and the Greens, who supported the view that the chamber should finish no later than 8 o'clock, for the sake of my health. Yet as soon as the government puts a little bit of pressure on to get some business through&mdash;which this week is important but last week was not important, because there were other things it wanted to put on the agenda&mdash;they agree.

We do attempt to attend as many as required to obtain information from them. On the health issue, I give as an example the drug RU486. I had asked question after question about that at the estimates committee and I had received a response from the department. I know that it was departmental policy that that abortifacient drug would not be imported into Australia because it was a prohibited import, unless the secretary had consulted with the Minister for Health. The secretary has not consulted with the minister on this particular occasion. But does that mean that I had to attend every estimates committee since 1989-90 when that undertaking was given?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to put a few questions to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Multicultural Affairs (Senator Bolkus). The reason why we are debating this bill is that the government was forced to defer the implementation of the major changes introduced in the Migration Reform Act in December 1992 because it subsequently found a large number of technical and other corrections that needed to be made to that legislation. Hence, the implementation date, which was to have been 1 November 1993, was put off for a further 10 months until 1 September 1994. So, as I said in the second reading debate, we have the extraordinary situation that a bill is being implemented almost two years after it was introduced but at the time of its introduction it was said by the government to be urgently required. There is a fundamental inconsistency in that situation. It reflects gross sloppiness, at best, and incompetence, at worst, in terms of the administration of this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Initially I ask the minister: when the government considered its decision to delay the implementation date of the Migration Reform Act, was the government conscious of the impending decisions, which were taken a couple of months afterwards, with respect to the People's Republic of China nationals and/or the boat people? I am referring particularly to the special assistance category that was determined for the Cambodian people just before the November decisions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We were conscious that the issues were alive and running. Senator Short was one of those who, at the time, were calling on us to address the issue of PRC nationals and to do so sooner rather than later. I think I am on record a number of times&mdash;at the particular time that we had to address deferring the legislation&mdash;as saying that I would like to address the decision on PRC nationals earlier rather than later. The boat people decision has been an ongoing one, as the parliament knows. It is one that I worked through exhaustively in the first 12 months in this portfolio. It has been with me from day one, I suppose, when matters relating to that decision became very prominent in my considerations. So, yes, those two issues were always around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The request I made to the secretary, and he developed this request with me, to assess the adequacy of implementation resources and capacity of the legislation was a decision we made very early in the piece. I think it was within the first few weeks of my being in the portfolio. I was very keen then to ensure that, when the legislation came into place, it could work effectively and adequately. So the three decisions were always with us. I do not know what Senator Short is trying to get at. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Had the MRA come into effect on the originally scheduled date of 1 November 1993, the judicial review provisions&mdash;which contain a welcome tightening up of the access to judicial review&mdash;would have had effect from that date and therefore would have had an effect on the situation of PRC and other nationals. I assumed that the minister and the government&mdash;given the timings that were then in place&mdash;would have had legislation in place which would have posed a different situation, particularly in relation to Chinese nationals and others, from what now pertains, given that the implementation date has been stretched out to September of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>

What impact will that delay in the implementation of judicial review provisions have on those groups? On the face of it&mdash;I seek the minister's confirmation or otherwise on this&mdash;it means that many thousands of people are now going to be subject to the generous judicial review provisions that pertained prior to the MRA, which they would not have been subject to had the start-up date of 1 November 1993 been adhered to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The judicial review is something that I have not only discussed in here but also managed to discuss outside of this place with Senator Short, and others, on a number of occasions. One particular focus that Senator Short wanted us to take at an early stage was for us to separate the judicial review aspects from the rest of the legislation, and have them apply from 1 September, deferring the rest of the legislation. That factor was taken into account by the government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We considered whether that could be done and the best advice that we all had, which was produced to this parliament, was that separation was not easy, if it were at all possible, given not just provisions of the legislation, but also the interlocking principles of law that would be applied by courts, the effect of which would have been to negate any effect that early implementation of provisions in respect of judicial review would have taken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we have always considered this aspect of judicial review but what we have done, in a comprehensive response in this particular area, was to set up the Refugee Review Tribunal, a tribunal which has as a very major objective the reduction of successful appeals, because of its independence and because of the stature it brings to an independent review body in this particular area. We have always taken into account the effects of judicial review and it has always been something that we have been prepared to discuss but, as I say, the establishment of the RRT is for us the focal point where we anticipate that appeals can be heard and finalised&mdash;and finalised in such a way that they are sustainable if one were to take the case any further for judicial review. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the minister's view on the significance of the Refugee Review Tribunal, but that is a somewhat different point. The point I am making is that by deferring from 1 November 1993 to 1 September 1994, the start-up date for the changes that are being made to the judicial review provisions and others&mdash;but at this stage I am talking about the judicial review provisions&mdash;he has, therefore, enabled many thousands of people who would otherwise have been subject to the tighter judicial review provisions to continue to be subjected to the more generous previous provisions. I am asking: what does the government see as the impact of that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The short answer is that the government anticipated whether, under the MRA or without the MRA, people will still have rights of judicial review. It is just that, as we all know, those rights would have been reduced had the MRA had an earlier implementation. But to the extent that it has not had that early implementation, we anticipate that the existence of the RRT as an independent appeal body obviates the need, or makes the process much more sustainable against judicial review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think it can be said that a lesser number of people would have had review rights under an MRA which applied from September 1994. One can say&mdash;and I think Senator Short is aiming to&mdash;that the areas of review available to them would have been reduced under this act. We know that; that is part of the legislation. But we do say further that, to the extent that they have not been reduced, one of the objectives of the RRT has always been to ensure that appeals from internal decision making can go there and, by its presence and authority, that body could then be seen by the courts as a body which has independently heard review; as a consequence, judicial review would not open such decisions. What I am saying is that we think there is a mechanism in place to accommodate those areas that otherwise would have been precluded if the MRA had applied earlier, but applied in September 1994. </PARA>

As a member of that committee, I shall look with considerable interest at the minister's consideration of that report, which I think is an important report. I hope that the government will produce a response to that report in a far shorter time than its failure, to date, to produce any response to the committee's previous report, which has now been there since, I think, August 1992 and which also contains some important recommendations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to ask now a couple of questions in relation to the permanent protection visa, the 817 visa. With regard to the actual amendments proposed in the bill before us, there appears to me to be only one issue of any particular contention and that is the changing of the protection visas from temporary permits to permanent visas. That is a decision which has been supported by the coalition. We are not opposing it. But it can send differing signals to different potential applicants for refugee and humanitarian class of visas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I want to ask is: why was the decision regarding the 817 class of visa holders, which, as we know, makes the visas permanent rather than temporary, made in the context of the 1 November decision which resolved the outstanding issues of, in particular, the Chinese nationals? Was there any connection between the two issues?</PARA>

The decision to change to temporary protection status was one that was encompassed by the government at a time when temporary protection was granted also to the students who were here from the People's Republic of China at around that time. At that time the emphasis was on granting temporary protection, and that was applied to cover those who had been granted refugee status. Once again, Senator Short is talking about a response at that time which covered both the PRC nationals and refugees but which covered them by granting temporary protection, as opposed to a response some 4 1/2 years later which moved to the granting of permanent protection in respect of both areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think I am correct in saying that the Chinese student factor was not given as one of the reasons for the government's decision back in 1989 or thereabouts to make them temporary. I use as the basis for that statement the joint standing committee's report of August 1992, to which the government has not yet responded. On page 83 of that report the committee in its conclusions said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee accepts the need to move away from the old system in which on-shore refugees were automatically given permanent residence.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it was supporting the decision made in 1989. It goes on to say, although I have not heard that this is factually incorrect:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This change was forced upon the Government by the unprecedented rise in on-shore claims and the continuing unpredictability of on-shore refugee numbers Australia has on-going commitments to resettle off-shore refugee applicants&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In June 1989, for example, Australia agreed to resettle 11,000 Indo-Chinese refugees over three years under the Comprehensive Plan of Action. If such commitments are to be honoured, and if the Government is to retain control over refugee program numbers it necessitates placing on-shore refugees in a residents queue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday, during the debate on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1993, there was considerable discussion as to whether certain government amendments should be moved as requests. I remind the committee that requests are formally made by the Senate to the House of Representatives in respect of certain money bills with which the Senate has some difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government advice, if accepted, would tend, I believe, to have the effect of upsetting some long-term traditions about where bills which increase the burden on taxpayers could</PARA>
<PARA>originate. The traditional view is that money bills should originate in the people's house&mdash;in our case, the House of Representatives&mdash;rather than in the house of review, the Senate. I am always one for propriety of the Senate's rights, but I think we must be very careful as a house of review about intruding into so-called new territory in relation to money bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that acceptance of the opinions that the government has tendered has very widespread implications as to how in future the Senate may deal with tax legislation. I believe that the ramifications of such words in the opinion as `increasing the burden of tax' are not necessarily correct, although certainly wide ranging. I remind the Senate that, generally, high courts will adjudicate on issues generally involved in section 55 of the constitution, whereas section 53 items are generally to be resolved between the two houses of parliament on issues that affect them, their rights and responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue, I remind the committee, has been referred to and examined and reported upon by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. It has put down its opinion. I do not believe that referring the issue back to that committee will change the stance or the opinion or the report of that committee in any way. However, I do put it to the government, through Senator Cook, the minister responsible in this chamber, that I think it is incumbent on the government to examine further and resolve the issue and seek wider opinion, because we believe there are certain deficiencies in what has been tendered to us to date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the hour and the need to pass this legislation, we think that the appropriate measure to adopt is to move a declaratory amendment to the motion that the report be adopted. I indicate now that at the time the motion is moved that the report of the committee be adopted, we will move:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">", and the Senate declares that its agreement, on the motion of the government, to make requests to the House of Representatives for amendments of the bill does not indicate that the Senate considers that requests are appropriate or that the Senate has formed a conclusive view on the application of section 53 or 55 of the Constitution to the bill".</PARA>
<PARA>I draw the committee's attention to that at this point. I thank the government for the opportunity of considering the great amount of detail it provided yesterday to the Senate. Yesterday was not an appropriate time for adequate consideration, given the length of the opinions and the supplementary documents that were appended to those opinions. Overnight we have had the opportunity of referring those documents and those opinions to the Clerk of the Senate. The Clerk of the Senate had tendered me his advice. I take the opportunity of publicly thanking him for the quality of that advice. I will seek leave of the committee, for the purpose of expediting the debate, to incorporate that opinion in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. I suggest that Senator Cook may like to tender his advice that was circulated in the chamber yesterday and incorporate that in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. By so doing, the readers of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> can then draw their own conclusion as to the future direction, because the issue should be resolved. It is really an issue of the mechanism for the best resolution of the problem before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier that I do not wish to delay the passage of this bill, but I thank Senator Cook for giving us the opportunity of considering that. I also point out that the Clerk's view on those opinions, which we endorse, has been considered by our shadow Attorney-General, Daryl Williams QC, a man of considerable expertise, and by others. They concur with the views laid down by the Clerk, which we are seeking to incorporate in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> today. I regret that so much pressure was placed on so many people overnight on such an important and sensitive issue but, essentially, the issue was very much in the government's hands.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GOVERNMENT AMENDMENTS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As requested I have examined the brief advice dated 23 March 1994 from the Attorney-General's Department to the Commissioner for Taxation supporting the contention that certain of the government amendments to this bill should be moved as requests. This advice was in response to questions asked by Senators in debate and a note of 22 March 1994 which I sent to members of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of my note was simply to make the point that the moving of the government amendments in the form of requests again draws attention to the difficulties involved in the classification of taxation bills expounded by the government's legal advisers. These difficulties were explored in some depth in evidence before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee during its consideration of the taxation legislation arising from the budget last year. The view which was then put by the government's legal advisers to justify that legislation was basically that legislation could increase taxation without being legislation to impose taxation within the meaning of sections 53 and 55 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It was submitted to the Committee by various witnesses that this view should not be accepted, not only because it flies in the face of common sense, but because it was not soundly based on relevant judgments of the High Court and would probably not be accepted by the Court if the Court were given the opportunity definitively to determine the question. In my submission to the Committee I pointed out that this view would probably not be acceptable to the Court because it leads to absurdity. It leads, for example, to the following absurd conclusions: a bill can increase taxation without imposing taxation; a number of increases in different taxes can be combined in one bill; such a bill could be introduced in the Senate, but the Senate could not amend its own bill to increase further the taxation affected by the bill, and nor could such amendments be made by way of requests because the bill would not have come from the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The connection between these matters and the questions now arising in relation to this bill is that the interpretation of the third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution which is now put forward by the Attorney-General's Department, and which is the basis of some of the government amendments to the bill being moved in the form of requests, flows from the advice of the department in relation to the question of legislation imposing taxation arising under sections 53 and 55, and leads to the same kind of absurdity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I pointed out in my note of 22 March, this view involves the absurdities that a bill may not be a bill imposing taxation but an amendment to the bill may increase a "proposed charge or burden on the people" within the meaning of the third paragraph of section 53; and that the Senate may not be able to amend a bill which the Senate is nevertheless empowered to introduce (because it is not a bill imposing taxation).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice from the Attorney-General's Department now seeks to deal with these difficulties by declaring that a provision in a bill may increase a proposed charge or burden on the people without imposing taxation. This is consistent with the views put earlier by the department. The example given, however, is that a change making tax instalments payable weekly instead of monthly would increase the burden on taxpayers. Presumably such a change would not involve an increase in the total tax liability of a taxpayer. The explanation that was given to me by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for the amendments being moved in the form of requests is that they increase the tax liability of taxpayers; this is the line of argument taken in the other opinions accompanying the advice. It is consistent with the department's view that tax liability can be extended by a law which is not a law which imposes taxation within the meaning of the relevant constitutional provisions. The example now given appears to contemplate that a provision can increase a proposed charge or burden on the people without affecting the tax liability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This extends the application of the third paragraph of section 53 into a much more nebulous area than has hitherto been contemplated. It has always been thought that the third paragraph of section 53 refers to legislation if not imposing taxation at least affecting tax payable, and to legislation appropriating money. The word "proposed" in the third paragraph, which is a stumbling block to loose interpretation of the paragraph, is explained away as referring to a tax or an appropriation proposed to be affected by a bill. It now appears to be contemplated that a "charge or burden" may not relate to taxation actually payable or to appropriations but to a much wider and undefined area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Apart from this difficulty, there is still the other dimension of absurdity to which I have referred. Taking the example used by the Attorney-General's Department, the Senate could introduce a bill to provide that taxation instalments are payable weekly instead of monthly, but having introduced that bill would then be powerless to amend the bill to make the instalments payable daily instead of weekly, although it could introduce another bill to achieve that end. This interpretation turns the third paragraph of section 53 into an utterly empty procedural formality which does not even preserve the financial initiative of the House of Representatives, supposedly the main purpose of section 53.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the signed version of the advice of 23 March 1994 provided to Senators, at the end of paragraph 5, the following sentence occurs:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It follows that the Senate should not purport to increase rates set out in such a Bill [this refers to the example of a bill making tax instalments payable weekly instead of monthly] where that Bill originated in the House of Representatives."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sentence appears to be an attempt to overcome the difficulty to which I have referred, of the Senate not being able to amend its own bill while having the capacity to introduce a new bill containing the proposed amendments. The sentence implies that the third paragraph of section 53, as interpreted by the Attorney-General's Department, applies only to bills originating in the House of Representatives. This, however, involves a further absurdity: the restriction imposed by the third paragraph of section 53 would operate according to whether a bill had been introduced in the House of Representatives or the Senate, which would make it even more of a dead letter as a safeguard of the financial initiative of the House. The sentence also, by referring to increasing rates, glosses over the distinction between increasing the taxation payable and merely affecting the way in which the tax is paid, as in the example given in the advice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This sentence has been deleted from the version of the advice which was tabled in the Senate. I suggest that the sentence has been deleted because it was realised that it exposed the absurdity to which the Attorney-General's Department view leads.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As was strongly argued before the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, the arguments advanced by the government's legal advisers, which arise from their artificial classification of bills, put the interpretation of the relevant constitutional provisions in a state of confusion. As I indicated in my earlier note, this confusion could be avoided by adopting a different classification of bills for the purposes of sections 53 and 55, and a different and clearer interpretation of those sections, with less risk of challenge to legislation under section 55. If the matter is subjected to further investigation, I could make some suggestions as to how the confusion could be cleared up.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As suggested in paragraph 6 of the advice, the question of whether the Senate proceeds by way of amendment or request is probably not justiciable. As I have also suggested in previous advices, it also does not affect the substantive powers of the Senate. Therefore it may be of little consequence whether the Senate agrees to the course suggested by the government of making the amendments in the form of requests. The Senate's action, however, may be introduced into arguments about the meaning of the expression "laws imposing taxation" in section 55 of the Constitution, which is justiciable, and which would necessarily influence the interpretation of the same expression in section 53, and thereby influence the interpretation of section 53 as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I therefore suggest that, if the Senate decides to proceed by way of requests, this action is accompanied by a declaratory resolution, similar to those passed in relation to sales tax legislation in 1981 and the tax legislation arising from the budget last year, to the effect that the Senate's decision to proceed by way of requests does not indicate that the Senate considers that requests are necessary or that the Senate has arrived at any conclusive view as to the application of the constitutional provisions to the bill.</PARA>

In fact, honourable senators will notice that there is an amendment of the same nature, almost identical in wording, circulated in my name to the motion that has been outlined for the report of the committee to be adopted. Therefore, we will not be pushing the point; we will be happy to support the opposition in that particular amendment. There are, clearly, conflicting legal opinions with regard to the nature of requests and amendments in this particular case. This needs to be addressed. Basically, if the Senate passed the request without comment it would create a problem for the future. Whilst there is significant legal doubt, the Senate needs to be conditional about the need to make these changes as requests. We are not wishing to delay the bill because of its implications, but it is in everybody's interests that these issues are resolved.

<PARA>Despite what Senator Watson said on that point a moment ago, it seems to me that, even though this may have been considered in the past, what we now seek from that committee is some definitive opinion which takes into account the range of legal opinions, so that in future we do not get bogged down with debates of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Picking up the point Senator Watson has made, if that committee does seek a wide range of outside opinions, it should be within its competence to make a recommendation which should be adopted by the government. If there is some doubt about that, I think the way to proceed in future would be to test the distillation of that opinion which would come from the committee and see whether the matter is challenged. Ultimately, the validity of how we proceed is open to challenge in the High Court; that would be the final test. It does seem to me that Senator Watson has only gone part of the way. We are not creating a precedent by passing these amendments by way of request. However, the matter does need to be resolved in some more definitive manner. Therefore, I foreshadow that additional motion going as an addition to the motion that the report of the committee be adopted. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assuming that the proposed changes would impose more onerous obligations on at least some taxpayers&mdash;for example, if they changed the instalment arrangements so that some taxpayers would have the times for making their instalments brought forward&mdash;there is, in my view, a reasonable argument for saying that such a proposed change would `increase any . . . burden on the people'.</PARA>

With respect, this Department does not agree that a Bill which does not `impose taxation' is not capable of `increasing (a) proposed burden on the people'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The opposition will certainly not stand in the way of a reference to the committee, but the point I made before Senator Coulter came in was that the issue has already been examined in great detail by the committee and I think it would be unlikely that the members of that committee would add further substance to what they have already said. Despite that previous report&mdash;and it was a good report&mdash;the government has embarked upon a program of deliberately going down a confrontationist route with the Senate in terms of whether increasing the burden of taxation actually imposes taxation and these sorts of issues. So I think the preferable route is to throw it back to the government because at the end of the day it is an issue that has to be determined between the two houses of parliament.

There is a very important point here which perhaps is likely to be passed over between Senator Watson and the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Senator Cook). In proceeding with legislation, we should not be proceeding according to advice from the Attorney-General. The parliament itself is sovereign and we should be determining exactly what is the correct way to proceed. I anticipate, in relation to referring this matter back to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that, following whatever that opinion is, it would be appropriate for this chamber and, as Senator Harradine and Senator Watson have pointed out, the House of Representatives to look at that advice and to adopt that as the way of proceeding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee is currently considering a message received from the House of Representatives in relation to the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowance) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 which informs the Senate that the House of Representatives has not made the amendments requested by this house.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We requested the House of Representatives to make amendments to the bill to ensure that families who until now had been eligible for the with-child dependent spouse rebate are not prevented from receiving the home child-care allowance. A Senate inquiry has found, and the government has admitted during the Senate committee hearing on this bill, that certain families will be ineligible for the home child-care allowance due to differences in eligibility requirements and definitions under the relevant taxation and social security laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Families in at least four different types of circumstances will be ineligible for HCCA under the government's current bill. These four circumstances are: families in which the dependent parent or child is out of Australia for longer than 13 weeks; families in which the youngest dependent child is a full-time student aged between 18 and 25 years who earns less than $1,785 a year; families in which the dependent child is a prescribed student; and families who are disadvantaged by the more onerous income definitions in the Social Security Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These families will be significantly worse off than families who receive the home child-care allowance. Not only will they be ineligible for the HCCA but, in addition, the imminent abolition of those parts of the Income Tax Assessment Act that relate to the with-child dependent spouse rebate will mean that they will be ineligible for that rebate as well. They will only be able to claim a childless dependent spouse rebate, even though they will have dependent children. These families will be up to $372 a year worse off than families who will be receiving the HCCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put it bluntly but, I would argue, very accurately, if the government does not accede to the request we put forward, it is refusing to acknowledge or recognise the fact that these families even have children. Apparently the government's only argument in support of the exclusion of such families is that they are being sacrificed for the common good. This is an arrogant argument, if ever I have heard one. We heard some bizarre comments about this yesterday in question time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government claims that this bill will result in the vast majority of families being better off than they were under the old dependent spouse rebate. But this is no comfort to those families who will be up to $372 a year comparatively worse off under the new system. What have these families done wrong? When Mr Keating made his election promise, before the last election, these families believed that, as they were getting the dependent spouse rebate, they would be eligible for this HCCA that the Prime Minister was referring to. What sin have these families committed that warrants their being sacrificed for the common good? I suppose the answer must be that they are unlucky enough to be in the circumstances that subject them to different treatment under the social security system from that under the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone with any degree of compassion would want to know exactly how many families are in these circumstances. The coalition has on numerous occasions attempted to ascertain the number of disadvantaged families. Each time we do, the government claims that it is not possible to provide an estimate of the number of families. The government is able to give us estimates of just about everything else&mdash;not that the figures are always right&mdash;but it cannot give us an estimate of how many families are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley told us that it is `only a handful'. This is still an important issue for that handful of families. How does Senator Crowley know that it is only a handful? If she knows that, she should be able to give us an estimate of how many families are affected. However, it seems that there are no figures. I do not know whether Senator Crowley has asked for them. If the government does have an estimation, it is not prepared to tell the chamber how many families are affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe a significant number of families will be disadvantaged by this bill in its current form. One has only to look at the number of families who will be excluded as a result of the more onerous age restrictions that this government would apply to the HCCA. Previously, the with-child dependent spouse rebate was paid to families with dependent children in full-time education, aged 18 to 25, with separate net annual incomes of under $1,785 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's bill, the HCCA will cut out when a child turns 16 or when he or she finishes secondary school, whichever is the sooner. A significant proportion of the hundreds of thousands of young Australians aged up to 25 in tertiary education do not have personal incomes of over $1,785 a year. In relation to this issue, it has been pointed out to me that young people in rural areas cannot access part-time work in their holidays as easily as young people in the city can. Many of them are supported by families in which only one parent is working. Previously, the fact that such students were dependent on their families was recognised in the with-child dependent spouse rebate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, this is not the case with the home child-care allowance, regardless of parental income. This is but one of at least four circumstances in which families will be excluded from the HCCA. Not only do these exclusions appear niggardly; they also do not gel with the government's supposed policies in relation to providing income support for young people who live at home with their parents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1987 the government abolished unemployment benefits for 17- and 18-year-olds living at home, claiming they were still dependent on their parents. The Austudy parental income test and the Austudy scale of payments both recognise that tertiary students who live at home with their parents remain financially dependent on them. In fact, our previous Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, actually instructed young people to stay in education as long as possible due to their poor employment prospects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's refusal to recognise the fact that families provide for children who are aged over 16 years does not gel with the realities of contemporary Australian society. Young people are staying at home longer; they are staying at secondary school and in tertiary education longer; and their job prospects under this government and the recession we had to have have diminished significantly. All of these significant trends in our society mean that young people are remaining financially dependent on their parents for longer periods. However, in this bill, the government is giving the exact opposite message. It would appear to me to be hypocritical, coming from a government that, prior to the last election, chastised the coalition for its sole parent pension policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be pointed out that the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) recently had the gall to write to the shadow minister, Mr Ruddock, making totally outlandish claims about the unforeseen circumstances of the Senate's request for amendments. The coalition has bent over backwards urging the government to take action to rid this legislation of these needless anomalies. We have stated time and again that we will not jeopardise any of the benefits for families contained in this bill, despite the minister's ridiculous press releases saying that we are jeopardising the receipt of the HCCA by 840,000 families and despite the ridiculous comments that Senator Crowley made in question time yesterday indicating that Senator Minchin was telling people they would not get their HCCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The press releases the minister has put out have been blatantly wrong. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> record will show that the coalition has always recognised that the drafting of the necessary amendments is a complex matter. We have asked the government on three occasions to use its expertise to draft amendments that will ensure that families receiving the dependent spouse rebate are not prevented from accessing the home child-care allowance. When the coalition has offered such invitations, it is absolutely outrageous for the minister then to write to Mr Ruddock claiming that Senator Harradine's genuine attempt to rectify this unacceptable situation will have unforeseen circumstances. It must be pointed out that, in his letter, the minister made absolutely no attempt to suggest any possible changes to Senator Harradine's amendments that may have assisted in overcoming the unforeseen consequences he alleged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to expose the government's desperate tactics, which I alluded to earlier, in attempting to refute criticisms of its own behaviour in excluding these families from the home child-care allowance. I do not understand its behaviour in excluding these people. The government is resorting to the old gun-at-the head tactic, which is typical of the right wing of the Labor Party of New South Wales. Here is how it works. Firstly, government members make an outlandish claim that the opposition amendments will have the most deplorable unforeseen circumstances. Secondly, they tell the opposition that, if the amendments are supported, they will have no choice but to withdraw the legislation. Thirdly, they threaten to use their vast resources of public and taxpayers' money to tell everyone who otherwise may have benefited from the legislation that their benefits have been taken away by the opposition for the sake of assisting an undeserving minority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure the Democrats have been exposed to this tactic. In parliamentary parlance, I think it is quite rightly referred to as political blackmail: `If we do not get our way, we will tell everyone how terrible you are'. We have constantly said that we will not do anything to jeopardise the HCCA going ahead, but we will do everything within our power to ensure that those people who were eligible for the with-child dependent spouse rebate would be eligible for the HCCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the indications are that the government will resort to such underhanded tactics if the Senate seeks to ensure that such families are eligible for the home child-care allowance. The minister has said that we are jeopardising it. The only way it can be jeopardised is if this government takes the bill off and does not bring it back on. It cannot be jeopardised by the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his letter to Mr Ruddock, the minister alleged that Senator Harradine's request for amendments `would remove access to HCCA on a current income test basis'. In fact, this was the basis for the majority of the minister's alleged concerns about the Senate's request for amendments. This is not only a complete furphy, but the advice I have indicates that the HCCA income test in the current bill may not actually achieve the government's stated objective. There are a number of other issues but time does not allow me fully to go through them. I move:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome very much the coalition's decision to see sense and not to press for Senator Harradine's requests for amendments, but I have to make a couple of points to Senator Patterson in reply to her comments about the government not drafting the legislation for the coalition. Senator Patterson insists on missing the point. It is the point I have just made, and I will make it again. The government does not support, and has not supported, the intent of those amendments. That is what the House of Representatives has also confirmed and that is why we have consistently refused to vote for them and why we consistently refuse to be bothered with drafting amendments. What on earth would be the reason for the government drafting amendments for changes to its legislation that it does not support? That is why we are not interested in wasting resources on having them redrafted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Patterson made the point that there is an analogy with the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1993. In that example the big difference is that the government was ultimately prepared to give effect to the Senate's wishes and was therefore concerned to ensure that the legislation was drafted in the best way. The government is not interested in the proposed amendments to this HCCA legislation, for the reasons that I have already stated on a number of occasions. Unlike the Training Guarantee (Administration) Bill amendments, these represent fundamental changes to the bill which would substantially change the entitlement criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not persuaded. It does not in any way move away from its original bill as proposed. So it is not at all interested in drafting amendments to points that it disagrees with, and which indeed run against its own intention in the legislation.

I could go back through <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but do not believe I said that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley has said that she is not at all interested in drafting amendments to deal with the issues that Senator Harradine, the Greens and I have been raising. I would interpret that to mean she is not at all interested in families with dependent children who are outside Australia for longer than 13 weeks. I refer to those people who go and serve in developing countries on behalf of organisations such as World Vision and the missionary organisation Interserve&mdash;all those organisations whose members have contacted me on other issues, claiming that they are paying tax in Australia and are not eligible for benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the example of the Medicare levy and young academics who are travelling overseas, paying their taxes in Australia and struggling to pay for a rented home overseas while developing their skills for the benefit of Australia. Senator Crowley is saying, `We don't care about those people'. She is not at all interested in them or in the families in which the youngest dependent child is a full-time student aged between 18 and 25 and earning less than $1,785 a year. She is especially not interested in country kids who cannot get part-time jobs. She is saying that the government is not interested in families in which the dependent child is a prescribed student or in those families which are treated differently in this system because they are now under social security legislation rather than under the taxation act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All those people sat in front of their television sets waiting to hear the promises that Mr Keating gave them before the election&mdash;many of which have since been broken. For those people this is one promise that has been broken. They thought they were going to get a home child-care allowance. As Senator Harradine has said, the government has not explained to us why young academic families and families working overseas on aid programs are excluded. It is beyond my comprehension. To some people $270 to $300-odd may seem a small amount, but to those families which are struggling to achieve an improvement in their own knowledge or assist other people in other countries, it is a major amount. I do not understand it, and I do not believe that Senator Crowley has done anything to make us understand it. That is why we are giving the government every opportunity to explain it. Yet Senator Crowley says, `Why would we draft such amendments?'. Hopefully the minister will see the light, as she did in the other legislation where amendments were drafted, and say, `Yes, we will address this issue and we will extend what would have been available under the dependent spouse rebate to those families which are now excluded under the Social Security Act'. </PARA>

I would like the minister to advise me on this issue.

I ask the minister about the effect of importing the social security income test regarding what was formerly a taxation transfer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a definition of `income' in the social security legislation. `Income' in relation to a person means `a periodic payment by way of gift or allowance, or a periodic benefit by way of gift or allowance'.

Those are the exclusions in the income test definition under the social security legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The income test does not exclude gifts from a husband to a wife, or from a father or mother-in-law, for example.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just been given the job of addressing this bill because Senator Alston is overseas. I will briefly address the points in the bill that the committee considered. The Australian Chamber of Shipping, representing the principal foreign shipowners, submitted that it was totally unfair that they were subject to regulations, like having to have their ships impounded while they were in Australian ports, while the Australian vessels, mainly represented by the Australian National Maritime Association, were able to keep operating within the exclusion zone without detention.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> We took notice of what the Australian Chamber of Shipping had to say but we thought that where foreign vessels are suspected of polluting the sea in Australian waters, once they have put up their bond, they are free to sail. The committee questioned the government and received no undertaking that, no way in the world, would a ship be held up.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had fears that, if more than one ship was involved and the Australian Maritime Safety Authority was trying to work out which ship it was, the ships could be held up.

We would like to see it in practice to see whether it prevents foreign vessels from being treated unfairly in Australia. Those were our concerns, and I think they have been overcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address the Health Legislation (Powers of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1993. This bill has had a long gestation period. It is founded on the back of a report of the Auditor-General of December 1992 and an accompanying consultant's report of June 1992. Before that, there were the Joint Committee of Public Accounts hearings on fraud and overservicing. These occurred in the early to middle 1980s. Since that time, there has been very little improvement in combating fraud and overservicing. The bill has now been in the Senate since 16 December last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say at the outset that the coalition strongly supports the need to address fraud and overservicing. Last year the coalition supported the government's legislation on overservicing. It is clear from the work of the Auditor-General and the Bates report that serious inadequacies exist in current arrangements for tackling fraud. For instance, the Auditor-General found that there was a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action taken against unethical practitioners and that there has been little improvement since the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bates report found that the responsibility for detecting and prosecuting fraud has never been successfully integrated into the commission's operation. It also found that existing legislation does not support any positive approach to fraud control. There can, therefore, be no doubt that fraud is a problem and that a legislative response from the government is necessary. There is considerable doubt, however, as to how much will be saved by the measures outlined by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the last election, Labor claimed that its new spending promises on health could essentially be met by savings flowing from a reduction in fraud and overservicing.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This suggested savings of over $400 million over four years. In the first two years, savings of around $160 million were implied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition immediately challenged this figure, and with some justification. By the time of the August budget last year the estimated savings for the first two years had been pared back to around $90 million. This is the amount also identified in the explanatory memorandum to the bill. It states that measures to reduce fraud and overservicing, that is, this bill and the Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Act 1994, will save $25 million in 1993-94 and $64.9 million in the following year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important that the government's figures are challenged, so that we get nearer the truth of the matter. As far as the government is concerned, the larger the estimated cost of fraud, the easier it is for it to take this figure and argue for quite significant legislative provisions which have serious implications in the areas of investigation and privacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw this approach previously when the government was seeking to introduce data-matching between Commonwealth agencies, and produced quite stunning savings which it alleged could be achieved. These figures were used as a justification for the further extension of the use of the tax file number, raising serious privacy concerns. As it turned out, the actual savings achieved by the government as a result of data-matching have been dramatically less than first expected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill as presented to the Senate raised a number of concerns for members of the coalition. First, it proposed that the Health Insurance Commission officers be authorised to investigate medifraud instead of the Australian Federal Police. Second, it granted the Health Insurance Commission significant new powers to carry out such investigations. Third, in granting these new powers, it appeared to take no account of the privacy of individual patient records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of these concerns the coalition had the bill referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The committee conducted a public hearing on 11 February 1994. It was revealed quite early at this hearing that the government, 48 hours earlier, had decided that a number of amendments were needed. They were not, however, drafted in time for the public hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point was made at the hearing&mdash;and it is one that I strongly endorse&mdash;that it was irresponsible of the government not to inform the committee of its intentions in this regard, so allowing a delay in the hearing until the amendments were ready. It meant that the committee, and even more importantly, perhaps, the witnesses appearing before it, did not have before them the amendments which had significant implications for the operation of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the committee report on the Crimes (Search Warrants and Powers of Arrest) Amendment Bill 1993, the committee had something to say on just this very issue. The report said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee wishes to note that consideration of this Bill has raised issues about the mechanics of the Committee system. Clearly adequate time must be provided for the Committee to examine a Bill and for the Government to reflect on and respond to opportunities to remedy defects which are identified. The Committee will be making a submission to the Procedure Committee on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA>This point is equally valid with respect to the bill before us now. If the committee system is to operate as effectively as possible the government must treat the committee system with greater respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to briefly highlight another procedural matter, and this time it is with regard to the role of the Privacy Commissioner. I wrote to the Privacy Commissioner on 12 January this year requesting his comments on this bill. He wrote back to me on 25 January saying that he had provided comments to the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services and to the Health Insurance Commission in the course of their development of the provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He further stated that it was not his practice to make his confidential comments to the government available to other members of parliament. I was very disappointed by this response. Senator Vanstone raised this response with the commissioner at the Senate committee hearing. The commissioner conceded that if the government had ignored the concerns he raised he was in a dilemma as to whom he could tell. I do not criticise the commissioner for this but I would, however, criticise the statute which sets out his various functions, with nearly all of them expressed in terms of advice to ministers or advice to the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone raised the question of whether it would be better for the Privacy Commissioner to report to the parliament. There is no doubt in my mind that if the government was truly concerned with protecting the privacy of individuals, the Privacy Commissioner would report directly to the parliament. While departmental officers can be made available to opposition spokesmen for briefing on legislation, surely, in this very important area of the rights to privacy of citizens, the Privacy Commissioner should be able to brief the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A wide cross-section of those with an interest in this bill presented evidence to the committee. As well as professional groups such as the AMA, the Australian Association of General Practitioners and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, representatives of the Australian Federal Police presented evidence, as did the Privacy Commissioner and the Vice-President of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. With one exception&mdash;a representative of the Health Issues Centre&mdash;every witness highlighted concerns with the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major issues were those which I identified earlier. Division 3 of the bill came in for particular attention. This division as presented extends enormous new powers to the Health Insurance Commission. It allows authorised officers of the HIC to enter the premises of a doctor or pharmacist, search the premises, take photographs and take extracts or copies of books or documents. To all intents and purposes, as the Privacy Commissioner pointed out, these are search and seizure powers without a warrant. No regard is paid to the confidentiality of individual patient records. As well, under the bill as presented, the HIC would need no justification for entering the premises&mdash;an extraordinary situation, given the history of parliamentary and community concern on this issue. Not surprisingly, these provisions came in for widespread criticism at the committee's public hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the departmental representative indicated at the hearing that amendments were being drafted. In particular, he indicated that amendments to sections 8N and 8S, the two sections of most concern, would be forthcoming. On 21 February the minister provided to the committee a copy of the proposed amendments. The witnesses provided further comments to the committee in writing on the amendments. The amendments address to some extent concerns with the bill. They make clear that the confidentiality of patient records is not to be breached under the provisions of 8N and 8S. This was welcomed by the Privacy Commissioner; it is also welcomed by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments also require that the HIC officers may not enter premises for the purposes of compliance unless there are reasonable grounds for believing that an offence is being, or has been, committed. This is an improvement but it is still not entirely adequate, as I will explain later. The amendments to section 8T restrict to some extent the powers which may be exercised by officers of the HIC in searches allowed under division 3. Despite these improvements, the coalition, along with the Privacy Commissioner and many of the professional groups, still believed that more needed to be done in some areas. These areas were highlighted in the dissenting report of the coalition members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principal issues were as follows. Firstly, section 8S should reflect the administrative reality of officers of the HIC obtaining access to desired information by agreement with the occupier of the premise. Secondly, entry to premises should be on the basis of fraud which is suspected of being committed not which has been committed. Thirdly, a warrant provided under section 8W should specify whether or not it is to cover access to clinical records. Fourthly, the HIC should include in its annual report information on activities conducted under the powers introduced by this bill. Fifthly, consideration should be given to whether division 3 of the bill was justifiable at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister responded to the concerns raised in the dissenting report on 18 March 1994. He has accepted many of the suggestions, and I welcome this. However, two issues remain outstanding. The first is the inclusion of the words `has been or' in section 8S. Proposed section 8S as amended states that if an authorised officer has reasonable grounds for believing that a relevant offence has been or is being committed, he or she may enter the premises and exercise certain powers. The coalition believes that if section 8S is to stand, the words `has been or' should be removed. If HIC officers are able to enter premises without a search warrant, to leave the words `has been or' in the section is to make it too wide. It should be noted that the police are able to enter premises without a warrant only where they believe an offence is being committed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that if the HIC has been unable to obtain access to desired information by way of agreement with the occupier of the premises, then a warrant should be obtained to conduct a search. This would still preserve the powers available to HIC officers under section 8T. There is ample precedent in other Commonwealth legislation for this sort of arrangement, and I will outline some examples in the committee stage of the bill, where I will be moving amendments requiring a warrant for the powers under division 3 to be exercised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition believes that the provisions of this bill are serious ones. We recognise and support the need to address fraud in Medicare. We recognise and support the need for a legislative response. There can be no doubt that present arrangements for the investigation of medifraud are inadequate. But there can also be no doubt that this bill raises fundamental questions in regard to civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In protecting the interests of the taxpayer we must not violate the rights of patients, health care professionals and health care organisations. That is why the coalition has approached this bill in a very rigorous manner. We have had the bill referred to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. We have consulted widely. We have pressed the government to address shortcomings identified in the original bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where the government has not been prepared to meet us on outstanding issues we will move our own amendments. Apart from the amendments already flagged, I will be moving an amendment to include a sunset provision in the bill. Given the nature of this bill, and the largely unchartered territory that the HIC will find itself in, we in the coalition believe that it is reasonable that a sunset provision be included in the bill. No reasonable person or government could oppose such a suggestion. It will allow the parliament to evaluate, after a reasonable period, the effectiveness of the legislation, and the effectiveness of the HIC in administering it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I believe that the coalition has approached this bill in a spirit of cooperation, as has the government. Nonetheless, we still have outstanding concerns, and we will be pressing hard to address them in the committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Health Legislation (Power of Investigation) Amendment Bill 1993 represents the second stage of the government's attempt to tackle fraud and overservicing within Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. This bill will complement last year's Health Legislation (Professional Services Review) Amendment Bill, which established a system of peer review to address problems of overservicing. Basically, this bill  before us today picks up where the other bill left off and gives the Health Insurance Commission increased powers to investigate fraud against Medicare.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has been forced to take action in this area because it could no longer ignore the mounting evidence that medifraud and overservicing was costing Australian taxpayers a great deal of money. In 1992 the government received two reports dealing with fraud and overservicing within Medicare and the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. One was from the Commonwealth Auditor-General, the other from Mr Harvey Bates on behalf of the Health Insurance Commission. The Auditor-General found there was a lack of prosecutions and disciplinary action against unethical practitioners and that the Health Insurance Commission's performance in this area had shown virtually no improvement since the early 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Significantly, the Auditor-General also said the commission's legislative powers were deficient and recommended changing the legislation in order to get tough on fraud and overservicing. He expressed concern about the length of time it was taking for the Australian Federal Police and the Director of Public Prosecutions to complete cases referred to them by the HIC and recommended giving the commission the power to deal directly with the DPP instead of having to channel everything through the Federal Police. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Harvey Bates also found that existing legislation did not provide a satisfactory base to support any investigation into significant fraud. Among other things he suggested major legislative change which included giving the HIC adequate audit and entry powers. In response to these two reports the Health Insurance Commission set up a special legal unit to develop the legislative framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legal unit was particularly anxious to address criticisms of the commission's almost total lack of statutory audit verification powers and it proposed audit powers along the lines of the Australian Taxation Office's desktop audits. The commission was aware that clinical records might be needed to be examined as part of the audit process and, after consultation with the Privacy Commissioner, it set out a protocol to be adopted in all cases where it was necessary to view those clinical records. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before these proposals could get off the ground, Senator Richardson decided to instruct the commission to discontinue its consultations with community groups and effectively excluded the commission from discussions on fraud and overservicing held between himself, the department and the AMA. Senator Richardson effectively secured the cooperation of the AMA for the first time on these matters, and congratulations are due to the AMA for recognising the need to cooperate and to get involved as the need to tackle this problem was becoming very evident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The estimates of the extent of this problem vary enormously. In early 1980, based on computer profiles and bulk-billing practices, the Department of Health estimated the extent of fraud and overservicing to be at least 7 per cent of the total medical benefits expenditure by the Commonwealth and health funds. In 1982, the cost of fraud and overservicing was conservatively put at $100 million a year. If the same estimate were applied to today's budget, we would have a figure somewhere around $400 million a year. In the US, the General Accounting Office, the financial investigative arm of Congress, estimates that about 10 per cent of the US health care expenditure is wasted on fraud. If that were applied here we would end up with a figure of some $600 million. Harvey Bates put the figure at around $400 million. The fact is that we do not have a clue. We do not have all the evidence and information that we need&mdash;because we have not been tackling the problem&mdash;to put an actual figure on the size of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I guess it is a bit like tax avoidance: people say that we cannot do anything about tax avoidance because we really cannot estimate the size of the problem; we just do not know what is going on. Somehow that is seen as constituting a reason for not doing anything. We have been facing the same problem with medifraud. Some doctors argue very strongly that the estimates of the extent of fraud are vastly over-exaggerated. We do not know the details to be able to arrive at a figure. We clearly do not have a system which is able to pick up fraud. Certainly we do not have a system at the moment that is able to prosecute it. But it does not mean that we stand back and let it continue just because it cannot be quantified. We know the system is not working properly; we know there are serious deficiencies in the Health Insurance Commission's powers to investigate; we know we have a poor record in investigating and prosecuting medical practitioners for fraud; but we do know that when we do prosecute for fraud we recover substantial sums of money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate the government for finally getting serious and agreeing to do something about it. This bill, which moves to strengthen the powers of the Health Insurance Commission, signals that the government is finally getting serious about fraud and overservicing. In effect, this bill removes the Australian Federal Police from the investigation and prosecution process and gives those powers to the Health Insurance Commission. I would describe it as a reasonable set of powers to obtain relevant evidence. Contrary to the assertions made by the Medical Practice Defence Committee and a few others, I do not believe that the Health Insurance Commission sought these powers. Indeed, its preferred option was a system something like the desktop audit process that the Taxation Office has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new powers given to the commission include the power to require a person to provide information and produce documents; the power to inspect premises and equipment used in the provision of services that attract Medicare benefits; and, subject to a warrant being granted by a magistrate, the power to actually search and perhaps seize documents. We do not accept these powers lightly or agree that they should be handed over lightly. We have gone through quite an extensive committee process and asked quite a number of questions about how these powers are going to be used. I believe we have come up with a reasonable compromise. If we add in the government's amendments, we are almost there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that, contrary to some assertions, there are other bureaucracies that have similar powers of search and seizure. In particular, I emphasise customs, parks and wildlife and certain child protection officers who also have similar types of powers to move in, search and seize. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the examination of the bill by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, a number of concerns were raised about key provisions in the legislation. I believe the minister has responsibly dealt with most of those, and the AMA is now largely satisfied with the bill. It has a couple of notable reservations which I will raise during the committee stage. Indeed, the Democrats will move amendments to the legislation by the time we reach the committee stage at some hour later today. We are in the process of having the amendments drawn up after our final consultations late last night. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, other more extreme objections to this legislation that have been raised reflect political and professional agendas. The minister has quite rightly rejected a number of these claims. We have also rejected them because what we have now and will have in the final product to come out of the committee stage will be in the best interests of the Australian taxpayer and the Australian public health system. In conclusion, I stress that the Australian Democrats will support this legislation and will move amendments during the committee stage. We hope to be able to distribute those amendments shortly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleague Senator Newman. I wish to speak on three matters: privacy, sledgehammers and fraud. The privacy aspects have been of considerable concern, and evidence on privacy has been given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs&mdash;in particular by Mr Terry O'Gorman, the Vice-President of the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. The point was made there should be no circumstances where an individual patient should be denied the knowledge that access has been provided to clinical details relating to that person. It would be absolutely monstrous if that were to occur. I am sure the minister would not like details of any blood tests done on him in relation to HIV or a sexually transmitted disease to become the concern of public servants poring over the details. Members of the public would not want public servants going through details of their medical histories. Do not tell me that this information can be kept private once it gets into the department; it is not possible for that to occur. It would appear that under the provisions, not only would the patient not be aware that this was occurring, but those details would also be available to the bureaucracy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the matter of sledgehammers: this bill is using sledgehammers to crack walnuts. The department is being given unprecedented police powers to go in and search documents that will be available to it under this legislation. The department itself has indicated that the overwhelming bulk of investigations are in relation to very small amounts. The figures that were plucked out of the air last year were in relation to an extrapolation of what occurs in the United States, where 10 per cent of a person's bill may go in fraud or over-servicing&mdash;or eight per cent, or seven per cent and various billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the public is aware that every individual medical practitioner in Australia has a file on him or her over in Medicare headquarters which details the number of patients that he or she sees, the number of pathology tests that are ordered, the number of X-rays that are ordered and the name of the radiologist who provides those X-rays and the pathologists who do those blood tests. That information is available in detail. The computerisation of records and the pay-out under Medicare is extraordinarily well documented. It is the right of any doctor to request a print-out every six months of his or her pattern of practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of times I have been over at Medicare headquarters and looked at the details provided. It is Big Brother of the future that is here in the present. The department is well aware of the networking that is available, and it is possible for it to survey from time to time and see who should be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of fraud, as Senator Lees said, is entirely hypothetical. If we look at the medical practice as a whole, there are only two avenues where there are vast sums involved: radiology and pathology. Individual medical practitioners work on a fee-for-service basis&mdash;they see a patient, get paid a fee, and the patient gets a refund from Medicare, so that is fairly easy to control. If the department is really serious, it should be looking at the two major avenues of fraud, and in particular pathology, because it is the only one in which vast sums are going back and forth. There has been an increase in pathology services of about 30 per cent over the last five years. The department has the cooperation of the Australian Society of Pathologists in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point that I want to raise is fraud itself and the powers given to the department in relation to the investigation. In his letter in the report, Mr O'Gorman said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, I repeat my observation that the increased lease powers, the subject of the bill, will be used widely and frequently across the range of general practitioner surgeries, specialist rooms, pathology providers and even pharmacists.</PARA>
<PARA>So we have this spectre of Big Brother across the whole procedure. I will look with interest over the next year or two, and hopefully beyond that, to see just how much money is involved in the extraordinary powers that we are now giving to the bureaucracy in terms of investigation, because I believe it will be peanuts. Given the already large facilities that are available to the department in the investigation of fraud at present, I completely support my colleague in the introduction of a sunset clause. Otherwise, we will have yet another bureaucracy set up to look at the provision of medical services. It will get lost in the bureaucracy, there will be more bureaucrats and more control when, ultimately&mdash;and I am quite confident of this&mdash;it will be found that what we are erecting here is a giant machine to crack a few nuts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier on in the consideration of Transport and Communications Amendment Bill (No. 3) the Australian Democrats were seeking to amend the legislation because of our concern over ballast water. Although it is not certain, it seems reasonably clear that there have been at least two quite serious episodes of contamination of the sea around Australia as a consequence of the discharge of ballast water which had been taken on in the northern hemisphere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One episode involved infestation with the Undaria pinnatifida seaweed and the other the northern Pacific Asterias amurensis starfish. Whilst it is not absolutely certain this infestation occurred because of ballast water&mdash;it may have occurred because of the carriage of these organisms on the outside of hulls&mdash;there seems to be very good reason to urge that ballast water be cleaned, to be sterile in a biological sense, if possible, to protect Australia through that mechanism from the importation of organisms which could seriously devastate the marine environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we came to look at doing this by way of the sorts of amendments we might propose, it became somewhat difficult because some of the factors involved are uncertain. Therefore we have chosen the alternative method of appending to the motion that the report of the committee be adopted a set of conditions which in fact are exactly the protocol which is already being followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is our understanding that this amendment merely sets out those things which are already being done. But it further urges the government to deal with this matter as a very serious matter; to move forward as quickly as possible with the identification of the causes of this pollution of our environment with northern hemisphere species&mdash;or, indeed, with species which could be transmitted from one part of Australia to another in the form of the various algal blooms which can cause problems with the fishing industry and make fish quite toxic. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our amendment simply gives effect to what we understand is already the practice in Australia. In the last section we urge the government to give the highest priority to the development of on-board processing of ballast water. That follows an attempt to look at how ships might take on board pre-sterilised ballast water from onshore. That seems to be a difficult process, given the fact that many ships come to Australia in ballast, and then go out with material on board, so that there is not, as it were, a reciprocal movement of ballast water around the world. The final section of this amendment also requests:</PARA>

There was an original set of Democrat amendments which we considered; the Democrats revised it on 15 March but did not send it to us; they revised the amendment again today and did not send it to us. We could hardly have addressed it at this stage. From quickly running through the amendment, I consider it to be an inner glow amendment that does not really mean much.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is generally us on this side. But okay, in this case, as Senator West has pointed out, it is the government. The amendment calls for `appropriate legislative initiatives and consultations with the states'. How do we define `appropriate' when dealing with the states? I ask how, why, and when? Probably `when' will be answered over the page. Paragraph (a) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the states accept their responsibility for the uptake and discharge of ballast water by coastal shipping;</PARA>
<PARA>Is it really the domain of the states to do that, and not the Maritime Safety Authority? Paragraph (b) states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Port Authorities assume responsibility for alerting coastal shipping to factors covered under paragraph (b);</PARA>
<PARA>Once again, are the port authorities the right sort of authority to do that sort of work? I have my doubts about that&mdash;great doubts. The amendment continues with similar things, such as:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the highest priority is given to the development of on board processing of ballast water;</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Coulter wants to go along with this idea of onshore treatment of ballast water, I would agree that we have a future there&mdash;discharging ballast water that comes from another part of the world, treating it and then using it as ballast for another ship&mdash;but there would need to be a very quick technological development to be able to process water on board a ship. I do not see it happening in the next 10 years or so. As for this being laid on the table by February 1995, again, that is like talking about the government's best endeavour and deciding who will be the judge of that. Senator West will be the judge, no doubt. While we were not alerted to these amendments, the concerns I have expressed are not very strong ones and the coalition has no intention of opposing them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, one of the concerns the government had with this amendment is that it is not treated at the moment as a transport matter within the Department of Transport. In fact, it is coincidental that I, as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, have been delegated responsibilities for some matters to do with quarantine and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, including this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, however, I appreciate Senator Coulter's concerns about this matter. It was certainly a new issue to me when I was briefed on and, in fact, launched a discussion paper on the matter late last year. That was at the same time that the problems in Tasmania with the northern starfish, as Senator Coulter referred to, became evident. We believe that the starfish was brought into Tasmanian waters by an unknown vessel. It would be wrong to say it was a Japanese vessel even though the starfish come from Japanese waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very critical issue because, unfortunately, of all the various plants and organisms that have been transferred from one part of the world to another&mdash;whether in the marine environment or on land&mdash;we have not been successful in eradicating one in this country. We have been successful in reducing and containing their numbers but we have not been able to eliminate one species of plant or animal totally. I think I referred to this starfish at the time as a marine rabbit. That is exactly what it is. We all know the problems we have had with rabbits in this country. This starfish has spread up the coast of Tasmania and quite possibly into Victorian waters. We believe that it will be limited by the warmer waters. The starfish are unlikely to spread further than Adelaide or the New South Wales border because the waters there are warmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The starfish represents a significant problem, not just to commercial fisheries&mdash;whether fish farms or whatever the type of operation&mdash;but also to the marine environment itself. It is a particularly avaricious eater of everything in its path. I can see that Senator Kemp wants me to wind my speech up. It is an interesting switch, is it not, Senator Kemp? I am not speaking for the sake of speaking. It is an issue with which I have some familiarity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to touch on just two more points. Senator Panizza raised the issue of whether ports, states or the Commonwealth should have jurisdiction in this area. I only wish the Commonwealth did have sole jurisdiction but, unfortunately, the Fraser government, in its dying days, gave jurisdiction of the waters of Australia to the three-mile limit back to the states without finalising details of these sorts of issues. Today, we are still trying to finalise the management of fisheries in the three-mile limit. It is unfortunate that these sorts of matters were not resolved in terms of the jurisdictional issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the other points that Senator Coulter and Senator Panizza have touched on, it would certainly be desirable to develop effective mechanisms for processing the ballast water on board the vessels. There are a significant range of problems&mdash;Senator Coulter has touched on some of them&mdash;in processing this water in port. Because of time, I will not go into that today.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very critical issue; it is a major environmental issue. It will only grow as a problem because of the increasing world trade. I personally treat it as a significant problem. I have responsibility in the area, and I see it as particularly urgent&mdash;not just because I have responsibility in the area, but because I have seen first-hand the devastating effects of this starfish in Tasmania.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about a matter which is of personal concern to not only many members of the Jewish community but also to the wider community. Last Sunday week I attended a video launch at the Beth Weizmann Community Centre in Melbourne. The video had two purposes: first, to escalate a worldwide search for the one person who could save one man's life; and, second, to educate people on the need to join the established data bank of potential bone marrow donors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The occasion was sponsored by the Keren Hayeled Committee, an Australian-Jewish volunteer group which assists those who are facing life threatening illnesses and assists where funding is lacking. The video was very well and movingly produced by Harry Mehlman, of Hi-Key Productions. The video has been translated into French and Hebrew and the committee would like to have it translated into other languages. The well-known Melbourne radio personality Neil Mitchell, who has taken a particular interest in the issue of bone marrow transplants, hosted the occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Each year some 400 young Australians are diagnosed as suffering from a kind of leukaemia that will respond only to a bone marrow transplant. The video told the story of one of these people. It was about a friend of my family, Yehuda Kaplan, who is 32 years old and a father of a 19-month-old daughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yehuda is a most likeable person. Working as a journalist at the Special Broadcasting Service on the Hebrew program, he was exceedingly popular among his colleagues. He is an ambitious, intelligent, hardworking and courageous young man&mdash;by any measure a man who is determined to make a success of his life. He has everything to live for&mdash;above all, a devoted wife and daughter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Sunday briefing to launch the video Mr Albert Haddad, a scientist from the Red Cross tissue typing laboratory, and Dr Max Wolf, set out clearly the nature of the challenge facing Yehuda. A couple of years ago, Yehuda Kaplan was diagnosed as having contracted a rare and dangerous form of lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system. After having intensive chemotherapy and other treatment, including a transplant of his own bone marrow, doctors decided that an unrelated bone marrow transplant was the best hope for Yehuda Kaplan. Matched bone marrow transplants in such cases provide a strong chance of combating the disease. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In effect, only people with an identical immune system genetic structure to the patient can be considered as possible donors. Yehuda Kaplan is Jewish. Therefore, the chance of finding a fully matched bone marrow donor is likely to be highest within a subgroup of the Jewish community. The most suitable donor for such a transplant is a fully matched brother, sister or other close relative, but only one in three patients are lucky enough to have such a donor. Where there is no compatible family member the search commences to find someone whose immune system can be perfectly matched with the recipient. Yehuda Kaplan must find a perfectly compatible unrelated donor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allen Feiglin, the coordinator for the committee, has called on the Jewish community to volunteer to register with the Australian bone marrow donor registry. There are currently some 57,000 people on the register and about one million worldwide. Allen Feiglin pointed out that the chances of finding an unrelated matched donor in an ideal circumstance, that is, within Yehuda Kaplan's subgroup of mixed Tunisian Sefardi and Polish Ashkenaz ancestry, is about one in 10,000, possibly less.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Jewish community has been called on to assist in this search for a donor. At present there are only about 1,000 people on the register who are Jewish. The search is continuing not only in Australia but worldwide. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The video calls on Jewish communities around the world to register with the international bone marrow donor registry. There are a number of issues raised by this video and the case of Yehuda. First, there is the need to greatly expand the bone marrow register, especially in a multicultural society such as Australia. Comparatively few donors are from ethnic communities. This problem must be addressed if the bone marrow registry is to provide an adequate service to the whole Australian community. I congratulate the leadership role that the Keren Hayeled Committee is taking in encouraging members of the Jewish community to take the simple blood test to be registered. This example could be followed by other ethnic communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Second, as is so often the case in medical cases, there is a constant need for additional funds. The federal government is partially funding the testing of donors until the registry reaches an arbitrarily determined quota of 100,000. The process of bone marrow transplantation is becoming more widely used for treating many other forms of cancer, including breast cancer. With this increase in need far beyond the patient numbers of leukaemia and lymphoma, the database of only 100,000 will be most inadequate in providing a good cross section of genetic types. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian bone marrow registry is a national body with its hub in Sydney at the blood bank. The funding for this work is a joint federal-state arrangement which is to be renewed for the next three years from June 1994. A funding review has just taken place to ascertain the real costs of running the registry. I hope that the government will be able to give a high priority to providing funds to support the important work of the registry. I note that Senator Herron, who is in the chamber, has taken a particular interest in these matters and I know that the remarks I am making would have his strong support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, and most vitally, there is the need to assist patients in every way possible. As the Bone Marrow Donor Institute has indicated, only approximately 25 per cent of those needing a transplant will find an Australian donor; the remainder have no option but to search for an overseas donor. Searches of overseas registers can cost an average of $5,000 to $6,000. The costs leading to a bone marrow transplant are very substantial. An international search for a compatible donor now requires the patient to fund any cost beyond the first $5,000. Commencing a few months ago, the initial $5,000 is now provided by the Australian Bone Marrow Donor Registry. Prior to this, the patient had to find all the funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Approximately 90 overseas searches are commenced each year. Inevitably, this will mean the need to raise money by public appeal. In the case of Yehuda Kaplan, the Keren Hayeled committee has paid out $10,000 to date, with a further $5,000 called for this week. Medicare and private insurance do not cover the costs and there are loopholes which leave the patients to fend for themselves. My brother Dr David Kemp, the honourable member for Goldstein, has also taken an interest in the case of Yehuda Kaplan and has written to the health minister, Senator Richardson, about the high costs of searching overseas for compatible donors. Senator Richardson has indicated, among other things, that act of grace payments may be provided in certain circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the problem is that if the search is not successful, or the patient dies prior to transplant, no refund is made for the cost of the search. Families can be left with huge debts  and a serious financial problem&mdash;apart from their having to cope with the agonising loss of one of their loved ones. Families should not be prevented from searching overseas because they cannot afford the costs involved. The Bone Marrow Donor Institute argues that the federal government should fund all overseas searches to a cut-off point of at least $6,000 per patient, even if the searches do not lead to a transplant. I strongly support this proposal. I understand my colleague Senator Herron has written that he also supports this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have brought this matter to the attention of the Senate today because, as a friend of Yehuda Kaplan, I am anxious that the work of the doctors involved with this case will meet with success. The case of Yehuda Kaplan raises the wider issue of how we can upgrade the activities of the bone marrow registry to ensure that other patients in the future have an increased chance of a successful bone marrow transplant. I am sure all senators will join with me in praying that Yehuda Kaplan will be restored to full health and live a long life. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not about whoever replaces me. I am utterly confident, on the word of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer, that that plan will be put in place. While opposition senators can scoff now, I have to tell them that on the night of 10 May Senator Newman will look pretty silly for asking this question.

Has the minister seen the media release of 22 March put out by the shadow minister, Mr John Anderson, alleging that there is no point in applying for rural adjustment scheme support?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That particularly stupid press statement issued by Mr Anderson contains accurate figures. It is not like him to put out silly press statements, but this one is. He quoted the success rate of farmers applying for assistance under the very heavily funded rural adjustment scheme and then went on to say that this was justification for it not being worthwhile for farmers to apply for the scheme. His figures are correct. Of the over 18,000 applications received by RAS authorities, 6,314 were rejected, as Mr Anderson's press statements correctly states; that is, two out of every three people who applied for assistance under RAS got it. Those 20,000 farmers&mdash;and that is about the number that is receiving assistance under RAS&mdash;would be highly surprised to hear their coalition National Party representative in this parliament, who purportedly represents them in this important area, say that it is not worth applying, when two out of every three of the applicants, on his own figures, were successful.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 31 December 1993, over 20,000 farmers were in receipt of support under this important scheme, and 9,971 farmers were still receiving assistance under the schemes that applied before the current scheme commenced in January 1993. This is in addition to the 11,077 successful applicants in 1993. Like any other scheme that hands out large amounts of government money for assistance, there are eligibility criteria attached to this money&mdash;and so there should be. If there were not, we would be in here getting our heads kicked in because we were not providing sufficient accountability to the parliament on how this money was expended.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">RAS is targeted at supporting those farmers who have a long-term future in farming and the potential to make an economic contribution to the farming sector, but who are going through periods of difficulty; in other words, they have got some prospect of becoming viable. The two main reasons for rejecting applications are that the farmer concerned does not need the assistance, or that the farmer concerned is not likely to become viable. In that case, as I know honourable senators in this chamber with rural constituencies know, there is a provision under RAS for re-establishment grants of $45,000 to be paid in those circumstances as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Anderson states that people keep on saying that there is no point in applying for RAS if they get knocked back. That being the case&mdash;I would like to hear National Party senators support it&mdash;we could have saved ourselves $185 million of public monies last year by not funding RAS at all if it is not worth applying for. I think Mr Anderson should reconsider the silly statement that he has put out. He should accept the fact that we have to have eligibility criteria&mdash;which I might add are administered on the ground by the state government authorities that implement this system which we fund. Mr Anderson should withdraw that statement and support this scheme, which is highly valued by over 20,000 primary producers in Australia who are in receipt of assistance under it.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nonetheless, I think Senator Coulter's question about a national pollutant inventory needs an answer. The government is strongly committed to fulfilling its pre-election environmental promises. This includes developing an effective legislated national pollutant inventory with strong community right-to-know provisions. The active involvement of a wide range of interest groups is essential. The community has a right to information on the releases of chemicals and waste in the environment and there is currently no national database which collates this information. The NPI will fulfil this role.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My department has advised that the delay in the release of the inventory discussion paper and postponements of the workshops were necessary to accommodate strong community concerns and to involve the new minister. It is worth noting that I did not pretend to anyone, including the Senate, that I was a long-term environment minister. I happened to know why at the time, but I did not share that with everybody.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delay does not in any way reduce the strength of the government's commitment and should not be interpreted as such, nor is it an opportunity for a new minister to renege on government commitments. We have developed extensive consultative processes with key interest groups and other levels of government. These include the release of a discussion paper seeking community views, a series of one-day workshops in capital cities, an inventory task force and an inventory reference group comprising stakeholders. These processes will give the community an excellent opportunity for direct involvement in developing the inventory.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue which will be addressed quickly as a matter of very high priority by the new minister, given the need to meet the four-year timetable for developing the NPI which we announced in December 1992.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is not in the business of encouraging young people to leave home prematurely, nor is it in the business of approving income support without thorough consideration.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important issue of family involvement is also under consideration in this agreement. It is particularly important that we do not ask young people to return to homes where they will continue to be placed at risk. The agreement also asks that family mediation be considered as a very important aspect of helping young people in distress. Young people need to be provided with assistance and support to remain at home and in education. Quite clearly, it is a matter of judgment because often there is a fine balance between the rights of the young person and that young person's interests, and the rights of the family to know and have a responsibility for the care of their child.</PARA>

It is a very bizarre approach. I cannot possibly see what mileage Senator Minchin expects to get in asking that a benefit that will assist families not be available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until this point, child-care assistance was available to people at the lower and middle end of the economic scale of family income. The cash rebate recognises that lots of families do not have access to child care, either by choice or because the child care is not available to them through the formal child-care processes. The cash rebate will assist people with the cost of their child care in the informal child-care area. It will extend a benefit to families around this country, and Senator Minchin wants to support its repeal. It is a very bizarre approach.</PARA>

I have also been advised that in order for there to be no confusion on this issue the point must be made that the services that Senator Bourne is concerned about, open narrowcast services, are licensed under a class licensing system under the Broadcasting Services Act 1992.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unlike mainstream broadcasting services, open narrowcast services are not individually licensed. An operator of an open narrowcast service simply obtains a technology licence&mdash;for example, a Radiocommunications Act transmitter licence&mdash;from the Australian Broadcasting Authority or the Spectrum Management Agency. Provided the operator meets the class licence conditions laid down in the Broadcasting Services Act, there are no other restrictions. It is important to note that under this regime there is no suitability test for operators of these services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister advises me that the reason for this is that the regime reflects the niche broadcasting character of narrowcast services. The reception of these services is limited by being targeted to special interest groups or by providing programs of limited appeal, limited time period or geographical reach. The degree of regulation is therefore much less than that applying to mainstream broadcasters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to Senator Bourne's specific questions about Mr Ashton, the minister cannot comment on the cost of any litigation which persons involved in this matter may initiate.

There are no powers available to the minister under the Broadcasting Services Act to assist persons with claims against the operators of narrowcast services.</PARA>

Every one of them, in my judgment and Mr Bilney's judgment, satisfies the criterion of having no axe to grind in the sense of having had, on the record, statements of position published&mdash;argumentative position&mdash;of a kind that it might be reasonable to think that they would feel obliged to defend in the course of this particular inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>

The number of middle-class Asian households is forecast to rise by 50 per cent by the year 2000 to 51 million households, or approximately 200 million to 300 million people overall. Based on this growth, plus the convergence of media and telecommunications technologies, the discussion paper identifies the following opportunities for Australia's audiovisual industries in the Asian region: the development of multi-media products, that is, interactive programs for training, education and entertainment; producing TV programs and training videos in non-English languages directly for regional markets; the provision of film and TV production training to other countries in Asia, for example, Indonesia, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam; and the provision of other audiovisual services, including technical consultancy, management, financial and production guarantor services.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision of the Full Federal Court in CTC Resources No Liability v Federal Commissioner of Taxation supports the legislative framework behind the system of binding rulings on proposed transactions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court has said that the binding rulings system is constitutionally valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision endorses the legal right of taxpayers to seek binding private rulings on transactions which have yet to be entered into.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The real impact of the decision of the court was that an appeal against the disallowance of an objection to a private ruling was incompetent as the ruling related to an arrangement that had not been implemented before the expiry of the income year in which the arrangement was to have been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision does not amount to a denial of taxpayers' rights in the resolution of disputes. The Court held that, in this case, the taxpayer had no rights to review of the ruling because the proposed arrangements had not been implemented within the timeframe nominated by the taxpayer&mdash;that timeframe being a fundamental element of the ruling given to the taxpayer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government accepts the decision of the Federal Court in this case. At this stage the Government does not see any need to amend the law.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), to questions without notice asked by Senators Newman and Herron this day, relating to his pending resignation and the administration of the Health portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Health (Senator Richardson) spent considerable time earlier this year trudging around&mdash;and admirably so&mdash;the backblocks of the Northern Territory and northern Australia generally. There were headlines in newspapers all over Australia such as, `Senator vows to help blacks' health'; `Richardson targets Aboriginals' health'. The fine print stated that the political will had not existed to deal with the problems of Aboriginal health until now. He said he was `an accident of history'. He said, `I happened to be here at the right time'. This is the man who now thinks it is the right time to move on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If he thinks that fixing a tap in an Aboriginal community is the way to fix this appalling problem that has lasted for far too many years&mdash;11 of them under a Labor government&mdash;then he has no compassion whatsoever and it was a hollow exercise. Yet black Australians believed he was going to do something. The reports of his travels stated that the trip had been well received by Aboriginal groups who believed Senator Richardson had a genuine commitment to improve health conditions. People were interviewed on television and radio, saying, `This one will be different; he is different from all the others; he is committed'. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BE4">Senator NEWMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In for the long haul, and he is out within two months. It is not just Aboriginal people who are disappointed having regard to the promises and expectations that have been raised; there are the people referred to in the Burdekin report, the health care providers and their patients who were getting nowhere with Mr Howe. Senator Richardson came along a month ago to a conference in Sydney of the Australian Catholic Health Care Association and said, `I'm going to fix this. I'm going to get your money. Don't worry about what has been said before. Now that I'm looking after you, you're going to be all right'. He said this to women with breast cancer. Only this week, two days ago, he put out a press release from his private office stating that he was going to have a national symposium in mid-May. So much for his commitment!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He was making appointments this week for next week with health care providers. This is the man who says he knew back in January&mdash;back in January, when he was visiting Aboriginals in central Australia and northern Australia, and he knew he was not going to be around to implement these policies. He has also been talking about doubling the funding for medical research. There is a fat chance of that happening when he walks off and leaves midstream. What about those in private health insurance, and women worried about breast cancer, as I said? Five weeks before a crucial budget, he has bailed out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only this week he was making arrangements to serve on. What has happened? Only last week he gave details to the Senate of his April overseas ministerial trip. He gave us great detail. He told us where he was going, what he was going to do, that it was all to do with the pharmaceutical world. He was going to have a bit of private time on the way back and he would pay for that; that was separate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He has been going around the country saying things like, `Private medicine has not got much of a future if we do nothing', and, `There are too many people waiting too long in pain for vital operations'. He has been saying that it is going to come to a crunch point very soon for those low-income people who are in private health insurance. He said, `It just isn't far away'. People believed he listened, that he cared, that he understood and that he was prepared to put something in place. How wrong they were. Today, the Australian Private Hospitals Association has put out a press release calling on any new minister to get on with the job; that there is no time to lose. It said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Richardson was the first Labor health minister in 11 years to admit there was a problem.</PARA>
<PARA>That statement says something&mdash;the trouble is, he could not convince the rest of his party there was a problem and that it needed attention. The press release continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will never know whether Senator Richardson was actually capable of addressing the problems which confronted him.</PARA>
<PARA>It also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new minister simply can't afford the luxury of taking six months to settle into the portfolio. Much of the hard work in the reform process has already been done and we must continue to move forward. Taking no action is simply not an option.</PARA>
<PARA>These are serious matters. This minister is bailing out on the eve of the necessary implementation having to take place. He has had a year of talking. But he did say last December, `When the crunch comes, I can't and won't take on the Prime Minister'. The crunch has come and the job is not done. I am not convinced there is any justifiable reason for his going except he has not got the numbers; he cannot persuade his party; and he has not got the support of his Prime Minister (Mr Keating). </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some disagreements with Senator Richardson from time to time, but he is a politician who has a very distinguished record. For Senator Newman to refer to him in that way, before he has had the opportunity to state on the public record his reasons as to why he is resigning, is particularly ungracious and ill-mannered. We do not know at the moment why Senator Richardson is resigning. There is speculation that it is because of his health, and we do know that Senator Richardson has not been in the best of health over the past couple of months. That may be the reason why he is going to resign, but we will certainly find out, I hope, tonight. I do know that it is not because Senator Richardson has lost any battles with the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), because I cannot remember Senator Richardson being defeated on anything over the last 20 years, if we look at his record. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I listened to that diatribe before. No less a person than the Governor-General called Senator Richardson the minister for kneecaps. His reputation is as a kneecapper. What has he done as a minister? He has been a political hit man, that is what he has been. He has got the numbers, and Senator Sherry said that his reputation is that he has never lost a battle.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to refer to an answer that he gave previously. I accused him of being gutless during a question that I asked.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is criminal, because it affects every person in this country. I will pay Senator Richardson a tribute: he thought he could actually do something. He went around the country seeking advice from everybody, and then he did exactly what everybody thought he would do&mdash;he let the department run him. There are two types of ministers in governments: the ones who know how to go about it and how to control their departments, and the others who let their departments control them. Senator Richardson was the classic kneecapper, the classic political apparatchik. He did not have a clue what to do, and he let the department run him. Within a few months of becoming minister, he ran with the department's agenda. The department's agenda was more control and more bureaucracy. Its agenda was not to trust anybody, control the private hospitals, so that they in turn could control the doctors, and then it is taken off the political spectrum. It was a great political exercise that he was attempting, and then the facts came home to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know why he is going now. He has lost the confidence of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). The Prime Minister rejected the increase in the Medicare levy for higher income earners. The Prime Minister, peculiarly enough, was probably correct in rejecting some of those things, because, ultimately, what the minister did not realise was that those controls and those attempts to get the private hospitals to control health care have failed everywhere else in the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These attempts failed because they came between the ultimate determinants of health care: the individual patient and the individual treating medical practitioner. Any system that comes between the patient and the doctor is doomed to fail because the patient will trust the doctor more than he or she will trust the politician. The patient is absolutely correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister is now washing his hands of the whole deal; it has all become too much for him. He has seen the problems, he has collected them&mdash;I grant him that&mdash;and he has enunciated them. But, as I asked in my question to him, what is he going to say to all those people that he has been out there grandstanding to? What is he going to say to the Aboriginals that Senator Newman spoke of; to the women of Australia in relation to breast cancer research; to the medical research fraternity; and to the people of Australia?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to one question Senator Richardson said that he was going to spend the next 10 years improving the public and private health care system. Now he says, `Oh! I am going away. I need a rest. I am going to spend time away.'. If he had that in mind, why did he lie to the people of Australia when he made those statements earlier this year? As little as a week ago he said that he was not going to go around telling everybody what he was going to do. But it is on the parliamentary record that he said, `I will be around for the next two years. I will be around for the next number of years overseeing these changes that I am bringing in.' I hope Senator McKiernan is taking note of that so he can tell me why Senator Richardson made those statements. They were deliberately misleading.

While the commitment was given in person by Senator Richardson, it was given by a member of the executive government of this country. It is the executive government of this country that should be charged with upholding the commitments that Senator Richardson gave in January of this year. Not only would I expect that those honourable senators opposite will be applying pressure on the executive government and on the incoming minister for health to deliver on those commitments, but people on this side of this chamber and in the other place will be seeking from the new minister for health and the executive government the delivery of its promises. </PARA>

They were the characteristics of Senator Richardson's performance for a short period of time only, regrettably, in the transport and communications portfolio and, for a rather longer period of time, in the environment portfolio where he demonstrated not only a capacity to read the political currents that were running in the country at the time but also an enormous capacity to contribute substantively to resolving the great environmental issues of the time&mdash;not least in his establishment of permanent protection for the tropical rainforests of northern Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask for the ability to continue for the remaining minute and a half I have, to complete that theme, consistent with the terms of the debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, the debate has not ranged widely; it has confined itself to the issues in those two questions. For Senator Evans and Senator McKiernan to suggest that the debate has ranged widely and away from the questions which were asked is quite untrue. I moved that the answers which the minister gave on health be taken note of.

It might be a good idea for the Prime Minister to have the sort of experience I had of being chairman of the annual report award committee of the Australian Institute of Management for a few years so he can work out what one and one make, because there is no doubt he has absolutely no idea, as is evident from his investment in the first place, what sort of a financial mess this extraordinary group has been and is in.</PARA></TALK.START>

That might have been the basis upon which the Prime Minister invested the $430,000, which I understand he borrowed from someone to put into this venture. One director of Danpork Australia Pty Ltd said that this was a financially strong body with which his company was joining. He said it was a `financially strong meat wholesaler and pig producer'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I present the government's response to the report of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts on physical and sport education. I seek leave to incorporate the document in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and move a motion in relation to the report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The document read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 7 May 1992, the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts received the following reference:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Considering the importance of physical and sport education to the lifelong health and personal development of the individual, the Committee assess, investigate and report on:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) the present level and status of physical and sport skills and the involvement of Australian school children in physical and sport education;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) current training practices, skill levels and involvement by teachers and members of the community in providing physical and sport education in schools;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) the allocation and use of resources to physical and sport education in schools; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(d) the consistency of physical education and sports policies and programs, within and between schools and states.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee tabled its report on 16 December 1992, making 40 recommendations. The Government position on the Committee's report is broadly supportive of the intent of the majority of the recommendations. Some of the recommendations are within the province of the Commonwealth Government and its agencies and where appropriate, comments on the Commonwealth position are included in the separate response to relevant recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Constitutional responsibility for many of the other recommendations rests with the States and Territories and the Commonwealth sees its role as providing national leadership without exercising centralised control. Nevertheless, as indicated in the specific responses, the substance of a number of these recommendations has been taken up in the context of the Australian Education Council or directly with Ministers for Education. In addition, the Commonwealth has referred relevant recommendations to the Sport and Recreation Ministers' Council, which endorsed the principles contained in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As part of the process of formulating this response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee, the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, the Hon Ros Kelly MP, and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, the Hon Ross Free MP, wrote jointly to all State and Territory education ministers seeking their views on the report's recommendations and on the development of an implementation strategy. Where appropriate, the response also indicates where Mrs Kelly wrote separately to the State and Territory ministers with responsibility for sport and recreation matters, drawing their attention to the report's recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For ease of reporting, this response has followed the categories of recommendations as set out in the Committee's report with the exception of recommendation 17 which is being considered along with the recommendations under the National Education Curriculum heading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian school children have a right to expect a complete education&mdash;an education which, as well as providing a thorough grounding in academic subjects, also introduces them to the enjoyment and health benefits which flow from physical activity and a healthy lifestyle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These expectations must be met. The Commonwealth, State and Territory governments are obligated to continue to co-operate to ensure that physical and sport education is given a higher profile in school curricula.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If Australia's youth is to realise its full potential, it must be healthy, alert, capable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sportspeople of tomorrow will be drawn from the school children of today. To maximise the potential for success of an Australian team at the Sydney Olympics, we must increase the opportunities being offered to young Australians to participate in physical activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tabling this response to the Committee's report, the Government is encouraged by a number of significant and positive developments in the area of physical and sport education in some States and Territories in 1993. While these initiatives will go some way to redressing the decline in physical education in our schools system, much work remains to be done in some areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">NATIONAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government considers the recommendations concerning the National Curriculum Framework to be an important area of the Committee's work and has moved quickly to implement the relevant recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recent years the Commonwealth Government has worked collaboratively with States and Territories through the Australian Education Council (AEC) to provide a national perspective to school education, including physical education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of recommendations about establishing appropriate mechanisms to ensure consistent and timely implementation of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A statement on health and physical education for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health and physical education&mdash;a curriculum profile for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> have already been considered in the context of the AEC. All States and Territories are moving to use <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health and physical education&mdash;a curriculum profile for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> at some level from 1994. AEC members (now members of the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs) agreed to report on progress with implementation in each State and Territory in the first half of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 1:</EMPHASIS> That the National Statement on Health be renamed the National Education Statement on Health and Physical Education and that any subsequent documents reflect this more appropriate title. (Para 2.6)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation was accepted by the Australian Education Council, and it was agreed to change the name of the National Statement on Health to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A statement on health and physical education for Australian schools</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 2:</EMPHASIS> That the National Education Statement on Health and Physical Education be reconsidered to ensure full recognition for physical education as a national priority by identifying it as a separate Strand. (Para 2.14)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general thrust of the recommendation supports the Commonwealth's current policy to enhance the place of physical education within <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A statement on health and physical education for Australian schools </EMPHASIS>and the associated<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> Health and physical education&mdash;a curriculum profile for Australian schools</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This recommendation was addressed by the Australian Education Council and it was agreed that physical education will be incorporated across all strands in the curriculum statements and profiles.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 3:</EMPHASIS> That, before the National Education Statement on Health and Physical Education and associated Profiles are finalised, wider and better consultation take place, and that this consultation allow sufficient time for considered responses. (Para 2.17)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported in Principle</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The deadline for finalising curriculum statements and profiles was 30 June 1993. This deadline, though controversial, was set co-operatively, involving all States and Territories. The first editions of the curriculum statements and profiles are available for implementation commencing in 1994. Further consultations and reviews of the curriculum statements and profiles will depend on the outcomes of future meetings of the Commonwealth, State and Territory Education, Employment, Training and Youth Ministers and the establishment of a structure which will facilitate the co-ordination of national collaboration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 28:</EMPHASIS> That a minimum weekly time allocation for physical education, particularly in primary schools, be included in the National Statement on Health and Physical Education. (Para 5.8)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Noted</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Curriculum and teaching matters are primarily the responsibility of State and Territory governments. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A statement on health and physical education for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> provides a broad framework for teaching and learning outcomes in this curriculum area. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health and physical education&mdash;a curriculum profile for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> will assist education systems to meet the needs of all students as they progress through the learning levels and will provide a mechanism for encouraging all students to participate regularly in some form of physical activity and sports program. There is no provision in the curriculum statements and profiles to prescribe minimum time allocations for any component, including physical education. However, States and Territories may choose to specify time allocations. The profiles identify learning outcomes for students which will require varying amounts of time to achieve.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the Senate Committee's report was tabled, peak bodies including the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation, the Australian Schools Sports Council, the Australian Sports Commission, the Confederation of Australian Sport, National Sport Development Officers and Vicsport, have met to frame a common response and plan of action. As part of this response, to assist States and Territories who do choose to specify amounts of time for physical and sport education, it was agreed by the above groups that every Australian child during the compulsory school years should receive a minimum of 60 minutes of physical education every day at secondary school and 75 minutes a day in primary school. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation has written a Position Statement summarising recommendations for quality physical education programs in schools. This may assist schools to decide what is a minimum weekly time allocation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 4:</EMPHASIS> That the National Education Statement on Health and Physical Education and Profiles be rewritten to produce structured and comprehensive physical education programs for implementation in both primary and secondary schools. (Para 2.20)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Noted</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A statement on health and physical education for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health and physical education&mdash;a curriculum profile for Australian schools</EMPHASIS> provide a framework within which comprehensive and progressive health and physical education programs can be designed and developed at the State/Territory system and school level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 15:</EMPHASIS> That the Australian Education Council establish appropriate mechanisms to ensure States and Territories implement the National Statement on Health and Physical Education in a consistent and timely manner. (Para 2.48)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Education Council agreed to consider implementation issues related to the curriculum statements and profiles within their State and Territory education systems. Ministers have commissioned the Curriculum Corporation to co-ordinate the gathering of information for States and Territories and to report upon the implementation of the curriculum statements and profiles in the first half of 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the Commonwealth is providing funding for professional development to assist the implementation of the curriculum statements and profiles under the statement <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Teaching Counts</EMPHASIS> (released by the Hon Kim Beazley MP, Minister for Employment, Education and Training), it must be recognised that the simultaneous implementation of the curriculum statements and profiles in eight different learning areas from years 1 to 12 would place considerable strain on teaching resources across all systems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 17</EMPHASIS>: That the Department of Employment, Education and Training provide funds from the Curriculum Development Project Grant to establish physical education programs and to define particular physical education outcomes. (Para 3.5)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general thrust of this recommendation is supported by the current work on the national curriculum framework, particularly through its emphasis on developing positive attitudes to the role of physical activity within the overall health context of students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A critical prerequisite for the establishment of suitable physical education programs by teachers is adequate professional development. The Commonwealth has allocated $60 million over the next three years to provide a National Teachers' Professional Development Program. The Program will increase the knowledge base of teachers and foster within the profession the relearning culture which is increasingly demanded by society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the specific areas the Program will focus on is the implementation of the curriculum statements and profiles in all areas of learning. The curriculum statements and profiles will serve as guides for further program and syllabus development at the system and school level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The defining of particular physical education outcomes is one of the major purposes of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Health and physical education&mdash;a curriculum profile for Australian schools.</EMPHASIS> The first edition of this document was published in January 1994 and is available for implementation in the State and Territory education systems commencing in the 1994 school year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">STATE AND TERRITORY PE AND SPORT POLICIES FOR SCHOOLS</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RECOMMENDATION 5: That the Commonwealth, through the Australian Education Council, consult with the States and Territories to prepare and circulate detailed written policies for physical education as a matter of priority. (Para 2.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training wrote jointly to State and Territory Ministers for Education seeking comments on the report, including views on this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the development and implementation of physical education policies is a matter for State and Territory education systems and individual schools. The Australian Sports Commission (ASC) is willing to work with the professional teacher association, the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (ACHPER), the Department of Employment, Education and Training and State and Territory education authorities in the development of a model physical education policy. This can be provided to schools through the Curriculum Corporation. Through State and Territory based AUSSIE SPORT officers who retain links with State and Territory departments of education, the ASC will be able to provide advice to schools if required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, during 1993 a working party of sport and education representatives completed a national consultative process to develop a National Junior Sport Policy. This was co-ordinated by the Australian Sports Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 6:</EMPHASIS> That the Commonwealth, through the Australian Education Council, consult with States and Territories to ensure that they provide greater education department support for teachers responsible for physical education.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The development and implementation of sport policies in schools will be a matter for State and Territory education systems and individual schools. The Australian Sports Commission (ASC), in consultation with the Department of Employment, Education and Training, will support the development of a model school sport policy, through circulation of the National Junior Sport Policy. When printed in April 1994, it will be circulated to sporting groups and to all school systems. The Policy also can be provided to schools through the Curriculum Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Through the ASC and State and Territory based AUSSIE SPORT officers, schools are encouraged to seek advice about the AUSSIE SPORT school education programs. However, it is essential that the AUSSIE SPORT programs be used by State and Territory education departments to complement sound physical education programs, not act as a substitute for them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As this recommendation relates to matters within the constitutional responsibility of the States and Territories, the then Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories and the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training wrote jointly to State and Territory Ministers for Education seeking comments on the report, including views on this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth also referred this recommendation to the Sport and Recreation Ministers' Council, which endorsed the principles contained in the report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">RECOMMENDATION 8:</EMPHASIS> That future directions for physical education policies and curricula take account of the principles (outlined by ACHPER) which include recognition for the lifelong benefits from physical activity, both to individuals and the community. (Para 2.34)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Government Position: Supported</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In supporting the development of a model physical education policy for use by schools, the Australian Sports Commission has worked co-operatively with the Confederation of Australian Sport (CAS), the Australian Council for Health, Physical Education and Recreation (ACHPER) and a network of State/Territory education professionals, to promote and document the lifelong benefits of physical activity for individuals and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As an important contribution to the implementation of this recommendation, the then Federal Minister for Sport, the Hon Ros Kelly MP, initiated the development of an information package for distribution to Australian schools as well as a brochure for distribution to the Australian public. The package informed schools, parents and the public of the findings of the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts Report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Physical and Sport Education</EMPHASIS>. The distribution of the package was completed in November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The package to school principals and parent associations included a:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The information contained in the package was developed by the Australian Sports Commission and ACHPER. Other groups, including the Confederation of Australian Sport (CAS), Australian Sports Goods Association (ASGA), State/Territory education/sport professionals and the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts were consulted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The brochure has also been made widely available to the public with the generous support of sport retail stores, local sports clubs, Pizza Hut restaurants, and other agencies. It outlines the importance of sport for children and informs the public about the decline of physical and sport education in some schools. The purpose of the brochure is to encourage parents and citizens to take practical actions which might assist and support local schools in the provision of sound physical and sport education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In developing and distributing this package, it was recognised that the future directions for physical education policies adopted by schools will be determined by State and Territory education systems and individual schools.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Origin of inquiry</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. The basis for the Committee's inquiry arose from the Report of the Joint Select Committee on Corporations Legislation, which recommended in April 1989 that the matter of the Shield of the Crown be referred to a Parliamentary Committee for further examination. The Joint Select Committee made this recommendation because of concerns expressed during hearings held by the Joint Select Committee on the Corporations Bill 1988 that certain State corporations had relied on the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown to avoid the requirements of statutory commercial frameworks and obstruct the activities of the National Companies and Securities Commission ("NCSC").</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. In its submission to the Joint Select Committee, the NCSC had noted that it had become increasingly common for bodies which enjoyed the Shield of the Crown to rely upon it to avoid regulatory requirements. It was stated that such bodies were under no obligation to make timely disclosure to the market of the type required to be made by any other market participant. Further, the NCSC noted that it could be argued that associates of such Crown bodies were also immune from the obligation to make disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Committee received 23 written submissions, the most recent on 25 March 1992, from a range of sources, including Commonwealth and State Departments and statutory authorities, local government bodies and legal professional bodies. The Government acknowledges the contributions of all those who made submissions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Development of the doctrine</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The doctrine of the Shield of the Crown is concerned with the extension of the immunities and privileges of the Crown to persons and bodies who are separate from the Crown but are closely related to it. The Committee focused on the doctrine in so far as it related to the Crown's immunity from the application of statutes, considering it to be the most significant of the immunities and privileges covered by the doctrine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. Over time, the privileges and immunities that were originally enjoyed personally by the Monarch were extended, for example, to the Ministers of the Crown and government departments, and then to some bodies that are not strictly part of the Crown or the government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. The Committee found that the modern proliferation of public bodies makes it extremely difficult to accurately categorise the exact types of bodies that may or may not enjoy the benefit of the Crown's immunity from statute. The Committee noted that, during the 19th century, courts in the United Kingdom relied on a `functions test' to determine the status of statutory corporations. This judicial approach survived into the 20th century, and for many years was applied by Australian courts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. Later, in the place of the functions test, the courts turned to a test based on the relationship between the corporation and the State. This involved consideration of the extent of control exercised by Ministers of the Crown over the body in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">10. On the related question of whether statutes bound the Crown, the traditional English rule, as enunciated in Province of Bombay v Municipal Corporation of the City of Bombay [1947] AC 58 held that a statute could only bind the Crown by express words or necessary implication. Until the decision in Bropho v State of Western Australia &amp; Anor [1990] 93 ALR 207, Australian courts also applied the Bombay case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Continuing relevance of the doctrine</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11. While the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown has been a part of English and Australian law for several centuries, in recent times its relevance has been increasingly questioned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12. Two main factors have contributed to this. The first is the growth in the size and complexity of government, particularly during the last one hundred and fifty years. With this has come a trend for government to operate through statutory corporations and other bodies, with various degrees of autonomy from ministerial control. Many of these corporations and bodies are involved in commercial activities, sometimes in competition with the private sector. This trend must inevitably continue with budgetary pressure on government bodies to recover their costs and to operate within the disciplines to which ordinary commercial bodies are subject.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">13. The second factor, related to the first, is the view that governments and government bodies, particularly government bodies performing commercial activities, should not be accorded special privileges and should, so far as possible, operate on an equal footing with ordinary citizens. In relation to government business enterprises, there is also the perception that the existence of special privileges is inconsistent with the general competitive environment in which other businesses operate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. A third, lesser but not insignificant, factor is the difficulty often experienced, even by trained lawyers, in determining whether a body shares in the privileges of government or falls within the Shield of the Crown. This exercise often involves time-consuming and costly assessments of the degree of independence from ministerial control enjoyed by the body. Even then there may remain a degree of legal uncertainty which may only be finally settled in costly and time-consuming legal proceedings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Committee also considered that the Shield doctrine could have adverse impacts on commercial markets and regulatory frameworks. Not only could a Crown body use the doctrine to gain unfair advantages in its commercial dealings, but parties dealing with it directly, for example as commercial partners, could also share the benefit of Crown immunity. In the Committee's view, the doctrine seemed in some respects to be fundamentally inconsistent with the policy objectives of reforms to both State and Federal authorities and GBEs. Another possible result of the doctrine might be to frustrate various legislative schemes such as the Trade Practices Act or the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The Committee considered that activities of the State in the commercial field should not enjoy the special privileges and benefits attributable to the Shield of the Crown doctrine. In the view of the Committee, the modern State's pursuit of varied, often commercial, undertakings required that legislation intended to protect and further public goals should apply equally to all sectors of the community&mdash;including the State.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Report of Independent Committee of Inquiry into National Competition Policy</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">17. Since the tabling of the Committee's Report, a Report by an Independent Committee of Inquiry into National Competition Policy (the `Hilmer Report') has also made a recommendation concerning the application of the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown in relation to the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Hilmer Report recommends that the current limitations in the application of competitive conduct rules arising from the Shield of the Crown doctrine be removed from the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, the States and Territories in so far as the Crown in question carries on a business or engages in commercial activity in competition (actual or potential) with other businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Committee's recommendations</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. The Committee's recommendations, together with the Government's responses, are as follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 1</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the common law doctrine of the Shield of the Crown should be clarified and reformed particularly in so far as it applies to government business enterprises and statutory authorities. The Commonwealth, the States and the Territories should consult together about the issue at high level for example, at the meetings of the Council of Australian Governments or through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. The Committee noted that the problems created by the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown involved Commonwealth, State and Territory organisations and the relationship between federal and State laws. The Committee said that to achieve effective and consistent legislative change throughout Australia, given our federal system of government, required a cooperative approach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. The Government supports this recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. The recommendation of the Hilmer Report concerning the application of the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown in relation to the Trade Practices Act 1974 is being addressed by the Council of Australian Governments in the context of its overall consideration of that report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. The remaining issues will in the first instance be progressed through the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General. The Commonwealth Attorney-General will write to his State and Territory colleagues on that Committee to seek to have the matter placed on the Committee's agenda at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 2</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that in so far as the common law doctrine of the Shield of the Crown presently applies to government business enterprises and statutory authorities, it should be replaced by legislation setting out criteria in the light of which their entitlement to immunity can be determined. The legislation should be based on a modified opt out scheme. This should minimise the need for prolix and costly monitoring of new enactments which might be necessary were a full opt out scheme adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">23. The Government proposes to advance this recommendation by the Committee to the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General and ask that Committee give careful consideration to the approach suggested by the Senate Committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">24. The Commonwealth's legislative powers would not, of course, extend to making provision with respect to the position in relation to the Shield of the Crown generally of State bodies. Any Commonwealth legislation could only address the position of Commonwealth and Territory bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. While the Commonwealth supports the general proposition that the application of the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown should be clarified and, in the case at least of government business enterprises, abrogated, by legislation, the form which such legislation should take will need to be carefully considered. Legislation which merely set out criteria by which an entitlement to immunity can be determined, as suggested by the Committee, may not be sufficient to remove any uncertainty which has traditionally surrounded this area of law. However, there are a number of other legislative options open to the Commonwealth in relation to its own bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">26. One option is that pursued in the Commonwealth's unsuccessful attempt to clarify the application of Commonwealth, State and Territory laws to the Commonwealth and Commonwealth instrumentalities, i.e. in the Government and Government Instrumentalities (Application of Laws) Bill 1990. That Bill provided, in relation to Commonwealth instrumentalities, that all laws would automatically apply to them (subject to a provision for opting out of the application of particular laws through regulations made within 12 months before the provisions relating to Commonwealth instrumentalities came into force). While this aspect of the Bill did not attract opposition, the Bill ultimately foundered because of other matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">27. Another option would be simply to adopt a policy of expressly covering the matter of Shield of the Crown in legislation setting up new bodies and examining the position of existing bodies on a case by case basis and amending individual constituting legislation, as required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. The Government will endeavour to devise a satisfactory legislative solution to the problem of the application of the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown in modern circumstances, at least in so far as it affects government business enterprises and other bodies conducting activities on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Recommendation 3</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee recommends that the Joint Standing Committee on Corporations and Securities inquire into the effect the doctrine of the Shield of the Crown has on the Australian Securities Commission's ability to exercise its powers when dealing with government business enterprises and statutory authorities and to make such recommendations for reform as seem appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">29. The Committee considered that there was a need for a comprehensive inquiry into how the doctrine impacts on the ASC's ability to exercise its relevant powers when dealing with government business enterprises and statutory authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">30. The Government endorses this recommendation and will ask the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities to look into the issues raised at the earliest opportunity.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate at the end of each period of sittings a schedule listing Government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The practice of presenting this schedule to the Senate follows the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. More recently the Government has advised that responses to committee reports will be made by letter to a committee chairman, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The date of the presentation of the Government's response to the Senate has been taken as the date that the response is presented, not the date of any correspondence with the committee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The schedule does not include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the Senate Standing Committees on Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances and Scrutiny of Bills. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered. Responses to reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts are usually made in the form of Finance Minutes which are tabled by the committee. Where a response has been made by</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the Auditor-General's report No. 31 which is a project audit into the CSIRO's information technology security. This is an incredible report because it demonstrates that in the very sensitive area of information, the CSIRO in its computer arrangements has had a minimal, almost non-existent, level of security. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one recognises that security of technical information can involve multimillions of dollars worth of knowledge it is absolutely incredible that CSIRO has not in fact been able to provide any kind of effective security for its information. I will quote some key points from the Auditor-General's report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This audit of CSIRO addressed the important role of computer security and focused on the custodianship of scientific data within the Organisation. The audit also examined responses to a series of break ins to the computer facilities through the external Australia-wide network operated by the Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANOA found that the CSIRO network and computing facilities have evolved without the establishment of effective computing and management arrangements to ensure that the organisation is a good custodian of its data holdings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Specifically the audit found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">an absence of computer and network security policies and directions</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.limited assessment of the value of data and its vulnerability to loss, corruption and disclosure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.limited direction through standards and `good practice statements' across CSIRO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.ineffective security over unauthorised access to computer facilities through the network</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.inadequate resourcing of the management and operation of computer facilities, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.poor control of security of data held in personal computers.</PARA>
<PARA>The audit office says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A good reputation for well managed scientific and industrial research is essential as CSIRO becomes increasingly reliant on outside funding. The organisation has not established policies and strategies to ensure appropriate custodianship of its data resources and as a result there is no clear responsibility or accountability for data security. The data produced by its scientific research and commercial activities represents one of the most material assets of CSIRO, despite this there is no imperative for assessing the value of these assets and determining the organisation's vulnerability to their loss. The ANAO is concerned that only one of the 11 sites visited had adequate security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendations designed to improve computer security across the Organisation were made and the ANAO considers that these should be implemented immediately. These recommendations include the:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.establishment of policies to ensure awareness of the need and responsibility for computer security</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.conduct of risk analysis and threat assessments to provide an effective base for the implementation of security</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.development of computer standards and good practice statements along with programs to ensure implementation and continuing compliance, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.need to ensure that adequate resources with appropriate skills are available to support computer facilities and users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of breaches of network security were investigated during the audit. As a result, management was advised to ensure:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.appropriate network security for individual computer sites within CSIRO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.all connections to external networks were secure</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.a single central authority is responsible for coordinating any response to a network breach, and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.computer managers are provided with guidance and are aware of the process to be adopted in the event of a breach.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the ANAO provided specific technical recommendations to each of the sites reviewed during the audit.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following the series of external breaches of network security, the Organisation established a Network Security Task Force to review and recommend policies and strategies to ensure high security levels for the network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Task Force reported in February 1994 and its findings and recommendations were accepted by the Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CSIRO accepted the ANAO recommendations and acknowledged that it had not sufficiently assessed the risks associated with its computer operations. It added, however, that there are computers which store key commercial data where precautions had been taken to limit risk by avoiding connection to the network.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisation advised that it is moving rapidly to enforce the principle of assessing risks and acting accordingly, particularly through the application of policy and adoption of best practices.</PARA>
<PARA>This practice of security breaches is very significant. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These breaches resulted in unauthorised access to a number of CSIRO computer systems. It may never be possible to determine the full extent of these breaches of computer security. The first detection of a breach in network security was in January 1991. A further breach was detected in 1992 and a series of breaches occurred over the period December 1992 to January 1993. It is believed that these breaches were the work of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">hackers</EMPHASIS>, perpetrated by individuals for `fun' rather than for material gain. There have been police investigations of the breaches and, in at least one case, successful criminal prosecution.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite breaches occurring over a two-year period, the ANAO found that the Organisation had not developed response mechanisms to effectively recognise and isolate breaches, investigate causes and control damage. The audit found that there was no area with responsibility and authority to deal with the situation from a corporate point of view.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to commend the Auditor-General for yet another very effective report. I want to note that while the Auditor-General says that it concluded that the reputation of CSIRO was at risk because it did not have appropriate mechanisms to ensure that it is a good custodian of scientific and commercial information held on computer systems, the CSIRO acknowledged that it has not sufficiently assessed the risks associated with its computer operations and advised that this point is now being addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation commented that while it did not contest the vital point of risk assessment within CSIRO, there are computers which store key commercial information where the decision has been made to avoid network connection to limit the risk. It emphasised that it was important for its key commercial partners to be aware that precautions had been taken at several key points, where a very high liability would exist if data were lost or stolen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least there is that recognition by CSIRO. May I say how depressing it is that a body which has an outstanding record for technical and scientific research and handles such significant and valuable information which has led to very significant technological breakthroughs in Australia&mdash;some of which, I regret to say, has had to be developed and produced overseas&mdash;for so long had this lack of appreciation of the importance of the security of the information it has in computer systems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the Auditor-General, who has once again done this parliament an immense service. It underlines the need, as every one of these reports does, for this government to get off the Auditor-General's back and to stop trying to squeeze the department for money and to freeze its resources. Over the last few years the government has been ripping off the department with its incredible rent at the Labor-owned Centenary House where the Auditor-General is a tenant. The government needs to follow through with its undertaking that it will examine the prospect of the Auditor-General being directly funded by and responsible to the parliament, instead of having to put up with the uncertain funding future of a government which is clearly hostile to the great job the Auditor-General is doing. </PARA>

<PARA>I have great pleasure in moving this motion in regard to the celebration of wool week which commences today. I speak today in support of the wool industry, an industry that has made a unique and immense contribution to our great country. For a week, starting today, the political system helps focus the attention of the wider Australian community on wool related issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All nations, all peoples, must sometimes spend a little time celebrating their past. Wool has played a pivotal part in Australia's development and it will play a pivotal part in the future. Without wool, we would never have opened up our hinterland. Without wool, the transport systems would have been even worse than they are now. Without wool, the infrastructures and towns of rural Australia would be a shadow of what we have. It was wool that put us near the top of the world's standard of living in the early part of this century. Without it, we would not have had the standard of living that all Australians now enjoy. It was wool that encouraged many impoverished Scots to this distant country, of which I am most thankful. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The young nation rode very proudly on the sheep's back. It was, in retrospect, a mighty comfortable ride. Without wool, the identity we have of our sun bleached land, much of the wry humour, much of the courage of the Australian light-horse and the many who rode to husband the nation's sheep in the outback would not have been. But as I speak, there is a continuing heartache for many woolgrowers&mdash;the inheritors of the 200 years of hard work that developed Australia's first great industry. There is an old saying in the bush: the worse things get, the better they will get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time will bring the long hoped for change in market sentiment and confidence. The first flicker of light that is appearing in the world's economies is starting to be seen in our marketplace. Wool has seen difficult times before, and will in the future, but the increase in market confidence, the Garnaut recommendations which I substantially endorse, the ending of the most recent drought in much of the north-west of New South Wales and most of Queensland, have all placed Australia's 60,000 woolgrowers in a position where they can have cautious optimism. I endorse that optimism. My family's wellbeing and the wellbeing of the people who work for me are dependent upon it, so I do not place that optimism lightly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For wool's recovery to continue, the government must address a number of uncertainties. First and foremost is the uncertainty over interest rates. The possibility that interest rates will rise again&mdash;particularly to anything approaching the rates of the late 1980s&mdash;fills many farmers with despair. No-one was unaffected by them. Interest rates alone, more than low commodity prices, have taken the stuffing out of a generation of Australian farmers and have left many rural areas in near desperation. Very often it has been the best, brightest, most innovative and expanding farmers in their 40s and 50s who have really been let down by the 1980s interest regime of this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Next, the uncertainty surrounding the sufficiency of funds for promotion must be urgently addressed. Professor Garnaut made special mention of the government's decision not to fund wool promotion next year when he said that it is `particularly unfortunate that at this difficult time the Australian woolgrower will be left to carry the burden of promotion alone'. Woolgrowers themselves have made very considerable contributions to promotion which this year will be around $85 million&mdash;down from around $170 million in the 1980s when prices and production were higher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are only two ways to increase demand for a demand-led industry. The first is the lowering in price; the second is promotion. The lowering of price, whilst involuntary, has had the most rapid effect. As Professor Garnaut says, woolgrowers have, by accepting the lowest ever real prices, exported more wool in the last two years than in any time in Australia's history. We have regained market share from cotton and synthetics and recreated demand because of price, even with one of our major buyers, the CIS, virtually out of the market. Even with these record low prices, growers have continued to contribute a 4.5 per cent tax to cover the errors sanctioned by the previous minister, John Kerin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second means of increasing demand in the longer term is by promotion. The government's contribution ceases in June 1994. Considering the amount of tax paid by growers in the 1980s, the current government contribution of $20 million for 1993-94 is a drop in the ocean. For more than three years the International Wool Secretariat has been unable to meet its proper promotion program. The shortfall, which is around $100 million this year, means that any substantial advertising campaign in the major consumer countries&mdash;the United States, Japan and Europe&mdash;is impossible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The IWS is to be congratulated on working with manufacturers and retailers. But the impossibility of advertising to end users in every country except China, which is very cheap, means that we are missing out as consumer confidence returns. In simple terms, the protection of wool's most tangible and obvious asset, the wool symbol, is under threat. This is a symbol that rates with the symbol of Mercedes Benz and Coca-Cola. We must protect it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins has said that he will fight as fiercely as he can for his portfolio. The promotion budget is vital and I believe that the minister understands this. I remind the minister of the ALP rural policy statement in the 1993 federal election. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Labor will work with the industry, the Australian Wool Corporation and the International Wool Secretariat to develop a three-year funding package to ensure continued and effective promotion of wool.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that this will not turn out to be yet another broken promise. Further, when will the promised contribution from the International Wool Textile Organisation to help wool promotion be forthcoming? The minister has yet to give an update on this vital promotion plank that flowed from the Garnaut changes and recommendations. It is time for some lateral thinking on funding wool promotion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next uncertainty for growers is the falling contribution to research and development carried out substantially by the CSIRO's Division of Wool Technology. The IWS does research into raw wool as well, but Australia's own Division of Wool Technology has done vital and substantial research in raw wool. Objective measurement technology is one of many areas where it has directed its energies. In simple terms, the contribution of the industry to R&amp;D is matched dollar for dollar by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the industry's contribution is still substantial, with the fall in production and price the government's dollar for dollar share has fallen by $8 million&mdash;44 per cent&mdash;to $11.2 million over the last three years. That is a saving to the government of $8 million. This is a considerable saving and the apparent power struggle between the board of the CSIRO and the Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, about the setting of research priorities will hopefully be sorted out to the advantage of the Division of Wool Technology before too much longer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A key industry development is the establishment of the Australian trade investment packages as recommended in the Garnaut report. Both the Minister for Trade, Senator McMullan, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, have agreed to co-chair ATIP and the industry is very hopeful that these will enhance the development of textile industries in developing countries. However, with bilateral trade negotiations ongoing, we have been disappointed until today when we heard what Senator Collins had to say. But we are disappointed that the government has been slow to adopt these recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian wool industry is anxious to see the full adoption of the GATT agreement. International trade in wool apparel is currently significantly restricted by the multi-fibre arrangement. Under the MFA the United States of America, Western Europe and Japan place quantitative restrictions on the importation of garments. The MFA is inconsistent with GATT principles and Australian woolgrowers encourage the government to maintain pressure during bilateral negotiations with the USA, Western Europe and Japan to see the phasing out of the MFA as agreed during the GATT negotiations. The rural adjustment scheme advisory committee recently met to consider extending exceptional circumstances for woolgrowers, and I hope it agreed to extend the extension.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to contribute to today's debate on National Wool Week. Someone once said to me, when we were talking about western Queensland, `Its a great place to live: 50 million blowflies can't be wrong'. I guess the same might be said about Australia being a place to live because 140 million or so sheep cannot be wrong. On a more serious note, however, as is my inclination, I want to concentrate my remarks today on the human side of our wool industry. In particular, I want to pay tribute to all Australian woolgrowers and to all people involved in the wool industry in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want also to outline the Democrat's blueprint for what we believe is needed to address the problems faced by our woolgrowers and by Australians in all rural areas. Of all the primary producers, our woolgrowers have had perhaps the toughest time of all over the last few years. The history of the collapse of the reserve price for wool is well known to all by now, and I do not want to revisit that debate. Since that time, however, returns for Australian woolgrowers have been decimated. Late last year when we were considering the Garnaut report into Australia's wool industry, I had the opportunity to meet with a good many woolgrowers and certainly had my faith restored in their determination to stick to Australia. I hope that, through this debate and certainly many other things we do in this place, we as Australians might also stick to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to people such as those in the Balmoral branch of the Victorian Farmers Federation who provided a contrary point of view to many others in this place, but, nevertheless, put themselves on the line in seeking to help all of us understand what was needed. I hope that the structures and procedures put in place by the legislation which emanated last year from the Garnaut report will see the wool industry return to profitability in a short period of time. I note that the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, ABARE, has estimated that the average wool market indicator price for this financial year will be in the order of 485c per kilogram. Importantly, ABARE also estimates this average will rise to 530c in 1994-95. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently, due mainly to an increase in the demand for the finer grade wools, we have seen something of a recovery in wool prices to the point where the eastern market indicator is currently at around 566c. Still, there is a belief amongst many in the wool industry that before wool growing returns to profitability the price will need to rise to around 600c. As we all know, the major obstacle to that happening is the existence of our enormous wool stockpile. Again, ABARE estimates that sales from the stockpile during the next year should see it reduced to around 3 million bales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed recently that Wool International has actually begun trialling sales of small quantities of the stockpile prior to the commencement of the fixed schedule sell-off due to begin on 1 July this year. I can only hope that the optimistic future for wool that many painted for it when the legislation establishing Wool International was debated last year is actually realised. As we all know, poor returns over a number of years have seen many woolgrowers forced out of the industry while the survival of many of those who remain in the industry is only marginal. That is a tragedy of mammoth proportions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noted figures recently released showing the area in Australia, as defined by postcodes, with the lowest average taxable income was Archdale in western Victoria with an average income of just $14,790. It turns out that Archdale is a sheep and wool farming area. The Australian Democrats believe the government needs to undertake a whole range of measures to help support our wool industry and more generally to support all primary producers and rural communities such as Archdale. As honourable senators will be aware, the Democrats earlier this week submitted measures to the government that we saw as priorities for this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to go over just a few of those measures as they apply to woolgrowers and to our rural communities.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Inall,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I recently presented a paper at a "Rural Crisis"&mdash;Grain farmers meeting in the `Mallee'&mdash;Karoonda, S.A. The content of my talk mostly centred around the health aspects&mdash;emotional/physical of the continued stress and uncertainty caused by the severe economic downturn in the rural economy&mdash;in short the "Rural Crisis". It is easy to say "Rural Crisis"&mdash;I think I have said it a thousand times since coming here to work as a solo country G.P. 5 years ago. This crisis has certainly been a very real entity to me&mdash;stress related illness is at an all time high. It's probably been the most difficult in the last 2 years, with a worsening of the commodity price situation. We have seen it all in the last 5 years&mdash;poor rains, severe winds, hail, thunderstorm damage, too much rain, mouse plagues, frosts etc. In the normal cycle of things natures little temper tantrums would be accounted for, but not now. This year is critical for the survival of not just 10-20% but just about all&mdash;sheep/grain growers in this district despite near record harvest yields over the last 2 years&mdash;yes record harvests. Prices have been so low that the normal "recovery" with a good crop hasn't occurred. The crisis continues and this district just like most of Rural Australia is suffering from the lack of coordinated approach to management of these problems. A crisis by definition needs to be managed&mdash;"a time of extreme trouble or danger"&mdash;"a crucial stage or turning point in the course of anything". I believe that the extent and depth of the rural crisis hasn't been addressed adequately by our governments. There is no doubt that "change" is imminent and that more families will leave the land, but I fear if certain issues are not addressed quickly the critical number will be reached, the damage will be irreversible, resulting in the complete collapse of "hinterland" Rural Australia. There maybe dramatic social and economic effects. Are we to have no rural economy?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Government of course cannot do the impossible&mdash;the fickleness of nature and overseas markets are to a certain degree out of our control, but a government can ask the following question. Does Australia want a Rural Recovery/Industry? If the answer is YES then everyone concerned&mdash;Farmer Organisations&mdash;State&mdash;Federal Governments alike need to look at all possible ways of bringing relief to give viable farmers a chance to survive the next 5 years and reshape/reorganise a new rural industry, hopefully stronger and more profitable. More profitable for every Australian&mdash;hopefully a strong rural economy means jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One issue that can help is for a relaxation of the Assets Test when applied to farming couples at retirement age, who may seek some financial security through the old age pension. I have counselled many patients relating to their frustration on this issue. I am sure that many farming families are trapped&mdash;the senior couple may still have their name on the land title. They have in effect a unrealisable asset&mdash;they are unlikely to sell "their share", if their son/daughter is carrying on with the family farm. Presently the son/daughter may well not be able to buy them out either, so Mum &amp; Dad continue to depend on the struggling farm for their livelihood&mdash;unable to retire, unable to in many situations obtain the aged pension because of the "assets". I might add that in many instances the valuation put on the land bears little relationship to "real" values in this rural depression. The method of valuation needs scrutinizing ? values at today's prices or those higher levels of 5 years ago. There appears to be some social injustice in this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments need to totally rethink the eligibility criteria for those farmers reaching retirement age and with family willing to continue on with the farm. If the younger farming family is to have any chance of survival, then Mum &amp; Dad must get off the farm. People are suffering because of this anomaly. If it were redressed then some farms may just be helped enough to survive. It's one thing that could help.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So a lot of farmers may well go and leave the industry&mdash;if you are 40 or 50 years old you hopefully will have a chance of retraining but ? what hope if > 60 years old with the unemployment levels presently endured. If the older farmer has large debt he/she may be very fortunate to leave with some cash, many may have little equity and consequently have no funds or at most the $45,000 adjustment figure if they are `lucky'. They will struggle to re establish themselves ? where will they live ? will they apply for a housing trust home and go on the end of the list behind thousands of other unfortunate Australians looking for housing options. I offer the following solution to be given serious thought as we&mdash;Karoonda District Hospital &amp; Karoonda East Murray District Council&mdash;already foresaw this problem and have established a Community Housing Committee to oversee the redevelopment of some disused and derelict railway homes. We were fortunate to be successful in gaining $24,000 from a Local Government Housing Grant (yes $24,000 only) which enabled us to buy the two houses from the State Transport Authority. The money to refurbish the houses (now almost complete) has come directly out of our already struggling community&mdash;1/2 Hospital, 1/2 Council. The houses have been done up relatively cheaply re low capital costs and provided employment for local people&mdash;taken on by local builders who have done the rebuilding and hopefully will house local/district people disadvantaged and/or displaced from their farms. Those farmers near retirement age are our priority, especially if they may also have medical problems.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe our project is worthy of further analysis and if we could get some further support we may acquire some other houses&mdash;some government owned and do the same. The victims of the rural crisis need to be housed like anybody else&mdash;why not keep them in Rural Australia where they want to be and help keep our town and others alive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Karoonda has focused on developing a good environment for retirees&mdash;excellent Hospital facilities with focus on age care, good retirement facilities etc. We want to survive and the idea of becoming a retirement town for rural people is something worth pursuing. We have had some help with establishing a "dementia care unit" and day care centre&mdash;all we need is for continuing support to build on our assets. We are well placed geographically to fulfil this objective. Many rural people can no longer think of retiring to regional towns or holiday resorts. The costs have largely outstripped their resources. The concept of locally controlled rental/public housing specifically targeted to "rural retirees", I believe deserves merit. We can do it cheaper because of reduced input costs&mdash;land/ housing etc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The consequence of letting the "crisis" work itself out, "unmanaged" may be more costly than the intervention. Consider the scenario of large blocks of land not being actively farmed, particularly in this area&mdash;because the farmer owners have left or not been given finance. Land may not be sold and therefore who carries on the land management&mdash;it's no good ignoring it, as a block may quickly become weed/vermin over run and pose a threat to neighbouring land still being worked. ? What is the answer I don't know, but the consequences of not looking at the problems are again potentially quite severe&mdash;environmental degradation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have raised a few issues, which are hopefully, noteworthy of analysis and further consideration. I ask that you please consider the consequences of the ongoing `rural crisis' / debt in economic and personal human terms. The last few years have been stressful for everyone living in Rural Australia. The issue of the eligibility/assets test is important and needs urgent redress in the next 12 months/budget calculations. I believe the housing issue is also very real and worthy of some thought ? I am sure there would be other towns in this and other states that could take on this focus with some support from Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Rural Australia wants to help itself in this period of readjustment, but the many problems need to be recognised and solutions found by working with government&mdash;Local, State &amp; Federal to ensure viable rural communities survive and grow into the next century.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You just have to watch the TV&mdash;current affairs or read the paper to realize many sections of the Australian Community are "hurting". The problems facing Rural Australia and particularly agriculture/wool producers are no more or less important than Metropolitan Issues&mdash;they are equally important and need to be addressed with equal vigour and</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me turn now to just some of the measures which we believe are important and which we would press on the government in the coming period of budget discussions. Firstly, we would extend the investment allowance for primary producers. Our farm sector is just starting to see some decent farm incomes after years of very low, and in the case of the wool industry, often negative incomes. In the current financial year the government provided the business and farming sectors with access to a 10 per cent investment allowance to assist in retooling plant. For corporate Australia this has been useful, as with its return to profits it has been able to take advantage of the allowance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For farmers, however, the recovery of incomes has been much slower. This has greatly reduced the capacity of rural industries to take advantage of the allowance. In recognition of this, we believe we need to provide an extension of the investment allowance for rural producers for the 12 months to December 1995, and we note the support of the National Farmers Federation for this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the Democrats would provide far greater access to our social security system for farm families. We have pointed out many times in this place that rural families are often asset rich but income poor. As a consequence, they are unable to access government support despite being in dire financial straits. We have long campaigned for the government to exempt the family farm from the assets test for basic and additional family payments, and we reaffirmed this in our submission for this year's budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was horrified to receive a fax recently which indicated that people are currently being denied access to the interest rate subsidy available to all farmers on the grounds that they receive an additional family payment and, therefore, supposedly, are unable to cover farming costs. This is clearly unfair, particularly in view of the fact that family payments are made in recognition of the value and costs of raising children. The Democrats will be urging the government to rectify this problem immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also proposed to the government that the home care child allowance be doubled. This would provide greater benefit to farming families than the alternative of income splitting, as canvassed by some in the opposition, because of the low level of tax often paid by farmers. Thirdly, we have called for a regional environmental employment program to not only increase employment opportunities in rural and regional areas but also address major rural environmental problems such as erosion, re-vegetation, farm forestry, weed control, conservation management, biodiversity projects, feral animal control, waste management and recycling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, we advocate increased funding to maintain government services in rural areas. This has been one of the most devastating factors in the decline in population in rural areas. Because so many government services have been withdrawn, country towns have suffered. The trend must be reversed. Our budget submission has proposed $50 million to finance community service obligations in order to maintain government services in rural areas where the withdrawal of those services would have a significant adverse impact on employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also proposed a major boost to public investment in infrastructure to include such things as upgrading of rural freight facilities and waste water management. We have pleaded with the government, and would do so again, that the rural counselling scheme be maintained and not cut by $2 million, as has been proposed in 1994-95. We believe that the scheme should not be cut but extended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural counselling scheme, which aims to provide financial and other advice to farmers to explore their options, has been a cost-effective and well received scheme. Funding must be maintained at its 1993-94 level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I bring to the attention of the Senate the need to address large differences in prices paid for fuel in the cities compared with country areas.

We want to pursue a more efficient energy market, appropriate mechanisms to encourage lower prices and competition in country areas, with pricing regulation and subsidisation if necessary. Each and every one of the measures I have just mentioned is essential for securing the future of our woolgrowers and, indeed, of our rural communities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to Senator McGauran that I do not think any shearer has ever thought himself to be particularly special. Rather, a shearer is often confronted with a very difficult job and usually gets on and does it. We have to look to the history of the wool industry to make some analysis of the circumstance it was confronted with very recently. Yes, it has been a major contributor to the economy of this country over a long period and, indeed, for most of country Australia it was the very fabric of the country in terms of employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was unfortunate that for so many years we left this industry to its own devices. There was no real consideration of how we should shape the future of the industry, and it ultimately took a very difficult occurrence, almost a disaster, for the industry to actually start to put things right. Having met many of the woolgrowers involved in the industry, having shorn in every state in this country bar Western Australia, I have great admiration for people in outback Australia. Not only do they have a difficult enough job looking after sheep out there along with however many million blowflies Senator Woodley was talking about, but also the climate they have to put up with is tough enough in itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the peaks and troughs the industry has been confronted with, production has been based on the price of wool.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased to support Senator Macdonald's motion to celebrate National Wool Week. I recognise the enormous contribution the wool industry has made to Australia and will continue to make to the economy and the Australian people. It is one of Australia's oldest industries, if not the oldest. It is Australia's biggest user of land and the biggest employer of  agricultural labour. When the wool industry is suffering, it harms other agricultural enterprises and the Australian economy in general.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It came as no surprise to me that with the downturn in the wool industry provincial cities such as Hamilton, in western Victoria, suffered an immediate downturn in retail turnover and economic development generally. In its own way, the decline of the wool industry over the last few years&mdash;momentary I am sure&mdash;contributed to the overall result of the recent recession. There is no denying the crisis the wool industry is facing at present with low wool prices and a huge stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a large number of woolgrowers under considerable financial stress with negligible or negative incomes. However, the future is not gloomy and it is on the prospect of a much brighter future rather than the gloom of the past that I wish to address my remarks today. If we act carefully there are opportunities to build the wool industry into a very strong and sustainable industry. The advantage today compared to the wool crisis in 1970 and 1971 is that today there is demand for wool. In 1991-92 and 1992-93 the amount of wool exported from Australia was close to the highest in any two-year period in Australia's history. In fact, as recently as last week, on Thursday, 17 March <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The</EMPHASIS> <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> newspaper noted that for the second successive week China had been the major buyer and supporter of Australia's firming wool markets. Medium and long-term predictions for demand indicate that buyers' support will be reasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we take into account that the income growth in countries with cool and cold climates such as China, Japan and Europe will be considerable in the next decade, we can see there is great opportunity for the marketing and promotion of wool. Also, the rise in disposable income in nearer Asian countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia should lead to a greater demand for high fashion garments. This, combined with technological developments in the way that wool can be used in warm climates, augurs well for future markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only six years ago, in 1988, wool was our No. 1 export, earning Australia $6 billion in overseas sales. We need to get our industry back to that position. The Garnaut report, to which Senator Macdonald has already alluded, recommended three areas which the wool industry should focus on: firstly, the expansion of international trade in wool and woollen products; secondly, the establishment of industry bodies with a clear commercial focus; and, thirdly, the establishment of new market mechanisms for marketing wool. Integrating the farm with the marketplace has been identified as one of the structural changes that need to occur within the industry to make it more focused. For those people who remain in the industry, this is one of the answers. The product must be right to compete in this international world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The past few years have not been easy for the wool industry. While the term `true believers' is more usually applied to a certain political party, it could also be used to describe those in the wool industry who remain totally committed to the future of wool, despite four years of immense uncertainty and difficulty. During that time we have seen the removal of the reserve price, the collapse of markets in the Soviet Union, indifferent seasons here in Australia, and increasing competition from synthetics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I salute and congratulate those farmers and processors who have shown qualities of grit and integrity. I urge them to stay on the land and believe in the people who live there. They believe in their product. Other farmers, I regret to say, have been forced to leave their farms. Farmers are very proud people and they do not like asking for help, but last year there were 18,512 applications for assistance from the rural adjustment scheme. Unlike the Democrats, however, the coalition does not believe in bandaid measures and social welfare measures to continue to support farmers. We believe that viability should be restored to an industry which was strong, and will be strong in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Garnaut report noted, for example, that the lower the cost and the more effective the processes that transfer ownership of wool from the farm and through each stage in the processing change, the more wool that will be sold at higher returns to growers. I wish to raise some concerns about the areas in which it is possible to lower costs and therefore to make wool growing a more viable occupation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note and strongly condemn the January fuel tax increase which the Democrats voted for and which will necessarily increase the cost of transport. Indeed, every 1c increase in the fuel excise will cost the farming sector $26.8 million. Transport is a major cost factor for agriculture, accounting for about one-tenth of the value of agricultural production. On average, for every dollar of agricultural output, 7.3c is expended on road transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The level of taxes and charges paid by truck operators in Australia is markedly higher than those in Canada and the United States. Taxes and charges on semi-trailers are 27c per kilometre in Australia, 17c per kilometre in Canada and 10c per kilometre in the USA. Cutting taxes on transport would make Australia far more competitive in comparable world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool committee report also noted the importance of continued improvements in the efficiency of the waterfront, and of the translation of improved port efficiency into lower port and shipping charges. Again, Australian ports lag sadly behind the world's best ports having regard to the cost of services provided by governments and port authorities. In Melbourne, government and port authority charges per container are $142, compared with $35 in Wellington and $18 in Rotterdam. Off-farm costs can be reduced by achieving world competitive waterfront operations. Although this is not the time to have a prolonged discussion of these aspects, I urge the government to realise the effects that further punitive taxes will have on one of our major industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the role of the CSIRO and ask that the funding crisis presently under question be resolved as soon as possible. The Division of Wool Technology must be retained. The wool industry is still our second biggest agricultural exporter and we are still a world pace setter in wool research and development. If we, as the world's leading wool exporter, do not generate the research needed to preserve wool's tenuous four per cent share of global apparel fibre use, we will only have ourselves to blame. If and when that share is eroded by more progressive competitors, again, we will only have ourselves to blame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If wool ceases to be innovative as an apparel fibre, it will soon be left behind by the research-committed cotton industry and the big spending synthetic fibre giants. If tight-fisted funding policies are retained by the government, such an attitude is intolerable in a country where government never stops telling us about the need to add value to our wool export commodities and to make Australia the clever country. I say to Minister Schacht: the ball is in his court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would now like to mention some of the particularly important value-adding innovations launched in recent years, because ultimately these will make wool a far more competitive fibre in the world apparel scene. For instance, two weeks ago, we had the launch of a commodity called `soft wool', which is a new range of wool. It has been subjected to a softening and shrinkage resistant treatment, adapted and perfected by the Australian wool research and promotion organisation, together with Riverina Wool Combing. It is similar to a process called `soft lustre' developed by the International Wool Secretariat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The soft wool treatment makes the fibre softer to touch and much more resistant to pilling. The garments are also machine washable. It is a major change of direction for wool knitwear. It is a wonderful opportunity to capture a part of the key consumer market with a high disposable income, such as the 15- to 25-year-olds. It also has the quality of comfort next to the skin and does not itch or irritate. Lots of skivvy-type garments could be made to wear as inner wear as well as outer wear. It is innovations like these which are making the wool garment industry a lot more adaptable than it has ever been. I urge Minister Schacht to keep funding the Division of Wool Technology and other divisions of the CSIRO that deal with wool so that wool can keep its market share. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wool contained in the stockpile is still healthy. A detailed, two-year examination of the most important aspects of wool held in the stockpile has shown that there has been little or no deterioration. I hope that it can be held for a lot longer yet so as to ultimately be put onto the market. Other innovations such as the new processing technique of low temperature dyeing&mdash;in the sense of changing the colour of wool&mdash;have meant that wool can be dyed faster and at a lower temperature; and this does not damage the wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also seen such innovations as wool replacing other products in housing insulation. Wool is a better thermal insulator under typical weather conditions than other insulating materials; so there is another market. Other products that I have seen showing new and better uses for wool include many products promoted by small-scale or cottage industries; that is, doonas and pillows made out of wool, sportswear made out of wool and wool blend materials&mdash;again this is aimed at younger age groups&mdash;and easy-care fabrics. This means that many more people can buy wool which can be put in the washing machine instead of having to be hand washed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Land care and environmental movements can take advantage of the added volume of wool for seed beds and garden mulch in this era of environmental change. All of these are products of inventive Australians of a later generation than that which produced the Hill's hoist and Sarich's orbital engine, but I would hope that inventions such as these will prove the adaptability of people who look at new ways of using wool in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since my marriage into a farming family I have been proud to be part of Australia's wool industry. I look forward to its growth into a glorious future as it continues to make a major contribution to Australia's economy. In my inaugural speech in this place some seven months ago I spoke of the way in which wool marketing and wool promotion must lie with the private sector. As I look back on those remarks from the vantage point of seven months in this place, and look at the developments of the wool industry that have taken place since then, I do not resile in the slightest from those remarks. But I would also note that in that speech I mentioned the importance of government incentives directed towards the improvement of production technology, and that also is a point of view which I have not changed. I look forward to the wool industry, which we celebrate today, remaining a centrepiece of Australian industry and export development. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today is the beginning of National Wool Week. Appropriately, this morning I moved to refer the rural adjustment scheme and rural debt to the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. The three terms of reference for inquiry by the committee are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the adequacy of the Rural Adjustment Scheme . . . in meeting the present and future needs of primary producers suffering from prolonged adverse circumstances beyond their control;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the extent of rural debt, the nature and serviceability of that debt and its social, economic and ecological consequences; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">what mechanisms should be recommended for the management of rural reconstruction and the contributing roles of government, the financial sector and industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This inquiry will have particular relevance for the wool industry, which has been beset by years of high interest rates, low commodity prices following the collapse of the reserve price scheme and, in Queensland and northern New South Wales, devastating drought. I urge all rural industries, communities, chambers of commerce, shire councils, producer organisations, drought relief committees, churches and charitable organisations to make submissions to this inquiry. This is their opportunity to go direct to parliament to expose the difficulties rural Australians are facing in their struggle for survival. This is a unique opportunity for the national parliament to take stock of our rural industries and to assess the resources and constraints acting on rural Australia as it approaches the 21st century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now governments are looking at the Hilmer review, at regional development, at unemployment and at federalism itself. I urge rural Australians to jump onto the federation centenary train, to make their presence felt, to remind Australia of their great contribution to her development and the stability a healthy rural sector promises for all our futures. Rural Australia, particularly the wool industry, needs to know that the national parliament is committed to a prosperous future for inland Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rural adjustment scheme has failed to keep pace with the prolonged adverse circumstances beyond the control of many farmers. Today RAS is faced with the question of not only how farmers are to survive the next few years but also how they can get back to fulfilling their operating capacity and their export generating destiny. Many parts of rural Australia are very run down. Livestock, machinery and capital improvements have all gone by the wayside as woolgrowers in particular have struggled just to survive. There is no time to go into every aspect of the rural adjustment scheme; neither is it a simple or straightforward scheme&mdash;the guidelines have changed several times over the last few years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of RAS 1992 and 1993 saw a major change that very effectively restricted eligibility for assistance. In the first six months of 1993 there were only 519 approvals for RAS interest subsidies, at a cost of $6,304,000 compared with the previous financial year's total of $68,064,000. In September 1992 there were 15,000 farmers on RAS; 6,000 to 7,000 farmers were expected to finish their RAS contracts that year, according to the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy. This was in the middle of the drought, with the lowest possible wool prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government does not know what has happened to those farmers; it does not monitor the affairs of farmers after they leave RAS. The government made much of its wool package in April 1993. Out of the nation's 60,000 woolgrowers, 5,790 were targeted for exceptional circumstances funding. As at 31 December 1993, 1,367 applicants have been approved, 560 from New South Wales and 214 from Queensland. Something is wrong. The RAS advisory council has twice considered and refuted submissions from the state government to relax the requirement that, to be eligible, 65 per cent of farmers' income is to come from wool. It wants it to be relaxed to 50 per cent. Because of the negative cash incomes, many producers try to get off-farm work, which quickly erodes the percentage of income from wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The much flouted $50.6 million wool package has only maintained the total level of RAS funding to around the same as the previous year at a time when the wool industry and drought-stricken producers in general were really struggling. In addition, the government is recycling $12,674,000 from expected savings from the wool exceptional circumstances fund and from normal RAS funding into forward estimates. Anyone would think that the wool industry was doing very nicely thank you. I seek leave to table some supporting documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One document is a standard budget for an average sheep property used by financial counsellors at Charleville. It shows that even if an average property with an average debt was meeting the interest component of the core debt with the wool market indicator at 650c&mdash;it is not there, and it is a long way from there&mdash;there would be a cash deficit of nearly $20,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second document is a summary of the characteristics of a representative property in south-west Queensland showing the deterioration of its financial position over the last five years. At June 1988 the average debt was $144,254. By February 1994 it was $364,500. Average equity has dropped from 85 per cent to 54 per cent. Seventy-one per cent of properties today have less than 70 per cent equity, which means they are at considerable risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, the ABARE farm survey report of 1993 states that 41 per cent of sheep enterprises are forecast to have a negative farm cash income for 1992-93; 44 per cent had a negative farm cash income in 1991-92. Sheep industry farms are forecast to make an average loss at full equity which, when expressed as a percentage of operating capital, represents a negative rate of return averaging 2.7 per cent. ABARE says that nine per cent of the sheep industry made a positive farm business profit in 1991-92, and 12 per cent in 1992-93. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A survey report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Things are Crook in the Bush</EMPHASIS>, conducted by the Careforce committee in Longreach with the assistance of the DPI and ABC radio, gives some idea of how people are coping. It should be noted that this area has a lot of cattle properties which are not suffering from low wool prices. The highlights of the survey include the following points: 45 per cent were living off overdraft facilities; 27 per cent were living off savings or off-farm investments; 10 per cent were living off both categories; 35 per cent were earning off-farm income and only a quarter of respondents were solely reliant on current property income; 41 per cent of properties were carting water and 44 per cent were hand-feeding stock. The report also states that only eight per cent of respondents were receiving any farm household support or jobsearch allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government originally expected 1,400 to take up farm household support in its first year of operation. Eleven months later there were 388 families on household support, and as at 11 February 1994, there were 376 farmers on farm household support.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Crean boasted of the income support available to farmers. But people do not take farm household support unless they are leaving the land. It comes with too many strings attached. After nine months it is a loan, and must be paid back&mdash;another loan on top of an ever-increasing debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Are woolgrowers, despite the years of negative incomes, somehow doing too well to qualify for this farm household support? There were 83 families in Queensland and the Northern Territory on farm household support last month. Yet in December last year there were 1,000 families depending on food parcels in south-west Queensland alone. The government loosely estimates that between 4,000 and 4,500 farmers or farmers' wives receive some JSA. Yet we know from the Queensland DPI submission to the RAS advisory council the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Social security JSA is not available to most families due to complex eligibility criteria and extended assessment processes, whilst other income support measures are seen widely as additional debt.</PARA>
<PARA>The disadvantage with the jobsearch allowance, if they are lucky enough to meet the stringent assets test of $160,000, is that after they have been on it for nine months they can no longer qualify for re-establishment grants. This is causing great anguish because families are going off JSA and living on nothing, just to keep their options open. The Careforce committee concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is an overwhelming uncertainty about the future, particularly in the next 18 months to two years, which could see many people leave the land without future prospects.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the government's estimates about the need for and eligibility for RAS have been way off the mark. It does not know what is happening out there, and that is why a Senate inquiry is necessary to establish the true position. God forbid that the prediction of the Warrego-Paroo catchment committee should materialise; that if producers are not assisted and wool prices remain under 600c, up to 50 per cent of woolgrowers who cannot diversify in the pastoral regions will be forced to sell out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The desperate straits of many woolgrowers over a number of years must be set against the backdrop of millions of RAS funds not spent but held in state reserves. This year the states will contribute $103.8 million in RAS reserves to the RAS budget. Note 9 to the RAS 1992-93 accounts shows that the interest received by the states from deposits totals $7,769,041. What must an efficient wool producer think? He has cashed in his super; he cannot get RAS or JSA; he has pulled his kids out of school; he has laid workers off; and he hand-feeds the stock he has not shot. What does he think when he sees $103 million of RAS funds get recycled into the next year's RAS budget, on top of the $12.674 million savings not spent from the exceptional circumstances package?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What a merry-go-round! The government promises funds and gets lots of media; the farmers cannot prove eligibility, so the government promises the same funds the next year, with more media, but the farmers still cannot prove they are eligible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many areas of RAS that warrant greater inspection. The other evening in estimates the minister admitted that there are now potentially ten cases where supposedly inalienable re-establishment grants are being claimed by creditors. A week previously there were only two. What is the purpose of having a re-establishment grant, after people have gone through the pain of losing everything, when they have to go through it all over again in the courts?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have also been waiting for a month now for some simple answers to a question asked in estimates on why the South Australian loans to the Commonwealth under RAS were arranged to be waived annually from July 1989, coincidentally just months before the state election prior to the exposing of the disastrous financial situation. They arrived in my office a only half an hour ago. They show that the total face value waived was $58.8 million. That has to be further pursued. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The future holds its own particular challenges to woolgrowers. How do they get their properties back into gear, re-stock, update their old equipment, climb back to peak efficiency and take steps to prevent further land degradation? It all requires capital investment on top of meeting current commitments. Yet forward estimates for RAS show a dramatic drop in assistance from $170 million this year to $92 million next year. This is very dangerous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exceptional circumstances funding finishes on 30 June this year. Unless it is extended, all the money spent to date will have been wasted. The process of recovery must be allowed for, and must be allowed to go ahead. The management of debt is a prerequisite for the healthy survival of large proportions of our sheep, beef and grain properties. At present, rural debt is thrown around like a hot potato between banks and governments and always ends up in the farmers' hands, where it is increasingly being dropped, which is not helpful to anyone.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The December 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Agriculture and Resources Quarterly</EMPHASIS> shows that in 1988 total farm debt was $10.76 billion. By 1993 this had risen to $15.74 billion&mdash;a 50 per cent jump in five years&mdash;while loan serviceability has nosedived and asset values have fallen. In his address to the Rural Australia 2000 Conference in Toowoomba last December, Dr Mark McGovern stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In real terms, over the last decade, gross farm produce has not kept up with national performance; aggregate farm unincorporated enterprise household receipts have halved while total farm indebtedness has grown by 50 per cent while the real net value of farm returns has fluctuated markedly&mdash;at no time being above the level in 1980-81. If forecasts for the current year are included, over the last 44 years, 9 of the 10 lowest levels of real net value occurred in the last decade.</PARA>
<PARA>Debt is not of itself necessarily a limiting factor. As Dr Peterson from ABARE presented to the Outlook Conference, the optimal level of farm debt is related to many factors. Where farmers expect net returns from borrowing, a higher leverage should increase returns to equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of Australian farmers are finding that their borrowings, far from increasing net returns, are dragging them down. They do not have the funds to service the debt, run their operations and meet household expenses. The debt grows larger and becomes less serviceable as interest rates, drought or other seasonal conditions work against them and low commodity prices bleed their cash flows. As and when conditions improve, farmers will need capital to build up stock levels, boost productivity and take preventative steps against future droughts and environmental degradation. If the government believes its own rhetoric about all the benefits to be gained by Australian farmers under GATT, it had better make sure that there are plenty of farmers left to make the most of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the documents that I have tabled contains results of a survey of the Queensland Graingrowers Association. Its President, Ian McFarlane, says that it will take a succession of good crops over the next five years for many Queensland graingrowers to return to viability. Senator Lees told the Senate recently that one-third of South Australian farmers live on or below the poverty line. The South Australian premier has announced an inquiry into rural debt. He said that there is no doubt that debt is the single biggest problem facing our rural communities.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another document I tabled contains some illuminating findings contained in the Queensland government's November 1993 submission to RASAC for extensions of RAS's exceptional circumstances, chief among them being that the drought has caused a great loss of some $3,396 million to the Queensland economy over the last two years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPI concludes that there has been a marked deterioration in equity levels of all primary producers. Life in rural Australia is a house of cards. Rural equity underpins the survival of towns. The Professor of Agricultural Economics at the University of Queensland, John Longworth, has said that perhaps as much as 25 per cent of the Australian work force is employed in occupations dependent on agriculture. The link between economic and ecological sustainability is very strong in the bush, especially in drought areas. Pastoralists are simply not able to implement Landcare programs while their enterprises are financially insecure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dimension of the financial problems in the rural sector is hopelessly mismatched with RAS resources and other schemes. ABARE, industry groups, finance counsellors and the Queensland DPI all agree on the widespread existence of negative farm incomes over several years. RAS interest subsidies for exceptional circumstances are aimed at but do not reach one-third of industry specialists. The rest are struggling along on their own with devastating effects on their families, their health and their future viability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Queensland Farmers Federation said, a market driven reconstruction where a large percentage of producers were forced to leave the industry would be chaotic, damaging and destabilising. It can be avoided only by government, banks and industry uniting to manage industry reconstruction. At the rural Australia conference in Toowoomba last year, rural debt emerged as the overriding problem. In the federation's press release after the conference, it called for a Senate inquiry into rural debt. The National and Liberal parties agreed that the erosion of rural equity is such that it warrants a thorough investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rural adjustment is not just an economic issue; it contains social and moral imperatives. The pressure is on out there&mdash;really on. Reviews of RAS are going on now and families are being advised that they are being processed out of RAS. They will join the large rural army marching on hope alone. It is no longer heroic. It is getting damned dangerous. Charitable organisations have done all they can, but it is only government, in association with lending institutions, which can restore some order, which can investigate some mechanisms for managing rural debt and, in the process, revive hope and commitment to inland Australia. </PARA>

Because a person does not wear a tweed sports coat, oilskin trousers, elastic-sided boots and an Akubra hat, does not mean he or she is not a woolgrower.

In other words, 97 years of gold production in Australia was worth less than the Australian woolclip.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the disaster of the late 1980s demand for wool had risen, production rose out of control&mdash;not that I believe in trying to control production&mdash;there was no reserve price scheme so nothing took into consideration the value of the Australian dollar and production took off. The industry had a certain greed. It was quite happy to accept the recommendation by the Wool Council of Australia that the government set a reserve price of 900c a kilo or thereabouts. The government at the time and Mr Kerin, as the then minister responsible for primary industry, accepted that recommendation. Of course, that situation could not have lasted forever and there was a total collapse in prices. Overproduction followed Mr Kerin's ironclad guarantee overseas that that reserve price scheme would not be taken away. When reality hit, the scheme collapsed and the rest is history. The prices collapsed completely. The reserve price went below 400c a kilo clean. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of trial and error in trying to turn the market around since that time. Fortunately&mdash;probably on the third go&mdash;a new marketing scheme was set up and put into place by the previous minister for primary industry, Mr Crean. That scheme is only starting to come into play now. The minister's main change was from a fixed debt reduction scheme to a fixed wool stockpile reduction scheme. I give Mr Crean some credit for that, even though I did not give him much credit when he first became responsible for that portfolio. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought our new farmer's friend, Senator Collins, might have taken part in this debate this afternoon. I thought he might have been in the chamber, listening and making a contribution. I think, in time, Senator Collins might even make a contribution to primary industry, as he tells me he is the farmer's friend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there have been various changes. We now have the fixed wool stockpile reduction scheme. It was supposed to begin on 1 November 1993 with $24,800 bales per month. But, with the price being so weak at the time, it was impractical to carry on along that line. The reduction of the stockpile was put off and a trial parcel was put into some auction sales for a few weeks. I understand that has been reasonably successful. On 1 July 1994 the reduction will be 187,000 bales per quarter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe in this new scheme to reduce the stockpile because it is a very transparent scheme. The growers and the trade can forecast what will come off the sheep's back when they look at the sort of season they have had and the sort of production there has been. What is coming out of the stockpile is very transparent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then there is the good scheme where, if the demand takes more out of the stockpile than those 187,000 bales per quarter&mdash;that is multiplied by four for one year, of course; Senator Boswell might work that one out in his head, but it is just below 800,000 bales&mdash;corporations can buy back in. I agree with that. We will keep a certain demand and supply. Of course, if a corporation buys back in it refreshes the stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator Troeth say that there would be no damage to the stockpile, but from my information there could be a certain amount of damage. If older wool goes out and newer wool comes in the stockpile will freshen up. I agree with that and look forward to seeing how it will work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, we are a long way from being able to say that woolgrowers are out of the wood, or out of trouble. The other day when we were talking about presenting this motion to the parliament, one of my colleagues said, `But the price of wool has gone up'. It certainly has, but it is nowhere near being in a viable situation. At present the national wool indicator stands at 564c a kilo, but it was below 400c a kilo in November of 1992, if I have the right month. It has improved slightly since then, and we are probably at a higher rate now than has been forecast for some time. But it is hardly at a rate high enough to cover the costs of production. I can see a future in wool. The price of wool will gradually rise, as it has always done in other depression years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the price has to reach 750c a kilo, otherwise it will only be a holding situation. When woolgrowers reach that point, two issues have to be addressed. The most important issue that has to be addressed&mdash;it has been mentioned by previous speakers&mdash;is to retire debt. Mr Keating said the other day that, with the improvement in the business sector as a whole, business people and companies now have to start investing or there will be other news for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and he is getting out of the pig farm, I hear. How can he say that? When business turns around&mdash;there have been depressive years in all industry, let alone wool&mdash;a certain debt accumulates. Senator Boswell pointed out the situation of the woolgrowers' debt. When there is a turnaround&mdash;I can see it is going to be at least another three years&mdash;retiring a debt will be the first major important factor to take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When farmers are in a better situation, farm maintenance and improvement will have to be looked at again. If we go around the rural and remote areas of Australia, as I do, we can see by driving down the country roads the state of disrepair of the fences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important issue pointed out by Senator Troeth  concerns landcare. I know from figures on grazing areas as against cropping areas that there has been a minimal application of fertiliser over those years. I believe that a price of around 750c a kilo has to be achieved before the debt load can be reduced and more spending occurs on the farm. If his family wants to take it on, a woolgrower can pass a well set up and productive farm on to his children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we ever reach that 750c a kilo, the future will be controlled by two points: production and demand. Production is stabilising, and it has been stabilising for quite a while. Certainly since the disastrous happenings in 1989, 1990 and 1991 production in Australia has been going down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the main reasons why production has gone down is because the fringe growers have disappeared again. By fringe growers I mean those woolgrowers who came in, say, from the cattle industry and from the higher rainfall grain industry areas. When wool reached a guaranteed minimum price of 870c a kilo, they moved into wool growing. When it collapsed, they moved out as fast as they came in. The result was that they took those higher prices and left the debt of the stockpile, which was some four million bales&mdash;a record debt. That has been left for the present growers to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some woolgrowers were forced out by massive debts. I suppose we could say that most of that slack caused by the woolgrowers who left was taken up by others who bought their farms, provided that they continued to grow wool on those farms that they had taken over. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably the hardest hit area in the downturn of the last three or four years has been the pastoral area. In the agricultural areas, and in the higher rainfall cattle areas people who had gone into wool were able to go back to cattle and grain. It was easy to change over. But certain pastoral areas can run only sheep; they cannot run cattle. It is very hard to change over from one to the other, and they were locked in. They are the ones who have probably suffered the most. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the demand side. We had an economic downturn in western Europe, and in central Europe because of the breakdown of the central government. We also had a downturn in Japan. The world demand for wool has decreased along with the world economic situation in the last three-odd years. If those countries return to strong economies, I believe that the demand for wool will increase again in the next two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to countries that have been great customers of Australian fine wool. Italy was a good customer, but its economy has gone down. Perhaps things will improve in Italy after the election next weekend. In Germany and France the economy has gone down. Japan's economy has been declining. They all declined in 1993. The odd one out is the United Kingdom, which seems to have got over the worst of the slump in the economy and is now returning to greater strength. The demand for Australian wool in the United Kingdom has increased in the last few months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fashion is the other factor relating to demand on wool. Whether we like it or not, fashion dictates what people wear. It is not only women's fashion but men's fashion as well, and it is big factor in how much wool is consumed. The average demand per person in western Europe, Japan and the United States in recent years has been for about 2.2 kilos, but that average has now gone down. Hopefully, it will return. Fashion, and how much wool is used, has a great bearing on the market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was speaking to an Italian industrialist, who is based in Sydney for the next three years and who is taking over three or four Australian woollen mills and probably turning them into one, and he mentioned the change in people's clothing because of the cars that they drive&mdash;I hardly believed this at the time&mdash;particularly with the advent of four-wheel drive vehicles. Not only in Australia but elsewhere people are driving vehicles like the Toyota Landcruiser GLX, or whatever it is called. Canada and the United States are full of these four-wheel drive vehicles. They are called RVs over there, which stands for recreation vehicles. Europe is the same. Even people in Greece, where my friend on the other side of the chamber has his roots, use four-wheel drive vehicles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will discuss that at another time. I think he must have had a four-wheel vehicle at some stage. This industrialist was telling me that people driving those cars instead of vehicles such as Mercedes or, say, Holdens wear different clothes. This different clothing requires material other than wool. I was very surprised to hear that. So fashion dictates the fabrics used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union they are moving from a central market to a free market or market-based situation. The demand for wool in those countries has virtually dropped to zero whereas in the 1980s they took 10 to 20 per cent of our wool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I visited Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Bulgaria three years ago and looked at their wool industry. I looked at what they were buying and manufacturing from Australia. Unfortunately, their mills are very run-down and will have to be looked to in future so that they can produce and sell products to eastern Europe or back into western Europe. A lot of money has to be spent on these mills to get them to the required standard. To get a demand in those countries will take a long time but I believe it will come. China is in the same situation. It is taking far less wool from us than it used to but hopefully demand will improve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We, in this place, tend to think that Australia is virtually the only wool producer in the world. I used to think that Australia grew most of the wool. It grows 80 per cent of the world's marketable wool, not of the world's wool. China, to my knowledge, grows more wool than Australia does, but it is all woven and used on the farms, so it does not get onto the world market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two countries in the world are vastly expanding their wool production and they produce pretty good wool. One is Uruguay and the other is New Zealand. Those countries will have a great bearing on the world wool price in the future. Argentina has been a good producer of fine wool, helped very much by the Australian merino that was imported when the embargo on their export from Australia was lifted. The debate about the merino embargo is for another day. Argentina's production has gone down markedly in the last couple of years. But that was caused by a volcano disaster that wiped out a lot of its stock and the fact that it is replacing its sheep with cattle because of the foot and mouth disease problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there are a lot of factors that will have a bearing on wool prices that we can expect to receive. I believe there is a future for wool in Australia, because up until about four years ago Australia was producing and exporting $6 billion worth of wool. We are still producing and exporting $3 billion worth of wool. That figure is still greater than for gold production to this stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Troeth mentioned that a lot of wool is used for insulation. It makes good insulation in houses. The point I make is that if wool is cheap enough to use for insulation in houses then it is not worth growing. I admire those manufacturers of insulation made from wool but when wool returns to 750 kilograms, which I believe is necessary for the industry to survive, I believe that product will be priced out of that market. I believe in wool being used as fibre in the clothing and allied industries. It must retain a certain price to keep it in those industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I can see a future for wool and I know that Australian producers and the people that rely on their income, such as the shearers, the local stores and the stockhouses of Australia, have had a bad time in the past. I can see a future and I hope that it will not be too many years before wool gets back to its previous position of earning Australia's export income.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is one small matter that I would like to add before we move to the conclusion of this debate. Senator Harradine raised concerns about the treatment of housekeeping payments from husband to wife when the wife is at home caring for a child and, therefore, potentially qualifies for the home child-care allowance. Senator Harradine's concern is that periodic housekeeping payments are income for the purposes of assessing the rate of HCCA payment to the wife. The advice I have is that on a strict legal reading of the provisions of the Social Security (Home Child Care and Partner Allowances) Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 and the Social Security Act 1991 Senator Harradine's concerns may be justified. However, there was never any intention to administer the home child-care allowance income test in such a way that periodic housekeeping payments made from one spouse to the other would be taken into account as income of the recipient for the purposes of applying the HCCA income test. I assure the Senate that the HCCA income test will not be administered in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So as to allay any concerns that Senator Harradine may have, the government undertakes to further consider the legal aspect of this matter with a view to determining whether the act needs to be amended to specifically exclude housekeeping payments&mdash;that is, housekeeping payments from husband to wife, or wife to husband&mdash;from the definition of income for the HCCA purposes. If amendments prove to be necessary, the government will move the necessary amendments in the winter sittings. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, a Keating Government will increase the dependent spouse rebate and pay it directly to the spouse at home caring for children. The new Home Child Care Allowance will be $30 a week and will provide some source of independent income for women at home caring full time for children.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no mention that families with students in full-time education would be excluded. There is no mention that families who are temporarily overseas would be excluded. There is no mention that families with students receiving Austudy would be excluded. There is no mention that families would be excluded as a result of the more onerous social security income definitions. The promise was cut and dried: the dependent spouse rebate would be increased and paid directly to the spouse at home caring for children. As I said before, this is not the first promise the government has broken since the election, and I guess it will not be the last. It does not mean that the Senate should not insist that the government keeps the promises it made to the Australian public prior to the last federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition's amendment to the motion before the Senate seeks to give the government a final chance to abide by its pre-election promise to Australian families. It points out that the government's bill, in its current form, will exclude certain families from the home child-care allowance. It outlines the ongoing efforts that have been made by the coalition, Senator Harradine and the Greens to overcome this unacceptable anomaly&mdash;I do not know whether it is an anomaly but it is disadvantaging those families. An anomaly seems to indicate that it may be an oversight; but I do not think it is an oversight on the government's part, I think it is absolutely deliberate. The amendment puts on the public record the fact that the drafting of amendments to overcome this problem is complex. It puts forward a possible method of overcoming the problems which would, at the same time, minimise unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Agreeing not to press the original request for amendments expresses the fact that the Senate in no way wants to put at risk the benefits contained in this bill. I have said that and I keep repeating it because the minister keeps putting out press releases saying that we are putting it at risk. As I said earlier, and I think Senator Crowley mentioned it, it refers to the relevant precedent which was set when Senator McMullan gave an undertaking in March 1994 that the government would give effect to the Senate's intentions by redrafting the amendment. Senator Crowley said that was because the government agreed with it. I do not think Senator Crowley has given me or Senator Harradine&mdash;and we have asked her a number of times&mdash;adequate reasons why she is failing to include families who would have been eligible and who have now become ineligible under the Social Security Act, as opposed to having the benefit under the tax regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment to the motion sends a very clear message to the government. It is telling the government that while the Senate will not jeopardise the benefits of the home child-care allowance, it believes that families who are in receipt of the with child dependent spouse rebate should be eligible for the home child-care allowance as was promised before the election.In the interim, since we have been debating this bill, we have had, again, the same old tactics that we are used to. What is the excuse now about this amendment? It is that if we pass this amendment as it is, we will not have time to get the bill back from the House of Representatives and this whole thing will be put in jeopardy because the start-up date is September. The same old tactics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government has a bill in the Senate, and it wants amendments to get through and it is the last sitting day, it sure as anything can get that bill to the House of Representatives. The government can have the House of Representatives waiting around and it can bring the bill back&mdash;it can do anything when it suits. But we are told that if we press this amendment and it is agreed to, we will jeopardise this bill because it may not get back from the House of Representatives and then we will not have time&mdash;poor things&mdash;to get the bill up and running. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is absolute bunkum. But I will not allow the minister, or Minister Baldwin, to waltz around the country accusing the opposition of putting this at risk. I will put it on the public record that we have given the government three opportunities&mdash;and this was a fourth opportunity&mdash;to do something about those families. I do not know how the minister can sit there, knowing that young families are working in care organisations but they will not be eligible for this. I just find it unbelievable. But so be it. When I go around Monash and the other universities, I will remind all of the young academics that the minister said today that she does not care about them&mdash;it is of no interest to her!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We could be accused of caving in to political blackmail. However, I am not prepared to jeopardise the 840,000 families that will be eligible for HACCA for the simple sake of trying to beat my head against a wall. We have a government that will not listen and has no compassion for these families. So I will be withdrawing my motion, but I will say on the public record that I had every intention of pushing ahead with it. I am sure that I would have had the support of the people who supported me before. But the government is about blackmail&mdash;`If you do this, this bill will be jeopardised'.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley) for providing an answer in respect of the matter that I raised; that is to say, the definition of income and how that affects the eligibility of persons to receive HACCA. The minister indicated that there was never any intention to administer HACCA income tests in such a way that periodical housekeeping payments made from one spouse to the other would be taken into account as income of the recipient. The minister also assured the chamber that the HACCA income test will not be administered in this way. Clearly, that is obviously not sufficient. We need to ensure the legislation is accurate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that the minister has undertaken on behalf of the government to further consider the legal aspects of the matter with a view to determining whether the act needs to be amended to specifically exclude housekeeping payments from the definition of income for HACCA purposes. I would hope that the government would exclude all of those items that are now excluded under the taxation legislation, because that is probably what the minister means; in other words, that persons are not disadvantaged on the basis of an income test for HACCA as compared with the DSR. I will leave that to one side. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister why the House of Representatives, at the behest of the government&mdash;opposed by the opposition&mdash;decided to penalise a number of families who are currently in receipt of the with-child income test by $237 a year, plus the additional amount that is provided for under this HACCA bill. These people will be penalised by between $300 and $400 a year, $237 of which will be immediately cut. I honestly ask the minister how she can justify cutting the income of a family of the type that has been mentioned by Senator Patterson and referred to in her amendment which has now been withdrawn. How can we justify that? It is a difficult situation and I am almost positive that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) does not know about this. He was the one who gave the undertaking to the electorate prior to the last election. I wonder why the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) has taken this step and pushed it onto the parliament. </PARA>

So that distinction is to be made, but it is a matter of some $400-plus per annum. It is not as though they are not eligible for the dependent spouse rebate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hopefully someone is giving me one of those running sheets as well. I came in here slightly more speedily than I expected, and I am not even sure whether the running sheet that is prepared now is the same as the one I was given the other day. I would like to make a couple of preliminary remarks about the conduct of this bill, and the good and bad things that we can see by the way different bills are handled. As most senators will know, this bill was sent off to the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. A number of people, expert in their field, were invited to come and give evidence as to their views on the bill and what amendments ought to be made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know if in the first instance the Democrats spotted what I think was&mdash;hopefully we will be able to say was&mdash;one of the key problems with the bill. It was not clear that they spotted it when it went through the Legislative Scrutiny Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills, and we did not spot it. I do not know whether the government even thought it was a problem. I refer to the changes to the law in relation to accused persons taking part in identification parades. Through some negotiations the government has agreed to ditch its proposed changes in that respect and maintain the existing common law position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of having the bill looked at in committee and enabling people to raise a variety of concerns and to focus on the consequences, and to argue out in places other than this chamber the benefits or otherwise of the proposed changes, was a very beneficial one. It was beneficial because initially the government said, `Okay. This might be a bit rough if a jury can draw a negative inference because of someone's refusal to participate in an identification parade other than for good reason. We understand that'. I do not say that the government said that willingly, but in the end it did say that. In the end it said, `We will give someone legal advice. We will make sure they have got a lawyer there', to which I would say&mdash;and I think the Democrats would agree&mdash;`A fat lot of use that is'. All that does is allow someone to spell out in clear terms to someone else what jeopardy they would be in if they did not participate in this parade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what was seen to be a solution was no solution at all. Having a lawyer there would mean that the lawyer would just tell a person what the law was, and the law was that that person would be in deep trouble. It was, in effect, going to be an attack, albeit a small one, on the principle that an innocent person can sit there and do nothing. The person would not be found guilty because the Crown will not be able to get enough evidence against that person. That principle really means that a person should not have to do things, if they are innocent, to maintain their liberty. But if a negative inference is allowed to be drawn from a person's refusal to participate in an identification parade, that person would be tempted&mdash;foolish one would say, if that person looked like other suspects&mdash;not to participate in that parade if a negative inference could be drawn because the person had done so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand the arguments about the Crown needing the most reliable identification. All of that follows. The point being made by a number of people, and supported by us, is that one cannot always approach these things from the point of view of the difficulty in proving guilt. Every now and then for the sake of sanity one has to say, `What about the arguments that one is innocent until proven guilty? What can we do to maintain that situation?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this instance, I believe that if an inference is drawn that one is not participating for other than a good reason, that is an attack on one's right as an innocent citizen to do nothing and fear nothing. There could be arguments as to what is `a good reason'. Some of the witnesses before the committee said, `Well, you might think a good reason is that you didn't look too flash'. A person might have had a hard night out and not gone home and shaved&mdash;I am assuming that crooks are men; the statistics might support that, as more often than not they are. If one looked dishevelled and was wearing dirty clothes, one might think that one's appearance would carry with it the look of a suspicious character. At the time that might be thought of as a good enough reason to refuse to participate. But, someone else&mdash;a jury or a judge; whoever decided whether it was a good enough reason&mdash;might think that person was just shifty and wanted to go home and spruce up his appearance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If someone who is a thug and a crook&mdash;and looks like a thug and a crook&mdash;is caught bashing up someone in a back street, and then appears in court in a suit, shirt and tie and with neatly cut hair and a clean shaven face, people will often say it is a ruse to make him appear other than what he is&mdash;namely, a thug and a crook. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That simple example of, `I don't want to participate because I don't look too flash' might be perfectly reasonable to some people and a bit suspicious to others. I am very pleased that the government will not proceed in the way it originally intended and has agreed that on that matter at least the common law, as it now stands, should apply. I trust that that is the effect of the amendment and that what we want to achieve is achieved. I hope there is not some technical stuff-up. I suppose that is something the government would now say it is pleased about, but we wonder why it did not take that approach in the first place and why it thought providing a solicitor was any help. All that a solicitor could do would be to point out the jeopardy in which one would find oneself by not participating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if nothing else in the bill is changed&mdash;although other things will be&mdash;that change alone is reason enough to justify the efforts that we put in when we sent these bills off to the committee. I must say that the discussions held were most amicable. Even if it that change were the only one achieved, we would be very happy&mdash;but there is more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of a suggestion of mine, I am bold enough to say, the government is going to move an amendment. It is only small, and most people would look at it and say, `Who gives a tuppence ha'penny damn about that. That will not affect me'. I do not know which number the amendment is, but it is the one that ensures that when property that has been seized comes up for a reassessment about whether the Crown can still keep it, more attempts will now be made than would otherwise have been the case to notify the owners of the property that there will be some sort of hearing as to whether their property can remain seized. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about criminality it is easy to think about guns or cars or whatever, but these days one might be talking about expensive computer equipment which was seized because it had been lent to someone and was in that person's house. It may have had nothing to do with any alleged criminal activity, but one may not be able to get that computer equipment back. It seems only fair that one should be notified of an opportunity to claim that the Crown should no longer keep the property, whatever it is, and that one should be able to get it back. I am very pleased that the government has agreed to make that change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some other changes that the government is making as a consequence of the committee hearing. I am pleased about them as well. There are some more that the Australian Democrats want to make, but which we will not support. That does not mean that, in spirit, there is anything wrong with anything the Democrats want to do. But in the end, on balance it comes down to whether it is an effective way to proceed and whether, in proceeding in that way, they actually achieve something other than making everybody feel better by walking away and saying, `We have changed the legislation here and there'. I am not sure that some of the Democrats' amendments would be very effective in the way they affect people on the ground on a day-to-day basis. I do not believe a case has been adequately made out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to some other amendments with which we also have sympathy, it is a case of saying, `We are talking here about legislation that relates to Commonwealth offences which will primarily be investigated by federal police, but sometimes by state police as well'. The question of what is the law in each of the states comes to mind because there are state police officers who will have to operate with respect to both. The consequences for state governments of changing this need to be borne in mind. We believe in a cooperative federal system, and some of the recommendations contained in the Democrats' amendments may well happen in the end by way of the Attorneys-General getting together and deciding to proceed down that path. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make those preliminary remarks to let it be known how pleased we are about those two particular changes. The first change is very important. The second change is perhaps not so important, but we would all think that unless they were our goods that had been seized, we wanted them back and had not been given the opportunity to participate. We are very pleased about the committee process and the way in which it has operated. We are in sympathy with many of the Democrats' amendments but we, nonetheless, believe they are not going to achieve what they want to achieve or are too onerous. In the end, those changes will come about through a cooperative arrangement with the states. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a real temptation to support these amendments because the spirit of them is well based. For example, it seems reasonable to ask an officer who is applying for a warrant to have to indicate whether he or she expects to make an entry without announcement. That does not seem, on the face of it, unreasonable but, in a practical situation, if that occasions people to make bad decisions because of the written position of their expectation and that expectation having, for quite inexplicable reasons, changed, as it frequently does in these sorts of things, that would be a shame. That is very much the case with firearms. If an officer, however experienced or however young, indicates that firearms were not going to be necessary, but then finds himself or herself in a position where it is believed they are now going to be necessary and pauses for a fraction of a second too long, occasioning not just injury, but possibly loss of life to himself, herself or someone else, it is a bad thing. But, in principle, the notion of their turning their minds to these sorts of matters as they apply for the warrant is a good one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have made a different assessment from the Democrats of the consequences of asking them to not just turn their minds to it but to put it in writing as a record, and as to the apprehension that that then creates when the circumstances change. It also begs the question of who checks up. I know that further Democrat amendments want a reporting back and a checking up. We do not support those amendments. One asks: what is its purpose if it cannot be assessed and judged in some qualitative way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The suggestion that perhaps police do not turn their minds to these things is not offensive. There have been accidents that should not have happened. We do not want to inflame the debate by referring to any of those in particular, but there have been some pretty appalling examples of loss of life with the use of firearms. It encourages one to think, `Well, let's make them always indicate when they expect to use them'. That is asking for a law to be made with respect to all law enforcement officers to deal with the odd occasions rather than the general situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not condone those odd occasions when things go very badly wrong. It is simply that it is not necessarily the basis on which to make a good law. Noting these things will not necessarily achieve anything, but it might in fact achieve a negative because people who have made that decision then pause for just that little bit longer than they should. That could mean loss of life or injury. It could mean ineffectiveness of the warrant because of a failure to make an entry without an announcement when, had that been done, the evidence&mdash;or whatever was being looked for&mdash;could have been obtained. I think they might have a counterproductive effect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I share the sentiments of Senator Vanstone. The principles involved here are laudable, but it is a matter of finding that balance which Senator Spindler mentioned earlier&mdash;the balance between efficacy and the desirability of individual freedom and civil liberty. The motive behind these amendments, if Senator Spindler can forgive me for being so presumptuous as to designate a motive behind his amendments, is that there should be some ability to report back and some trace of how these decisions were arrived at so that, if there is a subsequent investigation, there is evidence by which an investigator can determine whether the proper processes were carried out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More and more throughout Australia we find police forces coming under scrutiny. When there is nothing to scrutinise, when there is no evidence, it is very difficult for anyone to see whether due process has been carried out. That is one aspect of these amendments. Another aspect is that it might cause police officers to reflect in a more sombre and sober fashion, if we can put it that way, as to the exercise of their powers. There are laudable motives behind these amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only concern I have is when it comes to weighing efficacy against principles. As Senator Vanstone mentioned, it might cause problems for some officers in the execution of their duty. If it is to be said that no firearm is to be used or that there is to be entry without an announcement or something of that sort, then they would stop and think, `Well, that wasn't put on the warrant; I will have to think twice about doing it now'. I think it is a valid point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very difficult for police officers to form a prognostication as to a circumstance in search and seizure because generally this occurs in emotive conditions. Most officers would say, `Look, in most cases it is possible that there could have to be entry without announcement'. The matter of firearms is perhaps a little different. It could leave the officers open to too much criticism were they to look at the matter and say, `I don't think firearms are applicable; I don't think entry without announcement is a possibility here. I don't think it is feasible; I don't think it will arise'&mdash;and then of course events turn out completely differently. They find themselves making an entry without announcement and perhaps firearms could even be resorted to. In that case the tables could be turned on the police officers should there be a complaint. I am perhaps taking this aspect to its extreme, but nonetheless it could occur. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From my experience with police officers they complain that a good deal of their work is tied up with paperwork and not with actual law enforcement and law and order. I partially accept that view. They do need to complete paperwork because there has to be due record of their actions and processes. Nonetheless, we do not want a police force which is hidebound with desk work and undue paperwork which keeps it from being on the streets maintaining law and order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put on record my response to some of the remarks made. I should state that the bill now requires the issuing officer to be informed by the officer seeking a warrant whether there is a suspicion that firearms are to be used.

It can go either way. I understand the argument that Senator Spindler raises, but I think that what he is saying does not cover the other situation where a life might be saved by an officer on the spur of the moment very quickly changing his mind, and the statement being on the face of the warrant might well be a disincentive for that. We could argue until the cows come home. There is not a lot in it.

We feel that, while there is a need to ensure that mechanisms exist for the detection and prevention of crime, it is also very important that there be proper monitoring of police activities and that important civil liberties be preserved. One does not require great feats of memory to recall examples of gross police corruption, misuse of power and curtailment of civil liberties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone has a point in that sometimes people do make statements that, without legal advice, they regret and that those statements can be used in some way; nevertheless, people who do not have any record of the arrest or their comments at the time are in far greater danger of having their vulnerability used against them. Anyone who has worked in the criminal justice system knows of the incidences where there are allegations that people have been verballed. When that occurs&mdash;and it occurs again and again&mdash;it is as much in the interests of the police who are making those arrests to have some evidence that they have conducted themselves legitimately and validly as it is for the people who are under scrutiny and are being arrested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that Senator Spindler has put before this committee, including the one that is being considered at this time, should not be merely regarded as an interference in the course of the duties of police.

We believe that the amendments preserve the balance between the detection and prevention of crime and the protection of civil liberties. We find it difficult to see how these amendments could be opposed. </PARA>

It seems sensible to try to keep some sort of commonality as to who can do this. Therefore, it seems appropriate to follow what is in the bill and say, `If you can do it for state legislation, you can do it for the purposes of this legislation'.

We are advised by the government that over 700 federal warrants are issued in New South Wales each year. If the states were not entitled to use these court-appointed authorised JPs who are trained to understand the issues that have to be considered in issuing warrants, this would be quite a substantial imposition on them.

That is about as far as it goes. A consequence of that sort of assessment is that it is the government's position that we are discussing a proposition which is high on paperwork and probably very low on practical utility. For those reasons, we oppose the amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have to be sure that when we ask for a reporting back procedure, someone will actually be looking at it and making a comprehensive assessment over a reasonably long-term basis as to what happens. I am not informed that that is what is happening in New South Wales. I do not agree with Senator Spindler that because New South Wales has that procedure we would be following the states; we would be following a state.

The compensation should be payable as if it were a debt of the Commonwealth.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Democrats will be supporting the message from the House of Representatives and I will give reasons for that. One reason for not proceeding with the coalition's amendment in this case is that the government has argued that to provide the defence community with two representatives is out of proportion to other representation on the committee. Having carefully examined its arguments, we have accepted its point. However, we have insisted on an amendment to make it absolutely clear that the views of the ex-service community will be represented on the commission through the Australian Defence Force member. We believe that this is a reasonable compromise.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition is concerned that a member of the Defence Force cannot possibly represent the interests of former members. It argues that the cases and the needs of former members are different. There are, obviously, differences between serving and former ADF personnel, but they also have a good deal in common. The way to make this arrangement work is to establish a formal consultative process whereby the ADF representative meets regularly with ex-service organisations and undertakes to represent their concerns on the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister will need to be judicious in his choice of an ADF member and must satisfy himself that an adequate consultative process has been established. The government points out that the licensed authorities had only one representative on the commission as do all other Commonwealth departments and authorities. The entire union movement, with many members in the Public Service, is represented by one ACTU officer, and a member of the postal union. That leaves many relevant departments, authorities and unions with no direct representation. They are represented by people whose consultative task is much more onerous than that which the ADF member will have under the government amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is rather unfortunate that the government did not follow its normal practice and make its views known to us in advance of the committee stage. This was despite an approach from us to discuss any amendments which might arise. Various commitments prevented us from monitoring the debate on the amendment. In any case, it is usual for amendments to be negotiated before the committee stage. This situation could have been avoided with better communication. I am not sure of the opposition's reaction. I guess it will accuse us of capitulation. The fact is that we have decided to reach a reasonable compromise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Military Compensation Bill introduces a compensation scheme to meet the special requirements of the ADF. This scheme is, in part, structured around the provisions of the Safety Rehabilitation Compensation Act with modification for Defence Force needs. The government initiated an extensive program of consultation about the new scheme with groups representing both the Defence Force and the veteran communities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues raised during the consultations related to the representation of these communities in the administration of the scheme. So far as the SRCA is concerned, administration is supervised by the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission. To meet the concern raised during the consultations, the government agreed to add a Defence Force representative to the commission. A government amendment was moved for this purpose when the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives in February of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the consideration of the Bill in the Senate on 22 March, an opposition amendment was carried to add a further member of the commission to be nominated by an organisation or organisations representing veterans. The government believes that this further change is inappropriate. The present 10-member composition of the commission has been structured to represent employers, unions, and government, and an additional member to represent the veteran community would be inconsistent with this intention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the amendment for an additional member representing veterans were accepted, it is likely there would be pressure for other organisations or groups to be represented such as, for example, retired public servants. This would not only disturb the existing balance in the commission's membership, but would also increase its size to the point where it would become unwieldy and inefficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With respect to the Defence Force representative, I point out that it needs to be borne in mind that members of the Defence Force are not represented by a registered trade union, and their interests, therefore, are not directly covered by the ACTU members of the commission. The Defence Force representative is also able to enhance the commission's awareness of the nature of defence service&mdash;a matter of particular relevance with the introduction of the military compensation scheme. These factors do not apply with respect to the suggested nominee of veterans' organisations. For these reasons the government does not accept the amendment that was made by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time the government acknowledges that there would be merit in an explicit legislative recognition of the interests of former as well as serving members of the Defence Force in the administration of the SRCA. Accordingly, the government has proposed a reformulation of the provision of the SRCA dealing with the Defence Force member of the commission. It is proposed that there be a further amendment to express this provision in terms that this member of the commission be a member of the Defence Force who, in the minister's opinion, represents the interests of members and former members of the Defence Force. The government believes this recognition of the interests of both groups does meet the concern that arose in the consultative process that I have referred to, but does so in a way that does not alter the balance of the commission or lead to the range of other difficulties that I outlined.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to place on record the fact that the development of the Military Compensation Bill has involved very extensive consultation between my staff, officers of Defence, officers of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and, of course, the Australian Defence Force, representatives of the ex-service community, and serving members of the ADF. I place on record my appreciation of the contribution by all the organisations and individuals who have participated in these consultations. The process has been very constructive and certainly has assisted the government in making a range of improvements to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I place on record the government's appreciation of the contributions that have been made and say very clearly that in our view they are both valuable and valued. The consultations have also given the Department of Defence and the ADF an opportunity to examine their administration of rehabilitation and compensation and to establish a clear direction for future development. I also appreciate the contributions by the opposition and other senators who, while supporting the legislation, have raised a number of valid concerns and issues for government consideration. I believe the final product is very much working in the common interests and wellbeing of our service personnel. </PARA>

<PARA>The importance of that constitution of the commission which governs SRCA lies in the fact that all the groups covered by SRCA have representation on the commission. What the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Faulkner) is proposing to do tonight is incorporate the group who are principally the targets of the Military Compensation Bill and deny them their representation. It cannot get representation by granting an amendment which provides for an additional member in the shape of a serving member of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a little presumptuous of Senator Woodley to assume that our objection to this was that a member of the ADF cannot adequately represent the interests of the veteran; rather, the inverted argument is the point. I would argue that a serving member of the ADF cannot represent the interests of the ADF, let alone the interests of a veteran. On many occasions and in many circumstances, a veteran who is an experienced former member of the ADF is much better able to represent the interests of both parties before this commission than a serving member. No serving member of the ADF enjoys independence before the commission. That is a simple fact of life. That was why the Senate in its wisdom&mdash;Senator Harradine, the Greens, the Democrats, the National Party and the Liberal Party&mdash;voted for the amendment on Tuesday night, not 48 hours ago, to give representation to the group which is affected by this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Conflict of interest is inherent and inevitable in the proposal that the minister is putting before us. It is impossible for a serving member of the ADF to operate as an independent agent when he sits on that commission. The minister only has to think about it, even with the limited perceptions and horizons that he has, to realise that I am right in this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation could well arise where we had a member of the ADF with a compensation claim under the military compensation scheme acts administered by the Department of Defence that the department had refused to satisfy. The minister wants a commission member who is part of the ADF to set aside his interest, the directions that he would receive from the Department of Defence, to support the decision made within that department and stand as an impartial judge on the merits of the case. One only has to state the case to see how impossible it is. That is why it was the responsible and the correct decision of this house of review to take the decision it did 48 hours ago to give representation to the veterans' community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not mind if the permanent ADF member was deleted from the commission so long as the person who represented the veterans' organisation had been a senior or long-serving member of the ADF in his professional career. We would then get the impartial advice on the commission of SRCA that must be had in this case, and that must be had in fairness to the veterans' community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far in the debates in this chamber no reason has been given as to why the government must have its way on this. Those of us who sit on this side of the chamber know very well that the government has this irrational belief that it must get its own way at all times on all occasions. The business of sitting down and reasoning together and coming to a conclusion that involves a little bit of compromise but satisfies the best interests of the nation is never undertaken by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there are 10 members of a commission, how can the minister argue that putting an 11th member on the commission will somehow or other open the floodgates to waves and waves of superannuants, retired public servants and members of odd unions that are not affiliated with the ACTU? It is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that. It is just as ludicrous to suggest that a serving member of the ADF can operate as an independent entity on the commission. The Liberal Party and the National Party will oppose this amendment, and we do so for the reasons that I have stated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the next part of the Safety Rehabilitation and Compensation Act that the minister may or may not have read, it deals with deputies for members&mdash;and we would like the Democrats to listen to this because I am sure they do not know this exists&mdash;and in section 89H it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A member (other than the Chairperson) may, with the Minister's approval, appoint a person to be the member's deputy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person must not be appointed to be the deputy of the member referred to in paragraph 89E(1)(f) unless the person is a prescribed staff member within the meaning of section 89E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(3)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A member may revoke the appointment of his or her deputy, but the revocation is not effective until the member has given written notice of the revocation to the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(4)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a member who has appointed a deputy is absent from a meeting of the Commission, the deputy is entitled to attend that meeting and, when so attending, is taken to be a member;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(5)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A deputy may resign by delivering to the member who appointed him or her a signed notice of resignation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(6)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anything done by or in relation to a deputy purporting to act under this section is not invalid merely because:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">there is a defect or irregularity in connection with the <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">appointment; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the appointment has ceased to have effect; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the occasion for the deputy to act had not arisen or had <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ceased.</PARA>
<PARA>My reading of that section of the act is that the minister has the authority to appoint a deputy to be a member of the commission. Furthermore, if we go back to section 89D which I read earlier, we find that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(1) <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister may, by notice in writing given to the Chairperson, give a direction to the Commission with respect to the performance of its functions or the exercise of its powers under this Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(2)<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission must comply with a direction given under subsection (1).</PARA>
<PARA>So I do not think it possible to challenge the power that the minister has. I put it to the minister that under section 89H he obviously has the power to appoint a deputy. I would ask the minister as a matter of principle whether he is prepared to give this Senate an undertaking that, where a matter of conflict or a matter of controversy involving a serving member of the ADF comes before the commission for debate, the minister will take the honest and ethical step of exercising the powers vested in him under section 89H and appoint a member of the veterans' community to the commission as a substitute while that case is heard. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">BANKING (STATE BANK OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA AND OTHER MATTERS) BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary purpose of this bill is to facilitate South Australia's compliance with some of the principal conditions attaching to the special assistance package which the Commonwealth is providing to South Australia over a three year period. These conditions relate to: the sale of the State Bank of South Australia (SBSA); subjecting the bank to Commonwealth taxation; and the transfer by legislation of prudential supervision powers over the bank to the Reserve Bank of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 17 February 1993, the Prime Minister issued a press release stating that the Government was prepared to provide special assistance to South Australia with a net present value of $600 million, in recognition of the extraordinary financial burden imposed on the people of South Australia as a consequence of the losses incurred by the SBSA. The severity of this financial burden was such that, in the absence of the special assistance package, South Australia's ability to participate in the economic recovery now underway would have been severely constrained. In return for the provision of the assistance, South Australia gave certain undertakings to the Commonwealth, including that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the SBSA be sold as quickly as practicable consistent with achieving a fair market price;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the SBSA be brought into the Commonwealth's tax net free of tax losses from 1 July 1994;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the SBSA be subject to the prudential supervision of the Reserve Bank of Australia no later than 1 July 1994 by legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a debt management strategy designed to restore South Australia's finances to a more sustainable position be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The South Australian Government is moving to comply with these conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process of preparing the SBSA for eventual sale involves the creation of a new corporatised entity from 1 July 1994 to be named the Bank of South Australia Limited (or BankSA). BankSA will carry on the core business of the SBSA, including housing loans, credit cards, deposit facilities, and rural and business lending, and will continue to operate some interstate business in areas such as small scale leasing and commercial lending. These activities are being transferred to BankSA under South Australian and complementary interstate legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time the conditions of South Australia's special assistance package were being agreed, the previous Commonwealth Treasurer undertook to facilitate South Australia's compliance with the conditions through Commonwealth legislation where necessary or justified. In this context, amendments to Commonwealth legislation are required to accommodate the referral of banking supervision powers over the bank to the Commonwealth and to facilitate the process of subjecting the bank to Commonwealth taxes. In fulfilment of this undertaking, the bill contains amendments to the Banking Act 1959 and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 (the act) was substantially amended during 1993 to give effect to the recommendations arising from the review of the act by the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the more significant changes was the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority (the authority) which is to exercise ATSIC powers and functions with respect to Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons in the Torres Strait area. The authority will commence operating on 1 July this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will extend the powers of the TSRA to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable the Prime Minister to confer a departmental function on the authority;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">enable the minister to confer commission functions on the authority;</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">to allow the authority to use monies in the TSRA Land and Resources Fund for the development and implementation of the marine strategy referred to in the Torres Strait Development Plan, or in developing or maintaining real estate or in acquiring an interest in land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also allows the minister at his or her discretion to make rules for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards including the power to prescribe the maximum number of members per ward.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two other amendments relate to the Zone Election Rules and clarifies when elections for Regional Councils, Commissioners, the TSRA and any other election are completed for the purposes of filing election petitions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the major provisions of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments relating to the Torres Strait Regional Authority</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 7 enables the Prime Minister to confer departmental functions on the Authority and the minister to confer a function of the Commission on the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments are necessary as the Authority will from 1 July this year exercise ATSIC powers and functions in the Torres Strait and as ATSIC will no longer operate in the Torres Strait area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 8 and 9 give the authority the power to negotiate and co-operate with other Commonwealth, State, Territory and local government bodies and to enter into agreements and make grants and loans to the State of Queensland or an authority of that State including local government bodies. This is essential for the Authority to be able to operate independently from ATSIC in the Torres Strait particularly as the Island Councils which will be major beneficiaries of TSRA funding are local authorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 13 enables the Minister to make rules for the conduct of TSRA elections by a system of wards. It should be noted that the provisions allow for maximum flexibility so that rules can be made for the conduct of elections in the Torres Strait area or in any part of the Torres Strait area by a system of wards. The current Notice under section 116 can be continued under section 143S(2)(a) of the Act as amended. This Notice allows the Minister, at his or her discretion, to declare that the Torres Strait Regional Council would best be able to represent the Torres Strait Islanders and Aboriginal persons living in the Torres Strait area if it consisted of, or included, persons elected to represent particular communities in the Torres Strait.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should also be noted that TSRA election rules including rules for the conduct of elections by a system of wards can only be made by the Minister after consulting the Authority and the Australian Electoral Commission. Clauses 14 to 23 are consequential to the amendment providing for wards in the Torres Strait area.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 25 broadens the scope of the TSRA Land and Resources Fund. The provision in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Act (No. 3) 1993 establishing the TSRA Land and Resources Fund (section 144W) stipulates that monies in the fund may only be spent in making grants for the acquisition of land and in acquiring land. However, because the Torres Strait is essentially a marine environment, the purposes for which monies in the Fund may be spent should be broadened to include development and on going maintenance of real property, including improvements to such property and the development of marine resources in accordance with the marine strategy to be contained in the Torres Strait Development Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments Relating to Zone Election Rules</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 varies the current provisions of the Act which requires that zone elections including supplementary elections must be conducted under the rules in force at the end of the election period for the preceding round of Regional Council elections. The bill provides that a supplementary zone election must be conducted in accordance with the rules in force immediately before the day on which the Minister fixes the last day for the close of the poll for the supplementary election. A supplementary election is defined as:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"(a)a zone election held to fill a casual vacancy in the office of Commissioner representing the zone; or</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> (b)a zone election held in place of a zone election in relation to which the Federal Court of Australia has made an order under Schedule 4."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly it is proper that any supplementary election be held under the rules in force at the time the Minister calls such an election.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The rules in force for a normal round of zone elections following a round of Regional Council elections will continue to be those rules in force at the end of the election period for the preceding round of Regional Council elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">End of Election Period for Zone and Other Election Purposes</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 30 amends Schedule 4 of the Act to provide when petitions may be lodged with the Federal Court of Australia in respect of a round of Regional Council elections, a round of Zone elections, a TSRA election for all the wards, and for any other election. Currently, section 140 provides that the provisions of Schedule 4 apply where there is a dispute in relation to a Regional Council election or a zone election. Item 3(e) of Schedule 4 provides that subject to clause 5 (which deals with petitions by the AEC), every election petition shall be filed in a Registry of the Court within 40 days after the end of the election period. The ATSIC Act does not stipulate what the "end of the election period" is in relation to a zone election. The Attorney General's Department has advised that the Act should be amended to indicate clearly the meaning of paragraph 3(e) of Schedule 4 in relation to elections subject to challenge by virtue of section 140 of the ATSIC Act. Clause 30 of the bill expressly provides that any petition disputing an election (whether a general election or a supplementary election) must be filed in a Registry of the Federal Court within 40 days after the last day on which a poll is declared.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains non-controversial but essential provisions for the efficient and effective operations of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, provides for supplementary zone elections under rules which are current at the time of the election and clarifies the commencement dates for petition periods for all elections conducted under the Act.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of Part 2 of the bill is to amend the Australian Industry Development Corporation Act 1970 to facilitate the reduction in the Australian Industry Development Corporation's equity in its major subsidiary, AIDC Ltd, from the current level of about 80% to a minimum of 51%, as announced in the 1992-93 Budget. Proceeds from this would flow to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reduction of the Corporation's equity in AIDC Ltd will not affect the Government's guarantee of the Corporation's liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When announcing the decision in August 1992 to reduce the share holding in AIDC Ltd, the Government said that this would be undertaken when the full value of the underlying assets of AIDC Ltd could be obtained and the sale of the shares would be effected in a manner that would ensure minimal disruption to the share price and the company's operations. That statement was in recognition that AIDC Ltd shares were then grossly undervalued when trading at less than $0.70, and to inform the financial markets of the Government's intentions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIDC Ltd's share price has since rebounded as a result of its vastly improved performance, and the financial analysts have given strong support to its shares. In recent times AIDC Ltd shares have been trading well above the issue price of $2.00, and indications are that the market forecasts of its profitability will continue to translate into strong market support for AIDC Ltd shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At recent share prices, the sale of this portion of AIDC Ltd shares would raise around $100 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I shall now briefly outline the measures contained in this part of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments provide for a reduction in AIDC's holding in AIDC Ltd to not less than 51% by transferring shares to the Commonwealth, which would subsequently sell them. It is important to note that the bill stipulates that the Corporation cannot reduce its shareholding to below 51%. This will ensure that the Commonwealth will continue to retain beneficial majority ownership of AIDC Ltd.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amendment is also contained in the bill to ensure that the Corporation's statutory borrowing constraint will not be breached as a result of the transfer of shares to the Commonwealth. This is to cover a technicality arising from accounting standards, that would not have operated if the Corporation itself undertook the sale of the shares. A further amendment is required, as a result of a technicality in the AIDC Act, to enable the Corporation to pass on dividends it may receive from AIDC Ltd despite technically posting a loss as a result of shares it transfers to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer of shares to the Commonwealth and subsequent sale by the Commonwealth could involve these transactions being subject to certain State and Territory taxes and charges, in particular stamp duty. In the absence of any action, this would depress the expected returns to the Commonwealth (and hence to all taxpayers) from the sale of these assets and would benefit only the taxpayers in the particular State or Territory where the taxes are paid. It would also complicate the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid these issues the bill provides that the sale of the initial transfer of AIDC Ltd shares from the Corporation to the Commonwealth, and the subsequent sale by the Commonwealth and any related transactions will be exempted from State and Territory taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in Part 2 of the bill will allow for the sell down of AIDC Ltd shares announced by the Government in August 1992, and ensure that the benefits of this accrue to Australian taxpayers. At the same time, the Corporation will continue to maintain its existing relationship with AIDC Ltd, including its role of principal borrower on behalf of the AIDC Group.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the National Measurement Act 1960</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The objects of the National Measurement Act 1960 include establishing a national system of units and standards of measurement of physical quantities and providing for their uniform use. The National Measurement Act is administered by the National Standards Commission, a Commonwealth statutory authority established in 1950.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill will amend the National Measurement Act by increasing the number of Commissioners serving on the National Standards Commission, by giving the Commission the power to invest its money, to provide financial assistance, and by making other changes of an administrative nature.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission currently comprises a Chairperson, the Executive Director and six other members. The Chairperson is usually an eminent scientist or technologist while the members bring to the Commission a great breadth of experience at a very senior level. These members represent high technology industry, CSIRO, consumer interests, the trade measurement industry, the National Association of Testing Authorities, trade measurement authorities and academia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A Program evaluation of the Commission was carried out between December 1991 and March 1992 by Dr Kevin Foley, who was chosen by the Evaluation Steering Committee which comprised representatives of the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, the Department of Finance, the Bureau of Industry Economics and the National Standards Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recommendation six of the evaluation report dealt with expanding the skills, perspective and experience of the Commission by increasing their numbers by two to a total of ten Commissioners. This bill implements that recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments allowing the Commission to enter into contracts involving amounts up to $250,000 without Ministerial approval, and allowing it to invest surplus funds resulting from cost recoverable activities, brings it into line with other similar government bodies. Provision of a granting power to the Commission will enable it to make grants of financial assistance for purposes related to metrology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the Patents Act 1990</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Patents Act 1990 brings that Act in line with recent amendments made to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 by the Maritime Legislation Amendment Act 1994. The Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 now defines Australia's Continental Shelf by reference to the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, not the earlier (1958) Convention on the Continental Shelf.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Amendment of the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the amendment to s24(5)(b) of the Pooled Development Funds (PDF) Act 1992 is to extend the period for which the most recent audited accounts can be used to determine the value of the total assets of an investee business before a Pooled Development Fund (PDF) invests from 12 months to 18 months. This change reflects the fact that audited accounts for the previous financial year are generally not available for up to six months into the current financial year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently section 24 of the Pooled Development Funds Act specifies that the size of the investee company at the time of the initial investment by a PDF must not exceed $30 million total assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 24(5)(b) requires that the audited accounts, used to determine the value of the total assets of the investee business, must relate to a period that ended not more than 12 months before the investment is made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment of the period from 12 months to 18 months in section 24(5)(b) permits, where necessary, the use of the investee company's most recent audited accounts to determine the value of the total assets. At present PDFs are prevented from investing in investee companies typically for up to the first six months of any current financial year, because audited accounts for the previous year are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other timing constraints of section 24(5) remain unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Pooled Development Funds Act 1992 will have no impact on Commonwealth expenditure.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Law and Justice Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 will amend seven Acts coming within the Attorney-General's portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill contains amendments of a minor policy nature, makes minor technical amendments to existing legislation and corrects a drafting error. None of the amendments concerns major policy proposals or sensitive policy issues. They are explained in the Explanatory Memorandum circulated with the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments will not have any significant financial impact. However, the amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 may lead to some minor savings in the administration of delegations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 will ensure that a delegation to a class of offices will include offices created after the instrument of delegation was made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments in the bill to the Cheques and Payment Orders Act 1986 will improve procedures for the physical and electronic presentment of cheques. The amendments will facilitate greater use of electronic presentments. The amendments were sought by the Australian Payments Clearing Association.  </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cheques and Payment Orders Act currently enables a demand for the payment of a cheque (`presentment') to be made electronically by the collecting bank to the drawee or paying bank without the physical movement of the cheque itself between the two banks. However, electronic presentment has not been widely used. This has been partly because the banking industry, in considering how to implement electronic presentment at the practical level, has concluded that the Act should clearly distinguish between electronic presentments within the one bank and those between different banks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Therefore, the proposed amendments will provide for a distinction between the internal and external presentment of cheques. This will enable a drawee or paying bank to present internally to itself, without the restrictions set out in the amendments as to places, times and means of communication, which will apply to external presentment between banks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new provisions applying to internal and external presentment will also apply to the presentment of payment orders drawn on non-bank financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Family Law Act 1975 will correct a drafting error in section 22.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 to widen the powers of a single judge in appeal procedures. The bill will confer upon a single judge the power to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">join or remove parties of an appeal;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">make orders by consent disposing of an appeal, including orders for costs; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also amend the Federal Court Act to give the Federal Court the ability to take evidence by video link, telephone or other appropriate means.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also provide the Federal Court with a discretion to take unsworn evidence by video link, telephone or other appropriate means from a person in another country. This will allow the Federal Court to overcome the difficulty of taking foreign evidence, particularly where the laws or conventions of other countries prevent the administration of an oath or affirmation by Australian courts. Where unsworn evidence is taken, the Court can give such weight to that evidence as it thinks fit in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Court Act will also be amended to enable Rules of Court to be made so that the Court will have a discretion to amend documents in a proceeding even though the effect of the amendment would be to raise a new cause of action that would, if proceedings in relation to it were commenced at the time of the amendment, be out of time. The amendment will put the Federal Court in a similar position to most other State and Territory Supreme Courts, which already have this power. It will also overcome the rule in Weldon v Neal (1887) 19 QBD 394, which prevents such amendments being made. Comments by the Hon. Justice Toohey in the decision of the High Court in Wardley Australia Ltd v Western Australia (1992) 175 CLR 514 suggest that an amendment to the Act is needed to enable Rules of Court to be made to overcome any doubt there may be about the Court's rule making power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 will give the Director of the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC) the powers of a Departmental Secretary in relation to certain matters. The Director will be provided with equivalent powers to those which a Departmental Secretary possesses under the Public Service Act 1922. This amendment will also allow AUSTRAC to be prescribed under the Audit Act 1901 so that it will be responsible for the management of its funds and financial reporting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also contains a number of amendments to the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (FOI Act). In 1991, section 27A of the Act was amended to remove a precondition to the requirement to consult individuals where an application was made under the Act for a document that contained personal information that related to that individual. The precondition was that the individual to whom the information related might reasonably wish to contend that the document was exempt. The requirement to consult has become unduly onerous. The bill will provide for the reinsertion of the precondition and will contain guidance on matters to be taken into account in making the decision whether an individual might reasonably wish to object to disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will amend the sections of the FOI Act which provide for internal review of decisions and appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to overcome a difficulty raised by a decision of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which denied an applicant a right of appeal where the agency claimed that it had given access to all the documents requested but the applicant claimed that there were further documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part II of Schedule 2 of the FOI Act will be amended to include specified documents of the Australian Statistician and documents in relation to the competitive commercial activities of Comcare and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) amongst those which may not be obtained under the Act. The bill will amend Part III of Schedule 2 to delete a reference to the repealed Honey Marketing Act 1988. The bill will include CSIRO in Schedule 4 of the Act with the effect that certain research documents of CSIRO will be exempt from applications under the Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The protection given by sections 91 and 92 of the FOI Act will be extended to situations where agencies are required to consult third parties before releasing documents to applicants. Section 91 of the Act provides protection against specified civil actions where applicants are given access to documents in accordance with that section. Section 92 of the Act provides protection against prosecution for criminal offences in the same circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The FOI Act will also be amended to extend the exemption under the Act for information which identifies confidential informants to persons protected under the National Witness Protection Program.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill will also make miscellaneous amendments to the FOI Act to improve the administration of the Act. These include:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to replace the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 with new legislation to enable plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they develop.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Essentially the Breeder's Rights Bill (`the PBR bill') falls within the scope of public policy established over 15 years from 1971 to 1986 by extensive public inquiry that included an exhaustive inquiry in 1986 by a Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That Senate standing committee recommended, among other things, that a plant variety rights scheme be established, that legislation be drafted to conform to the 1978 Convention of the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of plants, known as `UPOV', and that Australia accede to the 1978 UPOV Convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aim of re-writing and re-naming the legislation is principally to conform to the 1991 revision of the UPOV convention.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PBR legislation conforming to the 1991 UPOV Convention is expected to provide a greater stimulus than the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 to innovation by encouraging increased investment in plant breeding and technology transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continued innovation is needed to maintain Australia's competitiveness in agricultural and horticultural industries and the stimulation of technology transfer is crucial to maintaining Australia's access to new plant varieties for all plant industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These aims will be more easily achieved if Australia, harmonises its legislation and accedes to the 1991 UPOV Convention because other member countries of UPOV are preparing to do so and amending their legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation when harmonised with that of other member countries under the 1991 UPOV Convention, from which some reciprocal rights are possible, is also expected to provide a stimulus to the seed export trade.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The opportunity was also taken whilst the new bill was in preparation to introduce other provisions that would further increase the efficiency of the plant variety rights scheme (PVR scheme) and the effectiveness of varietal protection without going beyond the limits of the 1991 UPOV Convention or compromising the public interest provisions of the Plant Variety Rights Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The plain English used in the PBR bill should promote a better understanding of, and a wider interest in, the legislation on which the plant breeders rights scheme will be based.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The change in the name of the legislation to plant breeder's rights brings it into line with the new UPOV convention and common usage internationally for this form of intellectual property protection.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 will be repealed following the successful passage and proclamation of the Plant Breeder's Rights bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Transitional arrangements to the new legislation will be convenient and simple to implement. All of the approximately 1000 applications that have been made for plant variety rights in the five years since the commencement of the scheme will be either deemed to have been granted PBR or, should they be in the process of being examined on the day of proclamation, they will continue to be examined under the old act and, if successful, they will be granted PBR. No grantee of PVR under the old act will be disadvantaged by the transition arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The important changes to the legislation in the PBR bill have been developed in consultation with the National Farmers Federation, the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia and the Nursery Industry Association of Australia, and has their support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would like to point out in this regard the efforts made by the Grains Council of Australia on behalf of grain growers to find solutions, using PBR legislation, to stimulate investment in breeding our principal grain crops which that industry knows is an important element in maintaining our international trading competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The PBR bill provides for increased scope and effectiveness of the breeder's right on protected varieties and it is envisaged that, in the national interest, all sectors of the agriculture and horticulture industries, including public and private plant breeders, will jointly use the strategic business assets that PBR provides to develop marketing and breeder royalty systems appropriate to their industry sectors.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, I would like to reassure the Senate that all the public interest features of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1978 have been retained and even extended in the PBR bill and thus the essential balance between the public interest and the extended breeder's right has been maintained.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">PRIMARY INDUSTRIES AND ENERGY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to introduce amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988, Agricultural and Veterinary Chemical Products (Collection of Levy) Act 1994, the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992, the Quarantine Act 1908, the Snowy Mountains Hydro-electric Power Act 1949 and the Rural Adjustment Act 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will extend the sunset provision in the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 Act from 30 June 1994 to 30 June 1996. This is a contingency measure in the event that the states do not pass legislation for the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Code to commence in their jurisdiction on 1 July 1994. The 1988 Act is repealed upon commencement of the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1994 which was passed by parliament on 1 March 1994 as part of a package of agricultural and veterinary chemicals legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Within this bill there are three amendments to the Quarantine Act 1908. Two of these amendments provide legislative support for practices developed to enable the resources of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) to be directed towards higher risk imports and the third gives effect to certain recommendations of the Auditor-General.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Two of the three amendments of the Quarantine Act 1908 build on the successful partnership between industry and government in quarantine protection. They underpin arrangements entered into between AQIS and imported goods handlers such as customs agents, freight forwarders, some importers of goods and those contracted to handle ships waste, to ensure an appropriate degree of quarantine surveillance is maintained over imported cargo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The electronic entry and clearance of cargo for quarantine purposes is progressively being implemented at major ports around Australia. AQIS, customs and industry have worked together closely to develop and implement a system that provides necessary quarantine security but at minimal cost to industry. This bill, by inserting in the Quarantine Act 1908 provisions to permit the electronic entry of goods for quarantine purposes, and the processing, recording and notification of quarantine decisions about those goods, gives legislative backing to the electronic systems being introduced. Existing customs and industry systems are used and no new administrative burdens will be placed on importers nor on the Australian Customs Service. The regulation-making powers included in the new provisions are intended to allow the flexibility required to meet technological and organisational developments in industry. To ensure that the system can operate effectively, it has been necessary to require that all imports be notified. Again, existing practices will be recognised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments for electronic processing also clarify the responsibility for compliance with directions given by a quarantine officer in the importation process. A clearance system based on documentation requires compliance where the documentation indicates a possible quarantine risk. The importer, agent or broker seeking quarantine clearance who is given a quarantine direction will be responsible for meeting the direction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These amendments also make provision for compliance agreements. These are arrangements effected between the Commonwealth and industry, on an individual basis, permitting industry to undertake certain quarantine procedures. Quarantine security is not jeopardised. AQIS conducts regular audits of operations and is responsible for final quarantine clearance of goods, and severe penalties are imposed for wilful non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with debt management practice in the AQIS food inspection programs, this legislation will enable AQIS to withhold services where debts remain outstanding, and to charge a penalty fee for late payment. AQIS will also be able to take a deposit or charge a booking fee, or both, for a place at quarantine stations. These measures give legislative effect to relevant recommendations of the 1992 report on the efficiency audit of the quarantine division of AQIS by the Australian National Audit Office. Incorporation of these provisions in the act is an interim measure pending the development, in consultation with industry, of a revised legislative basis for the collection of AQIS fees and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the remaining amendments included in this bill are of a procedural nature directed to improving the administration of the issues dealt with in those acts. The amendments to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 will remove gender specific terminology and enable the appointment of an acting commissioner, or acting assistant commissioner, for the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority for more than 12 months.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Foreign Evidence Bill 1994</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The aspects of the Foreign Evidence Bill with which we are concerned today have been considered by the Senate on a previous occasion. The issue relates to the matters a court must take into account when considering whether to exclude, in the exercise of its discretion, foreign material which otherwise is admissible. The scheme of the Bill is to make foreign evidence prima facie admissible, subject to two mandatory exceptions. This is provided under clause 24 in Part 3 and clause 32 in Part 4 of the Bill. As the debate on this aspect of the Bill has been on Part 3 I shall continue to focus on Part 3, but the arguments apply equally to Part 4.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subclause 25(1) maintains the common law discretion in a court to exclude legally admissible material, and in particular foreign material that is admissible under clause 24. If foreign material is not admissible under clause 24 then that is the end of the matter so far as that material is concerned. The foreign material that may be excluded under subclause 25(1) includes evidence that is of low probative value but highly prejudicial to an accused person. However, under subclause 25(2) the court when considering exercising its discretion to exclude legally admissible foreign material must take into account certain matters. In the Bill as originally introduced into this place four matters were set out. At the suggestion of the Opposition the Government agreed to include a fifth matter which the court must consider in its exercise of the discretion to exclude foreign material, new paragraph 25(2)(e).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It became apparent to the Government that the paragraph, which was drafted on the run during the debate, was less than perfect and that a better formulation could be drafted. The Government had proposed to introduce an amendment in the House of Representatives but, by way of counter proposal, the Opposition moved its own amendment in the House. The Government supported the Opposition's amendment. Now we understand that the Opposition may be proposing a further amendment to paragraph 25(2)(e) to amend the formulation that the Opposition themselves proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government, quite frankly, believes this to be a waste of parliamentary time. The Government does not consider that the proposed amendment adds anything of substance not already covered by clause 25(1). Clause 25(2) sets out certain grounds that the court must have regard to when considering whether to exercise the discretion in clause 25(1), without in any way limiting the generality of clause 25(1). The Explanatory Memorandum has been revised (at Paragraph 40) to make it clear that the discretion covers the exclusion of evidence that is highly prejudicial but of low probative value. Parliamentary time is sufficiently precious for it not to be wasted on semantic niceties.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of discussions with the Opposition the Explanatory Memorandum has been significantly redrafted to better explain the interaction between clauses 24 and 25 and clauses 32 and 33. In a spirit of co-operation paragraphs 25(2)(e) and 33(2)(e) have been inserted into the legislation. Both of these efforts have significantly enhanced the legislation. But there is a law of diminishing returns. As I have already said the proposed words, while perhaps reflecting a nuance, do not add anything to the substance of the clause. There must be an end, at some point, to the redrafting of provisions of proposed legislation, otherwise the Senate will deal with nothing else. Therefore the Government supports the Bill, as returned from the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>During the course of discussions with the opposition on the interaction between clauses 24 and 25, and 32 and 33, the government agreed to modify the explanatory memorandum to better explain their operation. The government has honoured its commitment. I table the replacement memorandum which, I understand the opposition agrees, clarifies the operation of those provisions.</PARA>

<PARA>These two amendments&mdash;one substantive and the other consequential&mdash;are a consequence of an amendment being taken on the run, so to speak, when we last considered this matter. At that time, the government looked at those amendments and said, `Well, they have good intentions. They are not bad but, if you're going to do it in the criminal area, you should do it in the civil area as well'. I think in the other place there was a bit of argy-bargy about the appropriate words to use, and it looked as though everything might be okay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to that though there were meetings between officers of the department. I am not sure whether the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) was there but certainly the shadow Attorney-General (Mr Williams) was. There has been some disagreement as to the relationship between two opportunities to include and exclude evidence. The shadow attorney believes it would be appropriate to omit the words `whether exclusion' and substitute `whether the admission or exclusion' in relation to 33(2)(e) and 25(2)(e)&mdash;being, respectively, the criminal and civil matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very technical area.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Williams,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of 2 March 1994 concerning the Foreign Evidence Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I thank you for your support in the debate last evening. As you are aware, the Government was more than happy to support the amendments moved by you to paragraphs 25(2)(e) and 33(2)(e).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is also prepared to recast those parts of the Explanatory Memorandum that relate to clauses 24 and 32 (and clauses 25 and 33) in order to clarify what is meant by admissible evidence for the purposes of those provisions. Let me say that there is no intention to fundamentally change the law relating to what evidence would be admissible if given by a person in Court, and on this point there is no dispute. What I do have some difficulty with is the particular proposal as set out in your letter, not because I disagree with the principle but because it does not seem to be a good example of the type of problem I, and the departmental officers, understood we were seeking to address.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the risk of making points you no doubt have already focused on I think it might be useful to set out my understanding of the interaction between clause 24 and clause 25. The same interactions apply equally to clauses 32 and 33 but for the purposes of argument I propose to focus on clauses 24 and 25.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first point to consider is terminology. There is the overall admissibility question which is broken into two parts;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the first part relates to whether the evidence is admissible in a strict application of the law (sometimes referred to as legal admissibility) and relates to such things as the competence of the witness, hearsay or whether a person who purports to give such evidence as an expert is qualified to give evidence as an expert etc.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the second part relates to the exercise of a discretion in the court to exclude certain types of evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding of the scheme of the Bill is that Clauses 24, particularly paragraph 24(2)(b) seeks to address the legal admissibility question and relies on the existing law in that area, while clause 25 seeks to reflect the court's discretion to exclude legally admissible evidence. Clauses 24 and 25 together seek to:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">introduce a rule that prima facie the foreign evidence is admissible unless the person could give it in person or it would not have been legally admissible; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">preserve a broad discretion in the court to exclude such legally admissible evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The combined effect is to modify existing rules of evidence only in relation to certain foreign evidence, and in respect of that only to overcome legal admissibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the discussions you had with departmental officers the examples discussed included that used by Senator Ellison of low probative but highly prejudicial evidence. The discussion then turned to whether evidence that would not normally be legally admitted would be admitted under clause 24. I am advised that the departmental officers suggested that the Explanatory Memorandum could be amended so as to clarify this concern. On reflection, however, I am not sure that evidence of low probative value but highly prejudicial is necessarily a good example to put into the Explanatory Memorandum in relation to clause 24. I say this for the reason that, as stated in your letter, the issue is not whether such evidence is legally admissible but whether in the exercise of the court's discretion such evidence could be excluded. I agree with your view of the court's discretion at common law but I consider, as outlined above, that that general discretion of the court at common law is reflected in clause 25 and therefore the appropriate place to reflect such a discretion is properly in clause 25. In order to make this clear the Explanatory Memorandum in respect of clause 25 could be amended and could include the example of low probative but highly prejudicial evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am of the opinion that, if your view of the admissibility test in paragraph 24(2)(b) is correct there would be a discretion to exclude evidence inherent in paragraph 24(2)(b) which would either nullify clause 25 (because the discretion addressed in clause 25 merely seeks to reflect the court's common law discretion which would then be imported into clause 24) or create a two tiered system of discretions where clause 25 would give a discretion to exclude evidence notwithstanding that the court had already considered exercising its discretion, and decided not to exercise it, under clause 24. Neither of these results are, to my mind, desirable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I regret any confusion created in discussions on this matter and am not suggesting that the Government will not honour commitments given in the discussions. This is, obviously, a very complex and technical issue and I think there has perhaps not been a meeting of minds on the issue. I am more than happy to discuss this issue with you should you so wish.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter dated 3 March 1994 concerning the Foreign Evidence Bill 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your view that it is undesirable that clauses 25 and 32, and in particular clauses 25(2)(b) and 33(2)(b), should be interpreted to allow the court to exercise a common law-type discretion when determining what foreign material may be adduced as evidence. Your view is that the common law discretion to exclude is reflected in clauses 25 and 33.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I understand that difficulties could arise from a tiering of discretions, the amendments moved by me in the House were done so on the basis that at the initial stage in the statutory scheme (clauses 24 and 33, respectively), the court would not admit evidence the prejudicial effect of which outweighed its probative value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My concern in this respect was highlighted by the amendment moved by Senator Ellison in the Senate (as later varied at your request) that the court must consider in exercising the discretion to exclude evidence under clauses 25 and 33, respectively whether the exclusion of the foreign material would unfairly prejudice any party to the proceeding. My difficulty was that there was no corresponding requirement that the court consider whether <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">inclusion</EMPHASIS> of the foreign material would cause unfair prejudice. Whilst such a factor could be considered under the broad discretion to exclude under 25(1) and 33(1), it need not be expressly considered by the court. Further, the amendment contained a practical and illogical emphasis on the <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">exclusion</EMPHASIS> of the evidence causing prejudice as opposed to its <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">inclusion</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In my meeting with officers of the Attorney-General's Department I suggested that clauses 25(2)(e) and 33(2)(e) be amended to include reference to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">inclusion</EMPHASIS> as well as <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">exclusion</EMPHASIS> of the evidence causing prejudice. The view was expressed by Attorney-General officers that that would be inconsistent with the scheme of clauses 25 and 33 to provide for the exclusion of otherwise admissible evidence. I do not see that that necessarily follows.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the bulk of my difficulties were resolved following discussion of the relationship of clauses 24 and 25 (and 32 and 33) to the discretion of a court at common law to exclude evidence, which would otherwise be admissible, on the basis of the prejudicial effect of the evidence as against its probative value. As noted above, it was my understanding from the discussion that the intention was that the common law discretion would be retained within clauses 24(2)(b) and 32(2)(b). That would deal with my difficulties because it would be at that preliminary point that the court would consider that evidence should not be adduced (ie <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">included</EMPHASIS>) on the basis that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by its prejudicial effect. It was on that basis that my further amendments were moved in the House.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given your difficulties with a two-tiered discretion, my original problem returns. Given that judicial discretion to exclude evidence resides exclusively in clauses 25 and 33, the disparity between specific regard being made to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">exclusion</EMPHASIS> of evidence causing unfair prejudice as opposed to <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">inclusion</EMPHASIS> is highlighted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This difficulty can be resolved simply by amending both clause 25(2)(e) and clause 33(2)(e) to omit "whether exclusion" and substituting "whether the admission or exclusion".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would welcome your support for the amendments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I realise that this is a technical point which has already consumed considerable parliamentary and departmental time. The further amendment will add to that. However in my view the question is of significance to parties to proceedings involving foreign evidence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect, you have missed the point of my letter dated 16 March 1994. The reason that I did not raise the question whether a reference to inclusion should be inserted in paragraphs 25(2)(e) and 33(2)(e) in the debate in the House is explained in the first complete paragraph of the second page of my letter. I made reference to that background in my speech in the second reading debate on 2 March.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My understanding of the intention as to the judge's discretion was derived from what I was told in the meeting with officers of the Attorney-General's Department earlier that day.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can perhaps give the Senate an outline of what happened in relation to this matter. It might be of assistance to trace the history of it. When this matter was last in the chamber, a problem came to light in relation to clause 25. That clause deals with the matters that a court might take into account&mdash;whether to give a direction that foreign material not be adduced as evidence. At the time I made the point that prejudice to the defence in a criminal trial would be a germane point to bear in mind because, in clauses 25(2)(a), (b), (c) and (d), we have matters of expense, delay, the probative value and the availability of evidence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I thought at the time was that the question of prejudice should really be canvassed because, whenever one is looking at the admission of evidence, a question of unfair prejudice is always relevant. I note that the amendment was made on the basis that it caused prejudice to the defence, and the prosecution of course was left out. On reading the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> I note that in my address on this matter I did touch on the fact that both parties should be looked at with an even hand. Therefore, I have no problem with looking at prejudice to either party; that is quite fair. In fact, if one looks at the adjournment of a trial, both prosecution and defence are looked at in the same light&mdash;whether the adjournment would cause any unfair prejudice. Similarly, in this case, that should be looked at as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was omitted was looking at it in the civil jurisdiction, which I believe is covered by part 4 and of course relates to clause 33. I think it only appropriate that, when we look at the criminal jurisdiction, we should also have consideration of the civil jurisdiction. I enforce fully the changes that have been made, but it was whilst considering these changes that it came to light that we are talking only about the exclusion of foreign material. If there were a trial in Australia and the defence or the prosecution raised the point that they had some foreign material that they wanted to adduce as evidence, the court would look to the fact of whether excluding it would cause unfair prejudice to either party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was really not canvassed there was the question of the admission of the evidence. I think that that is a crucial point because one has to look at evidence in the light of either admitting it or excluding it. Sometimes, by excluding evidence, courts can potentially rob people of their case. On the other hand, by admitting the evidence courts can sometimes cause unfair prejudice to either side. So, really, the question of admission and exclusion have to go hand in hand. Clause 24 subclause (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The foreign material is not to be adduced as evidence if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) it appears to the court's satisfaction at the hearing of the proceeding that the person who gave the testimony concerned is in Australia and is able to attend the hearing; or</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the evidence would not have been admissible had it been adduced from the person at the hearing.</PARA>
<PARA>This implies the common law doctrine that, when looking at the admission of evidence, the probative value should be weighed against the prejudicial value of the evidence. But I think it most important that bundled in clause 25(2)(e) is the question of admission and exclusion because it really does spell out, as it were, what the court has to take into account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not so certain that clause 24 subclause (2)(b) incorporates that common law doctrine which I have mentioned&mdash;that is, whether evidence should be admitted on the basis of its probative versus prejudicial value. The courts, when they come to a situation such as this where specific criteria are spelt out, will look at the criteria and say that this is what they should be guided by, particularly taking into account clause 25 subclause (2), which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether to give such a direction, it must take into account:&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>and it then goes on to list the specific criteria. That is why I think it is so important in the specifics to spell out in the subclause the question of the prejudice occasioned by exclusion of evidence or admission of evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the last occasion we had a debate&mdash;more like discussion&mdash;on clause 25 a flaw came to light. We have had further time to consider it. This amendment, as put forward by the government&mdash;and, furthermore, as proposed to be amended by the coalition&mdash;is an amendment which perhaps more adequately encompasses and caters for any possible difficulties. I think the situation now, if one takes admission and exclusion into account, would indeed be satisfactory to both sides. Even the prosecution could say, `If you let the defence bring in this evidence, we do not have a chance to rebut it. It places us in an impossible position'. That too is a factor which must be considered. There must be even-handedness with respect to both prosecution and defence and also in the civil jurisdiction with plaintiff and defendant. I think it could work to great advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is a very good bill because it provides for and streamlines the taking of foreign material and use of it as evidence. But the danger that we have&mdash;we must jealously guard against increasing this danger&mdash;is that where a party has evidence from outside the jurisdiction, particular care must be taken that when that party introduces it the other party has a chance to have a say as to whether it will be excluded or omitted and, furthermore, has a chance to gainsay it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the rules of natural justice is that a party can bring in evidence on a matter and the other party must have an opportunity to argue against it. If a testimonial or deposition is taken from someone overseas and the other party does not have an opportunity to quiz that person, that party might say, pursuant to this amendment, `The inclusion is unfairly prejudicial because I have not had a chance to check this out. I have not had a chance to cross-examine. I have not had a chance or the resources to expand on the evidence'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that in one case I dealt with, a deposition was introduced into proceedings by a man who had fled the country and gone to live in America&mdash;and he would not return to give evidence for the defence. The document was introduced and the defence did not have a chance to cross-examine on the document. What was more important was the defence wanted to take further evidence from the person in America. The defence said, `This document does not present the whole picture. There was more to it than that'. That is where this bill will be helpful because it will allow foreign material to be used as evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must remember is not to throw the baby out with the bath water. We must be extremely careful how we introduce that foreign material as evidence and must guard against any possible unfair prejudice. That applies to prosecution or defence, plaintiff or defendant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition's proposition is a sound one. I do not think it is one which will cause the administration of justice any great delay or expense. In fact, when one places it on the scale, an amendment of that sort would only guard against any injustice; with a minimal amount of expense or delay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to relate to the Senate in today's appropriation debate a tragic story on how an Australian bureaucratic organisation has cost Australia the opportunity to enter a new guaranteed and lucrative export industry, how a bureaucratic decision flew in the face of all wisdom, advice and government policy, and how, despite united support from all sectors of the sugar industry, from the government departments whose role it was to address such proposals and which all gave it the thumbs up, still one powerful and unrepresentative commission could override all other opinions and, in turn, do so much damage to our future prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new export industry I am speaking of is the $5 billion international refined sugar export industry. This could have meant at least half a billion dollars of export income for Australia&mdash;and think of the jobs that that would have created! It is an industry that Australia could have entered as a major player with the most advanced technology as a result of a refinery joint venture between CSR, Mackay sugar and the British company E.D. and F. Mann. The merger would have resulted in a more orderly restructuring of the Australian refined sugar industry and achieved the main objective of establishing Australia as a white sugar exporter in the long term. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission said that its role was to ascertain whether the anti-competitive detriment flowing from the merger proposal was outweighed by the public benefit. In this case, the commission found that there was not sufficient public benefit to let the proposal proceed. The commission specifically found that a public benefit from the export industry would not be realised. In the words of the commission, it decided that some of the export benefits, if not all, could be obtained short of the merger proposal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission was plainly wrong in its conclusion. Firstly, there is no existing refinery, not even the new state-of-the-art Mackay refinery, which is to be now operated by Mackay Sugar with Mann, that can support a sustained entry into the refined sugar export market. Secondly, it was only through the creation of a merged identity such as the proposed merger between CSR, Mackay Sugar and E.D. and F. Mann that the necessary critical mass could have been achieved for Australia to become a permanent exporter of value added refined sugar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was all pointed out to the Trade Practices Commission which decided to downplay it. The determination of the Trade Practices Commission has cut Australia out of entering a new export market, that of refined sugar&mdash;a growing market compared with the declining raw sugar market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real facts were pointed out to the Trade Practices Commission&mdash;realities that a long-term export business could only be established on a domestic production base involving more than one refinery. But there was a need for a sufficient and widespread domestic share to exist to provide a cushion against periods of low export returns due to the volatile nature of the refined sugar export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, when commercial realities dictated that these factors exist to establish a long-term export industry, the Trade Practices Commission thought it knew better. Against all evidence, it stated that the commission is not satisfied that there are likely to be any significant additional benefits attributable to the proposed new co-joint venture which would not be achieved by the existing joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When time dictated that Mackay Sugar and Mann had to go ahead and no longer pursue the larger joint venture project, the Trade Practices Commission in a press release showed its commercial naivety by saying that, because the refinery was proceeding, it justified the commission's refusal to authorise the joint venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of this decision, all Australians will be deprived of the benefits of the export earnings from a major involvement in a $5 billion industry. By limiting us to the raw sugar export market, the decision is dictating that we must stay in the Stone Age of commodity trading. This decision is a matter of the TPC getting it wrong&mdash;totally wrong. The consequences are so severe and costly that the government should seriously re-examine whether the decision should stand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely this was a case where the government should have made strong representations. There was an issue of national interest involved which should have required some sort of strong specific representation from the government. All sides of politics know that we must increase our export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This week Senator McMullan, the Minister for Trade, is in Indonesia drumming up better access into the Australian-Indonesian market for Australian exporters. Yet, right on our doorstep Indonesia imports over 300,000 tonnes of refined sugar every year. Maybe Senator McMullan could have taken his order book out and written an order for some of that refined sugar if the venture was allowed to go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is one of the most efficient raw sugar producers in the world. We were the world's largest exporter of raw sugar last year. We produce about 4.3 million tonnes of raw sugar a year and export about 3.5 million tonnes. Yet we export only about 10,000 to 20,000 tonnes of refined sugar to the small South Pacific market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian industry could do the same sterling effort if it had been allowed to enter into the refined sugar export market. There was tremendous support for the project from all sources. All sectors of the industry: the growers, the millers, and the refiners supported it. It is a landmark case when we can get all three sectors of industry supporting something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many large buyers expressed support for the merger and were disappointed that it has been blocked. These major buyers included Cadbury Schweppes, Nestles, Arnotts and Kelloggs. Buyers gave overwhelming support for the benefits of an efficient rationalisation of the refined sugar industry which, at the same time, would create national economic benefit through the development of value added exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government and the Queensland department of primary industry gave their full support. I ask: what has happened to the full support given by the Queensland Premier, Mr Goss, and the primary industry minister, Mr Ed Casey, now that the project has floundered? The support also extended to all relevant government departments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ABARE saw the benefit to the Australian raw sugar industry from Australia entering the refined sugar export market. In answer to my question, Senator Schacht told the Senate that his department, the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, closely considered the joint venture and concluded that the application was likely to result in a significant increase in real value of exports, the fostering of business efficiency and rationalisation resulting in more efficient allocation of resources. Government policy clearly encourages value adding to our primary products and increased downstream processing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC decision was extremely narrow in the attention given to public benefit. I am sure that all Australians would wish to see us enter a new export market as a major player rather than have a short-term concern about whether sugar prices temporarily went down, when they are capped by the import parity price anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic price is set by the import parity price. I have told the Senate many times about the corrupt world price of sugar set by the massive subsidy schemes in the US, the EU and other major sugar producers. How did the TPC know better than the contrary view of all the other experts about the potential benefit of entering a new export industry?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TPC was also clearly wrong in one of its main determinations that enhanced sugar exports are likely to occur with or without the joint venture. The TPC said that because Mackay Sugar was committed to building the refinery and had a joint venture arrangement with E.D. and F. Mann, it could do the same job in entering the export market as the joint venture between Mackay, Mann and CSR would have achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mackay Sugar knows what it is able to do, but did the TPC listen to that? The commission said that Mackay Sugar's present arrangement is neither able nor intending to develop a sustained export business for refined sugar. Surely the company knows more about its intended and possible actions than the Trade Practices Commission based in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The export market available to a refinery operated by such a strong merger as that proposed between Mackay Sugar, Mann and CSR was right for our entry. It has now been lost. The timing was just right for Australia's entry as a front runner. The world's raw sugar market is a declining market, whereas the refined sugar export market is expanding and vigorous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision of the Trade Practices Commission in this instance is nothing short of a tragedy for Australia and North Queensland. As shadow minister for northern Australia, it is also a tragedy for the sugar industry, which provides a strong economic basis for coastal Queensland. It was a project consistent with present government emphasis on regional development that would strengthen the sugar communities of Queensland. This decision has cost every canegrower around $3,000 a year, according to ABARE. It has cost the rationalisation of the refining industry and the upgrading of facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a statutory body to be able to prevent an opportunity to enter the growing refined sugar export market is a national folly. It is said that opportunity knocks but once. It may be that this was the case. A perfect opportunity existed for Australia to enter the export industry with the advantages of a state-of-the-art refinery, superior technology of the Bibo shipping and critical mass for the merger to expand production sufficient to enter a market hugely corrupted by subsidies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This sort of narrow decision making that defies all other evidence and support must not be allowed to happen ever again. The ultimate cost, the loss of the involvement of a new export industry of $5 billion, is too much of a price to pay for Australia. All wisdom does not reside in the commissioners. There is no way they can always grasp the specifics of the industry and the markets they are dealing in. It is obvious that they did not hear and they got it totally wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must listen to the valid complaints of industry about decision making by the Trade Practices Commission, which expends enormous time and resources on educating commissioners about the industry and its condition. This bad, wrong and backward decision points to flaws in the make-up of the commission, which must be addressed by the government. Issues brought to the commission are enormously complex and cover an extensive range. The Trade Practices Commission should be treated the same way as the Industry Commission, with specialist commissioners who have an expertise and knowledge of the industry under examination. Also this sort of representation should extend to the successor to the Trade Practices Commission, the National Competition Commission, as proposed by the adopted Hilmer report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a sad day to have to stand and address the Senate on a successful new export earning industry being lost to the nation&mdash;an opportunity lost by the decision of a body, the Trade Practices Commission, which in the opinion of a majority of the industry, manufacturers and government departments is wrong and contrary to the future long-term benefit of the Australian economy. Unfortunately, we have seen an opportunity lost. It cannot be pursued now because both the CSR and Mackay Sugar are pursuing their own marketing agendas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat, Australia can never again afford to be placed in a position where it loses an export industry that possibly would have been worth half a billion dollars with all the jobs that could have entailed for regional Australia and all the development that would have occurred as a result of that decision. I am totally surprised that the government, and some of the ministers who have some influence on the Trade Practices Commission, allowed this to occur. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak in this appropriation debate on the inadequacy with which Australia has been dealing with a number of natural disasters and specifically with the disaster of bushfire. For a number of years the Democrats, and, long before that, some of us in the conservation movement, have been strongly promoting the proposal that Australia should buy a fleet of Canadair water scooping aircraft which can pick up six tonnes of water in 10 seconds while in flight and can deliver that water to fires extremely quickly&mdash;indeed, a lot more quickly than any other aircraft available anywhere in the world.</PARA></TALK.START>

The proposals we put to government in relation to our budget proposals, which went to government earlier this week, are that in view of the expense of this aircraft it should be multi-tasked. It should be given a number of roles so that the bush firefighting role is only one role and, therefore, the costs of the aircraft for firefighting are reduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever we have made these proposals we have found repeatedly that there has been an objection to the purchase and the use of this aircraft on the grounds of a CSIRO study done in the early 1980s&mdash;namely, Project Aquarius. I want to lay to rest the claims that Project Aquarius was anything but a charade. It was a badly based, totally inadequate study and one which should not be given any further credibility in relation to the assessment of this aircraft. The Aquarius study was started in the early 1980s by the federal government with an amount of $3.2 million. It was hailed as Australia's most comprehensive investigation into bushfires.

In fact, during the whole of the experimental time, only five flights of the DC6B leased from the Canadian fire bombing company, Connair, were completed. In approximately 1985, Dr John Nicholsen, in an article written by science reporter Zena Armstrong, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only five fires on three of the 16 blocks had been conducted and none of them were of sufficient intensity for any significant results. A combination of too much rain and below average temperatures in January had failed to dry out the blocks sufficiently. We were hoping for fires that had a fire danger index of 30, but none of fires that we were able to conduct reached an index of more than five or six and were easily contained by hand crew. South Australian fires in 1983 had an index of about 100 we have so little data, we cannot draw any conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA>I want to underscore that because that is a fair summary of the conclusions of project Aquarius on which so much of the damning indictment of the use of the Canadair CL215 as it was, CL415 as it is now, are based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only research of any value to come from the work on Project Aquarius included that by Dr Graham Budd of Sydney University on firefighter stress, and some work done by Chisholm Institute of Technology under a subcontract undertaken by Mr David Packham. Packham's work included the development of the computer ASM1 model, which is designed to simulate fire suppression for a given fire and a given set of parameters. Other work by Packham included firefighter's clothing and some useful research conducted by Andrew Wilson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the best of my knowledge, no further analysis of the limited data gathered in Western Australia or South Gippsland has ever been undertaken, and that must be underscored. It is believed that, in addition to the $3.2 million originally allocated, the federal government assigned a further $1.5 million, and it is also believed that a further allocation was made from CSIRO internal funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It can be said that the report is an expensive computer simulation exercise, exclusive to the then Forests Commission of Victoria now called Conservation and Natural Resources. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This study has concentrated on the state of Victoria, but the model can be developed to other areas.</PARA>
<PARA>This was an extensive computer model exercise. Although some Country Fire Authority data was used, the study virtually concentrated on forest firefighting, both aerial bombing and fire-line construction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the major problems facing the report is that it has failed to identify and deal with the relationship between forest fires, bushfires and wild fires. The report on page 14 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1981, the former Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser requested the CSIRO to "Evaluate the Aerial Suppression of Bush Fires". However, all the practical experiments were conducted in forests, both in Western Australia and South Gippsland, including both aerial suppression and fire crew experiments.</PARA>
<PARA>As already mentioned, the practical data were useless for the purpose, and this study became a computer simulation study entirely. There are three distinct environments where fires can have an effect: forests, native bushland in the form of national parks, and the urban fringe bushland interface. As we saw during the New South Wales bushfires, by far the greatest losses occur in, and public attention is on, the urban fringe area&mdash;interfaces such as the Adelaide Hills and the Blue Mountains, as we saw in the recent fires. The report failed completely to adequately address firefighting requirements in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Forest firefighting operations are, in most cases, poles apart from fighting fires on farmland and urban fringe areas. The report has, in the main, only provided for forest fire suppression by aircraft and hand-crew. Forests are managed by formally trained and academically qualified professionals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Foresters protect identifiable and quantifiable assets. This is obvious in the report. In discussing losses due to fires, the report has 27 pages covering in great detail timber losses, contrasted with 21 pages for water, nine pages for national parks, six for bee-keeping, four for human casualties, three for property loss and two for nutrients. On page 4 the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">losses were estimated. . . from the limited information available.</PARA>
<PARA>Forest research abounds; it can be said with reasonable certainty that the majority of bushfire research has come directly from forest research establishments or individual forest research scientists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report refers on several occasions to a full analysis of data released through the National Bushfire Research Unit which is headed by Mr Cheney. To the best of my knowledge, little if any data from either Western Australia or Gippsland experiments has ever been fully or further analysed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Joe Landsberg, who was head of forest research at CSIRO, told a House of Representatives Standing Committee on Conservation and Environment on 21 October 1983:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When I say Aquarius is coming to an end that statement needs a little enlargement. The active research program involved in Aquarius is coming to an end. I think that before we moved on seriously or before we even jumped up and down and screamed about wanting more money, we would need to spend several years&mdash;it will take as long as that&mdash;ensuring that all of the data accumulated in the course of project Aquarius has been analysed. We are using systems, as always in so much modern research; this stuff pours off a computer in digital form and disappears into magnetic tapes.</PARA>
<PARA>The report is seriously flawed, with assumptions, estimates and guesstimates abounding. By the author's own admission:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The (computer simulation) model AIRPRO, is large and complex, it abounds with rough approximations and simplifications of even more complex reality. The rough approximations are indeed very rough.</PARA>
<PARA>In the reports the words such as assumed, assumption, preferred assumption, simplest assumption, extreme assumptions, implicitly assumed, and assuming occur no less than 138 times. Estimate, estimated, underestimated, overestimated, rough estimate, broad estimate, economic estimates, and estimation occur 109 times in this report. And average, averaged and rough average occur 67 times. It really beggars one's imagination to believe that so much reliance has been placed on this study when it comes to the serious matter of the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been lost in our bushfires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the model structure, many of the data are subject to considerable uncertainly. There could be a divergence between the data used in the model and actual values in future years which could have a significant effect on the results, but it has not been possible to define the quantitative confidence limits. Yet again on page 35 under `Data Limitations' we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Qualification of all aspects of the fire suppression process is the essence of this study, but at the outset reservations about the accuracy of the data and the relationships involved should be made quite clear. In parts it may appear to be an exercise in quantifying the unquantifiable.</PARA>
<PARA>There is a number of reasons for this data limitation. The natural processes involved in fire behaviour and effects are highly complex and variable over space and time. Even in the course of a single fire, there may be great variation in the environment, weather conditions, fire behaviour and effects, and suppression effectiveness. In addition, this economic study concerned with a long time span and large regions of Australia face greater variability on the broader scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wide variability in the economic environment also makes it difficult to place consistent values on the effect of a given resource change. Because of these problems, research studies quantifying the factors are relatively few, covering only a small part of the full range of situations and variables ideally required. Official reporting of actual fires is often scanty. Many agencies' fire report forms did not provide space for all items of interest and often items that are on the form are not filled in comprehensively by informants. Not surprisingly when one is dealing with a bushfire, one is less concerned with filling in forms than with fighting the fire. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all the main factors, the best data that was reasonably available were used. Many gaps had to be filled in by interpolation, extrapolations and guesstimates based on qualitative judgments. Even when data were available for particular estimates, they frequently could not be used directly in the model because they were from an atypical situation. Ad hoc adjustments in the light of other information were therefore made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In seeking information, the importance of particular data items to the studies sometimes has to be traded off against the costs of acquiring them. Accordingly, the quality of the data varies through the model and there may appear to be detail in some parts that is not justified by a comparison with the rough estimates and assumptions in other parts. The model might be likened to a chain that is only as strong as the weakest link, and there were very many weak links in project Aquarius indeed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This means that there were two areas of serious error in the Airpro computer simulator model itself and in the data which was used to run the simulations. The economic report was completed in 1985, following the senior author's period of secondment, using the preliminary data available at the time. However, project Aquarius has, in a sense, been replaced by CSIRO's new national bushfire research unit and further analysis of the data gathered in the Project Aquarius field trials will be carried out by this unit&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having said all of the above, the "Summary &amp; Conclusions," including the qualifications, was published and distributed in December 1985. The Full Report, of nearly 300 pages, was not published until April 1986&mdash;5 months later, and for that period, the very incompetent and damaging report was used by fire authorities and governments alike as good reason for nil-action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This action, plus the uncertainties and bias of the report place it in the scurrilous at the very least, and libellous at the worst.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the time the full report began to circulate, the damage to the credibility of the CL215 had already been done, and no amount of criticism, reasoned or impassioned, could shake those who chose to ignore the benefits the aircraft could bring to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">REPORTING BIAS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the major reasons the CL215 failed in the computer simulation was the methods used for assigning fixed and variable costs to each aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset, (p10), the CL215 was considered to be a single purpose aircraft which meant that the very high capital costs (i.e. fixed costs), were assigned solely to fire fighting. This, of course, had the effect of making the "cost per load" very expensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the same time, (p10), helicopters and agricultural aircraft, (p9), had discounted fixed costs because "they had considerable alternative uses".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The fixed costs for the Thrush Commander were based on an average of only 8 days of very high fire danger per season. On p69, reference is made to Fire-Trail maintenance, and states "However, helicopters are the only suitable means of attack for this purpose as they can also be used for reconnaissance and transport. Half the fixed costs for small helicopters are already written off in the model for these non-suppression functions". What they have done is not incorrect, but it simply widens the bias against the CL215 and puts the performance of these aircraft at an unfair economic advantage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On P72, "The agricultural aircraft are all privately owned. Unlike the larger fixed wing planes, their primary use is not for fire bombing, but spraying weedicide, fertiliser, pesticide etc&mdash;doesn't the CL215 do this too?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a further reference, p74 . . . "helicopters have the advantage of being multi-purpose so that only part of the fixed costs need be counted towards fire bombing. This is again referenced on pp101/102.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whilst all the above assumptions have validity, they grossly disadvantage the CL215.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mention was made of the National Safety Council (pp74,79). For reasons known only to the authors, they state, p99, "For efficient resource use, rates should be based on the true underlying costs, and similarly a social cost-benefit study should use the true costs. However, some with very different rate structures (e.g. USDA, Defence, NSCA), were re-structured to a basis more comparable with others."  NSCA were used in the study, and we all now know that rates quoted by NSCA were grossly and criminally distorted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HOW THE COSTS WERE CALCULATED</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report does not clearly state how some of the costs for aircraft were derived.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">P97 states "Details of airtanker costs for aircraft of interest to Australia were sought from several agencies and companies, overseas and in Australia. . . " Canadian standby rates tended to be two or three times higher than US rates in the same model; this may be due to the use of newer aircraft, more rigorous back-up requirements, and/or less competition in Canada. It is common knowledge that the US airtanker business, which is a billion dollar a year operation, is based on cheap, military surplus aircraft&mdash;why wasn't this mentioned?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On p100, special attention is paid to the CL215. When the Manitoba Department of Natural Resources quoted full cost per hour, the rates calculated by the authors was considerably more, so they presumed that the Manitoba DNR had omitted certain hidden costs "as is commonly the case with government accounting systems."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the report the life of a CL215 is shown as 18 years maximum. Early models are topping 20 years of active service, and are due for re-furbishment and a further 10 years minimum service life.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the variable costs, they did not at any time approach Canadair for any costs. It would appear that they took the variable rate as quoted in the tender for the hire of aircraft for Project Aquarius which is grossly unfair. This information was provided on the basis of a specific, one-off assignment, which has been used in generalised form for feeding into the computer simulation model.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is known that the costs for the successful aircraft were extremely favourable. Dr John Nicholson, the project co-ordinator, at the briefing, stated "We got the DC6 for a U-beaut, rock bottom price, from Connair", a direct competitor to Canadair. This must surely mean that the costs assigned to the DC6 have been artificially down-costed. Both the fixed and variable costs for the canadair have been distorted so as to unfairly represent the aircraft to the Australian scene.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">HIRE RATES</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Based on the statements made on p98, it is quite feasible that the CL215 was eliminated from some of the simulations. The report states "in some of the Canadian hire rates the standby rate per day is typically around 2.5 times the rate per flying hour. . . . . . Where a charge per flying hour is so high as to recover a significant part of fixed as well as variable costs, less efficient use of aircraft may result. The fire fighting agency paying the bill may be reluctant to dispatch even in situations where it could save enough to cover variable costs. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">(It would be a brave, (or foolish), fire commander in charge of a major fire, who would hold back a fire fighting tool because he thought it would cost too much)</EMPHASIS> . . . Similarly, in the AIRPRO model, such aircraft might not pass preliminary tests based on variable costs". No information in the report indicated which aircraft, if any were eliminated, but undoubtedly the CL215 would be at the top of the list, based on distorted and inaccurate costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to note that in the discussion on airtanker costs, pp97-105, special attention is paid to the CL215, RAAF Hercules and Helicopters, but no reference whatsoever is made to the DC6B&mdash;why not?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In further pressing the case that the CL215 has been unfairly costed out, the report on p104, states "Controlling oil spills has been another use for airtankers being seriously investigated by the Federal Government." It goes on to say "if a financial commitment by the government department concerned with oil spills were to be made, it could provide a useful contribution to defraying costs of airtankers. Agricultural aircraft have a natural advantage in regard to multiple use. This is a classic alternative use for the CL215 or its new cousin, the CL415.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DATA INPUT TO AIRPRO</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A second, major reason why the CL215 failed the various simulations is directly related to drop patterns and drop heights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The participants in Project Aquarius at no time contacted Canadair for professional or technical information. The footprints (i.e. the pattern left on the ground when the airtanker drops its load), for airtankers entered into the AIRPRO model, and for that matter the ASM1 model, were provided by the US Forest Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The US Forest service has always evaluated the CL215 as a retardent delivery system; the tank and gating system for the CL215 has been optimised, by design, for the delivery of water in the first instance, and fire fighting foam, which is now the normal load delivery for all Canadair aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This evaluation has two serious disadvantages for the CL215 and CL415.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the "User Guide-lines for Fire Retardent Aircraft: General Instructions Manual" issued by the US Forest Department states that a two compartment salvo drop should be avoided at heights of less than 200 feet. The Greek airforce laughed at this restriction stating that they regularly drop at 30-50 feet.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason for this is that gum-thickened retardents, used in very large quantities in the USA, have high viscosities, and are resistant to the break-up of the load. For this reason the mass tends to be more cohesive, retains its forward momentum longer and has velocity at impact.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the CL215 and 415 are not particularly favourable retardent delivery vehicles, but there is nothing available that can out-perform them for water or foam application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, computer footprints for the CL215 used in Project Aquarius were simulated using drop heights of 200 feet. This in turn gave a distorted result of the efficiencies of the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is most interesting to note, that at the same time Project Aquarius was using computer simulations, Petawawa National Forestry Institute undertook actual fire tests to examine the productivity of Skimmer Air Tankers (Petawawa National Forestry Institute, Information Report PI-X-15). For drop heights of 30 metres, footprints for a number of skimmer aircraft were determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be noted that Project Aquarius (p2), stated that with fires over 3000kW/m a retardant drop would eventually be nullified, whilst with fires up to 5000 kW/m retardant attack can achieve some temporary reduction in fire intensity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Petawawa tests revealed that the maximum intensity that was controlled by a CL215 was 3335 kW/m for white spruce, 5000 kW/m for jack pine, 6000 kW/m for black spruce and 8335 kW/m for Balsam fir. <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">These tests were conducted using actual slash burns of measurable intensity, and the findings are in stark contrast with the "assumptions" in the economic model.</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FIRE FIGHTING FOAMS</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of fire fighting foams is considered by fire fighting authorities to at least double, or even treble the effectiveness of water, and this being the case, and depending on the type of vegetation dealt with, intensities of up to 24000 kW/m could be effectively dealt with by the Canadair aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">INTEGRATED FIRE MANAGEMENT</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A further reason why the CL215 was failed by the Project Aquarius tests was that the AIRPRO computer model considered each aircraft as a separate entity. P202 states "The model itself tests each type of resource independently, rather than comparing different combinations of resources, either working together on a fire or in the fleet available for dispatch to any fire. Those aircraft with negative net savings may be eliminated from further consideration but the question remains as to what combinations of those resources with positive savings should maximise total savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of Canadair aircraft to fire fighting operations in each of the countries which operate the aircraft has never been on the basis of "This is the only fire fighting tool you will need". Indeed, CL215's and 415's are an integral part of fire fighting operations, both land based and in combination with other aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To use a computer simulation, which has yet to put out an actual fire, in isolation is like to sending a single fire truck and crew to put out a major bush fire! The model can have no validity if it does not consider how effective aerial fire fighting is in the context of the true role in the overall extinguishment of the fire, and the functions of the essential elements in the suppression formula.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Hill says, it was a total vindication of me. The Prime Minister has claimed this investment to be `an outstanding one', `in Australia's best interests' and `a marvellous, wonderful, pure and beautiful thing'. Anyone who attacked it was in fact `attacking primary industry and Australia's future' rather than attacking a shonky deal based on rotten figures which falsely alleged this group was profitable and financially strong. Investors overseas were misled about the strength of this group. Danish directors of Danpork said&mdash;no doubt innocently&mdash;when trying to convince reluctant Danish farmers that their cooperatives should become involved in this project, that they were going into a deal with a financially strong Australian piggery and wholesaling group. That was false; the figures were false. At no stage has this company, this group of the Prime Minister's, ever made a profit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These false declarations would have remained there had it not been for my diligence and perseverance and my standing up to a campaign of personal vilification for two years for daring to criticise this `perfect' Prime Minister, who is so good at dishing it out but simply cannot cop it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at this.

I move to today's announcement by the Prime Minister that he had `disposed' of his piggery interests so ending his role in an $80 million joint venture with a Danish multi-national. This disposal creates more political problems for the Prime Minister than it solves. Disposal may have saved his financial skin by getting out of a disastrous investment in a loss-making venture that was incapable of ever making a profit&mdash;particularly if interest rates are to move upwards again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly, who bought it and on what terms? This is the key point, and if the minister would shut his mouth and open his ears, even he might understand. If this is no longer viable, how did Mr Keating manage to dispose of it? Who would buy something that is unviable according to Mr Keating's goons who are roaming the corridors? This raises major questions that he must answer, no matter how embarrassing it is for him. He is not off the political hook, even if he has been saved from the financial hook, because this humiliating withdrawal involves the potential for a massive conflict of interest. That is why he has to reveal the details of the manner in which he has disposed of this obligation that he had entered into.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from the question which has been raised by some people about how he found $430,000 on a parliamentarian's salary to go into this in the first place, the simple question remains: how much did he get for disposing of this enormous burden which was not viable and could not be? To whom did he dispose of it? What happened to the obligations to the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, entered into by this group when Mr Keating was the Treasurer? What has happened to the guarantees, if any? If he disposed of it to foreigners, is there any FIRB approval required? Let us face it, Mr Keating changed the rules in 1992 so maybe there is no FIRB approval required. But we do not know that. There are so many vital questions relating to the potential for conflict of interest that they just must be answered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Mr Keating has been rescued from this unviable operation by someone, I wonder how grateful he must be. Fancy a Prime Minister putting himself in a situation where he is rescued from an unviable operation in which he has invested $430,000&mdash;an operation which is massively in debt as well, by the way, by $4.5 million on a subordinated loan to a lobbyist. All these things were revealed only because of my diligence in the face of continual, contemptible personal attack by the government. If Mr Keating is under such a massive obligation to his rescuer, what a very worrying potential for conflict of interest there is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine there are many people in Australia who would love the Prime Minister to be under that kind of obligation to them; many people who want changes in the law to improve their capacity to own assets or their capacity to increase the proportion of their holdings in various matters. Indeed, there are many people who would like the Prime Minister to be under that kind of obligation to them. That is why it is vital that he lets the public know what the truth is about his disposal of this interest. If he will not do so, there should and must be some kind of inquiry. This failed Treasurer, the man who brought us the recession we had to have, is now a failed businessman, too. This failed Treasurer has exposed himself to the risk of being under a massive obligation to people who may well seek to have him under that kind of obligation&mdash;a crazy situation for a Prime Minister to ever get himself into. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, there must be full revelation of this matter. I admit it would be unusual for the Prime Minister to be involved in a revelation about anything, because when he bought this operation he did not meet the cabinet rules. He did not tell his Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, as he was required to do, what this investment was or the value of it. He never told Mr Hawke&mdash;and I know that for a fact. Mr Hawke has been quite happy to reveal the nature of the conversations he had with Paul Keating on this matter, and it did not include revelation of the facts while Mr Hawke was Prime Minister and Mr Keating was Treasurer. And it should be remembered he bought this investment while he was Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose he is keeping up this reputation for non-revelation. He did not admit to the parliament that he had a half ownership, and so on. Everyone knows the sordid story. He did not get around to correcting the forms that were filled in and sent to the Australian Securities Commission, saying this investment was a $43,000 investment, to show that it was a $430,000 investment. There have been non-stop misrepresentations and lies about this investment from the very beginning. There have been failures to report. No-one will be surprised to know that even though Mr Keating says he disposed of these interests a fortnight ago, there are no documents with the Securities Commission yet which indicate any change whatsoever in the ownership of these interests. I doubt that we will ever get a straightforward report. No doubt I will have to keep up the same sort of devilling inquiry to establish whether or not our Prime Minister is under some obligation to someone, to find out who that person is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure the government I will maintain this pursuit. I assure the government this is not the end of the book; it is only the end of the chapter. So much stinks in this operation&mdash;and it is not just the pigs&mdash;that it must and will be uncovered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the sort of nonsense that the Prime Minister went on with&mdash;that the reason he got out was that he did not want to subject the partners in this business to the unprincipled taunts of an unprincipled opposition which were affecting the business, its prospects and all other questions which come along. It was not the opposition that began and held the inquiry into the expansion program at Scone; it was the New South Wales government, which had been a strong supporter of the proposal, as Mr Keating has been so keen to demonstrate so often by quoting Mr Greiner. It was the New South Wales government which, under the law, was obliged to have an inquiry, and that fair inquiry required some restraints and restrictions on that project that rendered it unviable. So here we have once again Mr Keating looking around for someone to smear, someone to attack, someone to criticise, because he made a boo-boo. He was a drongo; he was a business incompetent; he was conned by some people who have showed him a set of false accounts and he could not tell the difference. </PARA>

Let us deal with that lie. Let us look at fact No. 1: Baume forced the revelation through audited accounts that the profitability claimed for this piggery group was false and that it had suffered a huge loss. These false claims have resulted in Danpork directors wrongly telling the Danish public, and farmer shareholders, that their Australian partner was financially strong. It never has been and it does not look as though it ever will be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact: Baume revealed the problems Mr Keating's partner, to whom he entrusted the running of his piggery, had with abiding by the Corporations Law which he has habitually broken. That partner is Mr Al Constantinidis, a habitual breaker of the Corporations Law, as I have established here over and over again.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact: Baume revealed that the Prime Minister's investment in his piggery was a huge $430,000, not the $43,000 falsely reported to the ASC and reported in the media, with no denial from Mr Keating. Fact: Baume revealed that the Prime Minister's companies owed lobbyist Mr John Brown $4.5 million, a fact Mr Keating's companies have dishonestly sought to conceal or diminish. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact: the inquiry into the Prime Minister's piggery group that Baume forced on the Australian Securities Commission resulted in the revelation that five of the seven Brown and Hatton piggery group were technically insolvent, with liabilities exceeding assets, and were able to continue only due to support from the Commonwealth Bank of Australia&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;and their ultimate shareholders, Messrs Keating and Constantinidis, although we did not ever find out what guarantees, if any, either of them put up. </PARA>

Since then, of course, their loans have gone up because they have lost so much more money, they have had to borrow more to keep going.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fact: Baume exposed the dishonest nature of a letter to the Securities Commission from Mr Keating's partner, Mr Constantinidis, in which he blamed previous directors for filing inaccurate annual returns which in fact Mr Constantinidis himself had filed with the Securities Commission.

It is fascinating, is it not? When I say to him, `Demonstrate where I was wrong. Produce one document to demonstrate that I have been wrong', not one document has been presented.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Turning to the first point, I bring to the Senate's attention that negotiations are under way tonight in Geneva which I believe could have an effect on sections of Australian industry. Most senators, I think I am fair in saying, would not be aware that in 1989 Australia was one of the earlier countries to sign the Basel Convention on the control of trans-boundary movements of hazardous wastes and their disposal&mdash;Senator Coulter may be as he takes a great interest in these matters. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not quite the bandwagon that I think Senator Coulter may be predicting. There would be no argument in this chamber that the transfer of hazardous waste should be closely monitored to protect the environment. The Basel Convention was also rightly aimed at preventing the dumping of toxic wastes in sites in developing countries. Unfortunately, the Basel Convention does not adequately distinguish between, on the one hand, hazardous waste destined for disposal, and, on the other hand, materials which are by-products and secondary raw materials which are destined for recovery, recycling, use in other production processes and further refining. These materials, as I hope Senator Coulter would agree, are not wastes, but valuable recyclables and raw materials for a large number of industries both in Australia and internationally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian trade in these materials is worth around $2 billion a year in exports of metals, plastics, paper, cardboard and metal concentrates, to mention just a number. A portion of this Australian export trade is directed to developing countries within our neighbouring Asian-Pacific region, including Malaysia which has world class recycling facilities. This export trade is currently at risk as a result of a proposal by Denmark to amend the Basel Convention to ban the export to non-OECD countries of hazardous wastes, which unfortunately would also involve banning the export of recoverables. Any unnecessary risk to this trade in recyclables would, I believe, work against the principles of ecologically sustainable development by jeopardising regional initiatives in waste minimisation, cleaner production and resource conservation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following questions which I and Senator Troeth put to Senator Evans in Estimates Committee A last Friday, the foreign minister tabled a document which set out the principles guiding Australia's position in the Basel Convention negotiations. This document does give some hope that the government will pursue a responsible approach from an environmental and economic perspective. The document states that Australia will not accept trade restrictions or prohibitions on safe recoverables such as paper, plastic, textiles and some bulk-traded scrap metals. The document also makes clear that the government would oppose any kind of ban proposed by Denmark that would clearly damage legitimate Australian trade in recyclables which, in the government's own words, does not damage the environment and may even bring environmental benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the government's attempt to achieve a balanced perspective on this issue, there is a real chance that a vote will be taken tonight to bring into effect a ban on hazardous exports which include recyclables to developing countries, and that Australia will find itself isolated on this issue. One may well ask why European countries and others are taking such a relaxed interest in this issue. I believe there is a justifiable suspicion that they are more concerned about protecting the competitiveness of their own domestic industries compared with the emerging highly competitive recycling industries in other countries. It is vital that we distinguish here between genuine environmental concerns and hidden protectionist motivations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will raise one further concern. I note that the leader of the Australian delegation has been elected to the position of chairman of the negotiating conference. At a time when the protection of Australia's national interests leads it potentially to be isolated in its negotiating stance, it is unclear to me why Australia should seek a position which could have the effect of restraining the vigorous pursuit of our interests. I hope I am proven wrong. This issue is being watched, not only by senators, but also by Australian industry and those who do not welcome the use of UN conventions to confine the legitimate interests of this nation so that other nations can pursue their own self-interest. I will be interested to see the results of the negotiations in Geneva, and to see whether the delegation has been able to ensure that the interests of this nation are protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter I wish to raise with the Senate this evening concerns the budget proposals that have been brought down by the Australian Democrats. Senators will recall that the government has invited Senator Kernot and her colleagues to take part in the budget negotiations. I think this is a mistake. It is the first mistake of the budget. I think it is a mistake from the government's point of view, and I suspect that in the end it will be seen to be a mistake from the point of view of the interests of the Democrats themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one sups with the government, one is drawn into endorsing aspects of the budget which may, in the fullness of time, turn out to be to the detriment of the Australian economy. I think three alternative budget proposals have been brought down in the last three years. On each of those occasions, the Australian Democrats have called for a very substantial increase in taxation. Senator Coulter, who is in the chamber, would not dispute that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Coulter thinks we are a low tax country. I think Senator Coulter is wrong, but I have to say that Senator Coulter is honest, as distinct from the government. I have to give it to the Australian Democrats that they have constantly argued for higher taxes so that they can be distributed in ways that suit them. The Democrats, in fairness, have not hidden their policies about calling for an increase in taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first danger is that the policies of the Australian Democrats give the government, which is desperate for revenue to cover its own spending plans and the huge deficit that its policies have left us with, an open invitation to this Senate and this parliament to bring forward higher taxes. The budget proposals put down by the Australian Democrats signal that the government will have little difficulty in getting these tax increases through this chamber because they will have the support of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stated objective of the Democrats' budget&mdash;I think I am citing the document fairly&mdash;is, in their own words, to repair the damage the recession caused and to make fundamental changes to the tax structure to favour long-term productive investment over speculation and debt. I believe the Democrats' budget will fail in its objectives. If it were implemented, in part or in full, it would slow economic recovery, discourage savings and leave Australia even more dependent on foreign investment. As my colleague the shadow Treasurer, Mr Downer, has said, the budget proposes job destroying tax increases. I believe all Senator Kernot and her colleagues have done is call for a further lift in taxation levels in this country. Any gains that the budget proposals of the Democrats may bring in terms of expenditure or other cuts in taxation will be more than offset by the additional tax burdens which the Democrats are calling on to be imposed on the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can all support such things as the removal of payroll tax, if it is done in a responsible manner. But what advantage, I ask Senator Coulter, would there be if we discourage business investment and employment by imposing higher company and income taxes? One of the fundamental structural problems in this country is the low level of savings. I think Senator Coulter would agree with that. Arguably, Australia has one of the lowest savings rates in the developed world. It certainly has a far lower savings rate than the so-called Asian tiger economies. This is why Australia is so dependent on overseas savings for its investment. </PARA>

The Australian community understands that, if this government is to bring in higher taxes, it is in a sense bringing them in at the invitation of Senator Coulter and his colleagues; and the government will reap the harvest of such proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxation measures proposed by the Democrats will, in total, discourage savings and investment. I am referring not only to the higher income taxes that are proposed but the fact that superannuation would become a significantly less attractive option. I am sure that Senator Watson, who is with us in the chamber, would agree with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to&mdash;using Senator Kernot's words&mdash;repair the damage of the recession, we need to encourage investment. On the contrary, I believe this proposal by the Australian Democrats, in total, will discourage enterprise and entrepreneurship in this economy. One example is company taxation. One of the few promises Mr Keating kept was to lower the rate of company taxation to 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Democrats' proposed budget there are a number of changes to company taxation. First, in this budget proposal the company taxation rate will be increased to 36 per cent. Second, there will be a minimum company tax rate of 20 per cent, which will raise a whopping $1,030 million. Make no mistake, this is a radical proposal which fundamentally changes the way the tax system operates. </PARA>

Is there not such a proposal?  Senator Coulter should keep calm; I am going to analyse this. We have established the facts, and what I was saying was correct. At present, companies are able to deduct such things as accelerated depreciation, 150 per cent for research and development, and of course investment allowances. All these have been put together to provide incentives for investment and are deductible against income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the Democrats are saying, in effect, is that these incentives should be reduced for companies that have been legally able to make use of these incentives and as a result pay less than 20 per cent company tax on the accounting profit. How many companies will share in this billion dollar tax burden? The Democrats said they were going to raise over a billion dollars from this taxation proposal. How many companies will find they have vastly higher tax as a result of this proposal?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that the Democrats want to encourage deductions for employment and reduce the research and development threshold but at the same time companies are slugged with this additional tax. It must also be remembered that any increase in company tax will affect business confidence and discourage investment, particularly at this delicate stage of the recovery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the issue of savings, which will again be savagely hit by the Democrat budget proposal. Reducing dividend imputation to 50 per cent will discourage investment by shareholders in Australian companies.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are now discussing the Democrats' alternative proposals. The problem is that the proposed changes to dividend imputation will have the effect of discriminating against companies or income generated through corporate structures, effectively increasing tax burdens on dividends from a maximum of 48.4 per cent to 64.9 per cent. At the same time, money from partnerships&mdash;maybe even piggeries&mdash;or any other trading arrangements remains at the maximum of 48.4 per cent. Why penalise the most widely recognised and arguably the most efficient trading entity, particularly if the government is concerned about encouraging investment? Mr Acting Deputy President, you will be aware that the savings of many Australians are now tied up in superannuation funds, in part by choice but in part because of the compulsory nature of superannuation which this government has insisted upon. </PARA>

Now that their money is in there, the superannuation funds are investing in Australian companies and picking up the imputed value of taxation on these dividends as an offset. These are very important to superannuation funds. Through this proposal, which Senator Murphy apparently agrees with and likes, the government is saying that it will be cutting savings of Australian workers. Senator Murphy will be standing up there and cheering this on.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be fair to the people who want to try to defend the Prime Minister. The government brought some poor public servants before an estimates committee to say that they had written the document, that they could not remember why they deleted the words at all but, even if they had deleted them, they were not quite sure that what was there was correct. They were sure that every paragraph in the minute was correct but they just could not work out whether those words were correct. I am sure that if I were a public servant who had been caught deleting words from an FOI document&mdash;it is an offence under the act to improperly delete information or to withhold information&mdash;I would be very embarrassed as well. I would get a very good case of selective amnesia and I would get it very quickly. Unfortunately, Mr Keating already had the selective amnesia when he required the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to print the retraction. The retraction the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> was made to print was nothing but a lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, through the retraction, the Prime Minister suggested that the joint venture vehicle had not been in contact with the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. That is also very interesting, because a fax from Austrade in Copenhagen in November 1990 reports that the fourth Australian visit by the Federation of Danish Industries&mdash;which became Danpork&mdash;was a great success and that `technical, principally quarantine, issues are resolved'. They were resolved. They were obviously resolved to the satisfaction of the Danes and their punitive partners because that is why they continued with the process. The fax said that Danpork was ready to invest in the Australian project and that the manager had returned from Australia, where he had negotiated with potential investors. I assume that one of those potential investors was Mr Keating, or interests associated with him, because not much later Mr Keating finally disclosed to the world that he had a joint venture interest in this company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time we saw frantic work by AQIS to start to review the import protocols for genetic material from Denmark. If the Prime Minister likes to believe that by selling his shares&mdash;or rather by disposing of his shares, because we do not know how the shares in the company were disposed of&mdash;he absolves himself from the sins of forcing the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> to print a retraction which was a total and utter travesty of the truth from start to finish, he is wrong. If Mr Keating thinks that he can buy into a joint venture company, hold on to it, maybe make a profit, or maybe get out breaking even, or maybe get out thankful to whoever it was who was his benefactor who bought the shares&mdash;</PARA>

He knew that through his influence he could ensure that the situation was fixed so that his joint venture partners and his own company would have a clear run. They would get this genetic material, they would breed these super pigs and the rules would be fixed. All the documents show it.

If he thinks that ministerial incompetence or ministerial misconduct can be so easily hidden from this parliament, he is very wrong. I can assure Mr Keating that we have the documents. I can assure Mr Keating that we know exactly what has gone on, that we are continuing to work on Mr Keating's misconduct and that all will be revealed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to talk about the large amounts of money that are paid to state and local governments out of the appropriation. At this time of year that leads me to say a few brief words about local government elections in Queensland this Saturday. Yesterday, in matters of public interest, I raised the question of the lies yet again being told by the Labor Party in its advertising in the campaign for the Townsville City Council. I pointed out that these lies and things were typical of the Labor Party when it came to electioneering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tonight the Labor Mayor of Townsville, Alderman Tony Mooney, is absolutely desperate to retain power. He knows, in the last couple of days before the campaign, that he is about to be beaten. He wants to retain power for as long as he can, because he has been promised in a factional deal up there that he can take the state seat of Geoff Smith. Geoff Smith will be shuffled aside and Tony Mooney, providing he can remain as mayor, will take over that state seat. But he is about to lose his position as mayor, and he knows it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators do not have to take my word that he is about to lose his position as mayor. I want to read a few excerpts from a letter that appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Townsville Daily Bulletin</EMPHASIS> yesterday under the heading `Workers speak out'. The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Townsville rail workers, whose future employment is unsure, we were heartened to read of the liberal's plan to encourage the building of significant workshops in the Brook Hill area, which would replace both the north and south yards workshops.</PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mayor Tony Mooney unfortunately agrees with his Brisbane-based mates, so he remains silent, while workers face a bleak future. . . </PARA>
<PARA>The end of the letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But all is not lost, as nothing has started yet, so all we need is a council of independents and Liberals who will fight for Townsville's rights and tell premier Goss that the `marshmallow Mooney' days are finished.</PARA>
<PARA>That letter is signed by railway workers in Townsville. They are the sort of people whom Senator Burns pretends to represent. So the railway workers of Townsville are telling the Labor Party that it is finished. In division 1 of the Townsville City Council a railway worker is running for the Liberal Party and another railway worker is running as an Independent. They know that the Labor Party has given them away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor mayor is so desperate at the moment that he is running around to the media tonight saying, `I'm going to report Senator Macdonald for writing to his constituents in Townsville on his official letterhead'. That is what he is saying. Big deal! He is going to report me for writing to my constituents in Townsville. I wrote to my constituents in Townsville to tell them about the sports rorts affair&mdash;the Kelly whiteboard&mdash;the sandwich shop fiasco and how the Labor Party wants to abolish the Senate. I also told them that, while all this is happening down here, Townsville's unemployment queues continue to grow. Almost 9,000 people in Townsville are now unemployed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I told them how the Mabo legislation had created two classes of Australians, with different laws and entitlements for each class. I told them about recent industrial relations legislation which will cripple small business and lead to even greater unemployment. I said, regrettably, that those Labor Party politicians who are supposed to lead our city of Townsville are remarkably silent about these vital issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the question: where was the opposition from those Labor aldermen and members in Townsville when the Labor Party legislated to increase fuel taxes by up to 7c per litre? I told those people, in my capacity as shadow minister for local government, that the council uses a lot of fuel and that it will have to collect more revenue to pay the additional federal taxes on fuel. I told the Townsville people that they were going to get slugged twice&mdash;once when they went to the petrol bowser and again when they paid their rates, because rates would have to go up to pay the increased federal taxes on fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what was contained in the letter which the Mayor of Townsville is so desperate to report me for. Do honourable senators know to whom he is going to report me? He could not even get that right. He has told the press that he is going to report me to the President. I tremble, waiting for the President to get his letter. That is how desperate the Mayor of Townsville is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This letter is fairly similar to a letter that Ted Lindsay, the Labor member for Herbert, just happened to write a couple of weeks ago. I hope that the Mayor of Townsville, when he complains to the President about my letter, does not mention the letter that Senator Colston wrote about the local authority election down in the shire of Albert, because that might be a little suspect. But I do not want to raise that. That goes far beyond what I want to do. But I just hope the Labor mayor does not mention that when he writes to the President. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to hold up the Senate too long, but I mention two other matters which are very good examples of the continuing way the Labor Party lies at election time. Here I have a brochure, put out by the Labor Party in division 2, which accuses the Liberal aldermen of doing certain things. First of all, it says that the Liberal aldermen did not vote for the lake stage 1. I can quote the minutes of the Labor council which show that the Liberal aldermen did vote for the lake stage 1. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pamphlet also says that the Liberal aldermen did not vote for rate capping for our senior citizens. The minutes of the council meeting in Townsville show that the Liberal aldermen did in fact vote for that. Two things alleged; two lies. This is the sort of material that the local government candidates are putting out, the same sorts of lies that the mob opposite told in the federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pamphlet goes on to say that the Liberal aldermen said when the residents of West End wanted shoulder sealing within two years that they would have to wait 20 years. Here again we have the minutes of the city council meeting which show that the Liberals actually voted for that shoulder sealing campaign. Everything the Labor Party has said in this pamphlet, and in most of its material, has been unmitigated, deliberate and deceitful lies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raise another matter. I started on the point that the Labor mayor was going to report me for writing to my constituents on my official letterhead. A couple of days ago the Labor Premier of Queensland came to Townsville. He got a pretty good reception. He was attending a $60 a head lunch for the Labor true believers, at a fairly substantial cost, at a very good restaurant in Townsville. As he and the Labor mayor, Alderman Tony Mooney, went to the lunch&mdash;great Labor men; $60 a head for their lunch&mdash;they were met by hundreds of railwaymen who do not have a job. They were standing there in the hot sun, hungry, because Goss and Mooney had put them out of work, while they flitted inside for a $60 a head luncheon. The railwaymen, without a job and without anything to eat, stood outside and made their problems known. This is the great party of the workers, the great party of the Labor men: $60 a head luncheons while the railwaymen without work stand outside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is fair enough. I suppose out of the $60 there was a bit for campaign funds. The invitation says that bookings should be made to a Carol Douglas on phone 254 166. I rang that number and guess whose number it is? It is the office of Ken Davies, the state Labor member for Townsville. He is organising a campaign function for Premier Goss and Mayor Mooney. One sends the $60 along, made out to the Townsville MEC. I do not know what MEC stands for&mdash;it could stand for anything&mdash;but I would have a bet that it might just stand for mayoral electoral campaign. Do those opposite think that is what it might stand for? So that is where the $60 goes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is fair enough. I suppose we all have to do that. But let us see how this thing was posted out. How did this invitation get to the good people of Townsville? Here I have a copy of the envelope. What is on the back of the envelope? `Legislative Assembly Queensland'. Would people think that perhaps that fundraising invitation had been sent out in envelopes provided for the members of the Queensland Legislative Assembly?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, here again we see the Labor Party at its best. We all experienced the campaign of outright lies and deceit in the federal election. In this chamber yesterday I pointed out that the Labor team in the Townsville City Council is doing exactly the same thing. Today I do some more of that. It is a pity that the Senate is not sitting tomorrow or later on today because we could do that yet again; it comes up all the time. Every day my office phone runs hot with people saying how disgraceful it is that the Labor Party should embark upon this sort of campaign, that it accuses me of using my letterhead, like Ted Lindsay and Margaret Reynolds, to write to constituents. It says that is terrible, when here it goes sending out campaign appeals and invitations in a letter from the Legislative Assembly from Mr Ken Davies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are lots of other things I could say, but I know my colleague Senator Tambling has some things to say before we finish this debate on the appropriations, so I will finish there. I do hope that the people of Townsville will understand the dirty tricks campaign and, as those railway workers have urged them to do, I am quite confident that on Saturday the people of my city will get rid of yet another Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue I wish to raise tonight is one that is very important to the appropriations and one which the Senate and everyone is entitled to take into account in dealing with this important legislation. During Senate Estimates Committee C, a number of issues were very properly raised. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will recall that there was quite a bit of discussion with regard to national infrastructure projects and, particularly, links to the better cities program. As a result of that information, and only in the last couple of days, I have received through Estimates Committee C 700 pages of tabled files on the particular issue that I addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This issue concerns very specifically the $8 million Subiaco oval upgrade in Western Australia. This was a particular project. Mr Acting Deputy President, I take you back to the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in February 1992. In February 1992, a commitment was given to $8 million worth of national highways and road funding in Western Australia. It was a very important project. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we subsequently found when we got to the August 1992 budget that there was a phone call from the Department of Finance to what is now called the Department of Human Services and Health requesting that department to introduce an $8 million, one-line item into its budget. It was very conveniently tacked away underneath the better cities program and everything else. There was no justification in the performance indicator statements of that project. It was appropriated, but it was not spent in 1992-93. It was not even looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the August 1993 budget, the same line item was again transferred into the 1993 project. Again, nothing appears in the performance indicator statements. Naturally, in looking at this year's estimates, it was a matter of asking some questions about how this funding was going to be expended and when it was going to be spent. We have now discovered that the $8 million will not be spent this financial year. Rather, $1.5 million of it will be spent in 1993-94 and the remainder in the next financial year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This naturally set my mind thinking that I needed to look further at this project. I asked questions of the officers in Estimates Committee C. Suddenly what started to unravel is a very incestuous and suspicious scandal that goes back to the involvement of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating; the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins; the then Premier of Western Australia, Dr Lawrence; Mr David Hatt, a consultant in Western Australia; and the portfolio minister involved with the Department of Human Services and Health, Mr Howe. All of these Labor mates are suspiciously caught up in a major scandal that has now unravelled in these 700 pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I invite people to go through these pages in detail. They now formally mean that a lot more questions are involved. This file evolved from a telephone conversation. In the August 1992 budget, the Department of Finance told the Department of Human Services and Health to introduce an $8 million line program. What is the justification for that? It is a letter that has now been tabled from Mr Dawkins, the then Treasurer, to the Prime Minister dated 27 July 1992. That letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may recall that in discussions I had with the Premier of Western Australia, the Hon Carmen Lawrence, prior to the One Nation Statement, it was agreed that $8 million from that package be held over, pending further consideration of infrastructure projects of benefit to the Western Australian community. When making this decision, we had in mind that the Hatt Report on the development of Subiaco Oval was then in its final stages of preparation.</PARA>
<PARA>Listen to this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For administrative convenience the $8 million in question were notionally included in the National Highway Systems program. However, the funds have not been allocated to any specific projects.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is my firm view that the most practical and beneficial application of these funds would be to the Subiaco Oval redevelopment project, as recommended in the Hatt report, it is my intention to hold further discussions with Premier Lawrence with a view to determining the final allocation of these funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, I am now writing to seek your agreement to designate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The third item in the file is a letter from the Prime Minister dated 2 August 1992. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My Dear John,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 27 July 1992 concerning funding for the redevelopment of Subiaco Oval. I agree that these funds be designated as a further separate appropriation under the category of Urban Infrastructure in the Health, Housing and Community Services Portfolio.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating.</PARA>
<PARA>There is the genesis; there is the start of this incredible saga that goes on for a whole series of departmental notes that show that the department was unhappy and had problems all the way through. It tried to pass off the responsibility to Mrs Kelly's department&mdash;sport&mdash;but that department threw it back saying, `No. We don't want anything to do with it. We won't have anything whatsoever to do with this particular project'. The intrigues, subterfuge, et cetera that have followed since then have to be read to be believed. I invite any journalist, senator or member of the public who wants to see how this Labor government has operated over a period of two years to come and get hold of those files. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This leads us to a series of questions that must be asked. The question we must ask the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, is: why did he approve, in August 1992, this mysterious transfer of $8 million from One Nation road funding to Subiaco Oval, a project very closely associated with the electorate confines and areas of Dr Carmen Lawrence?<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Did the former federal Treasurer, John Dawkins, reveal his personal links with Western Australian football when he took part in this deal? The Prime Minister needs to be asked whether he will order an inquiry into Mr Dawkins's motives and conduct, particularly if either he or Mr Hatt, one of Labor's mates, is appointed in the near future to either the Western Australian Football Commission, or the new Fremantle AFL club, as is widely predicted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister needs to be asked whether he will investigate Dr Lawrence's involvement in and compliance with this project. Honourable senators should see the statements in these files about Dr Lawrence's compliance with this. A Perth city councillor was so incensed at this issue that in one of the pieces of correspondence she says, `There is a certain odour to this not unreminiscent of the halcyon days of WA Inc'. The Prime Minister should also be asked now, today, to stand Dr Lawrence aside from any conflicting cabinet or ministerial appointments until this grubby and corrupt series of favours for mates has been fully investigated and explained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The portfolio minister, Mr Howe, needs to be asked: given that the Hatt report on the Subiaco Oval to the then Lawrence Labor government was completed only after the $8 million had been earmarked by the federal government under this special deal between Mr Dawkins and the Prime Minister, was this project determined on a whiteboard, or was it determined in secret discussions between the Labor mates, Mr Dawkins, Dr Lawrence and David Hatt? I remind West Australian senators who came here in March 1993 that the $8 million appropriation to the Subiaco Oval was promoted three days before that March federal election. Given that, why has Mr Howe failed now to reach an agreement with the Western Australian governments&mdash;both the labor government and the subsequent coalition government&mdash;in the two years since the One Nation statement of 1992?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Howe also needs to be asked about his 700  departmental files that he approved for release this week to the Senate Estimates Committee C, and the cover-up of some very revealing inter-office memoranda from his own department. For example, one officer describes the Subiaco saga as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Blue Hills</EMPHASIS>. Yet another asks for direction about the political clout associated with this project. Yet another asks, `Am I missing some of the more subtle reasons for the payments to be made this year . . . in advance of the need?'. Why is there a memo stating, `Carmen Lawrence is anxious about making too much of a public announcement about it'? Another memo cynically refers to her friend, David Hatt, author of the Hatt Report into Subiaco Oval, as a `man of many hats'. Will the minister explain this unholy, complicated mess in which the officers of his department, through 700 pages, are obviously uneasy with this total political cover-up?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Minister for Finance, Mr Beazley? This is another area. I certainly intend in this next parliamentary recess to make freedom of information requests to the other departments that are involved, the Department of Transport and the Department of Finance. I want to see the 700 pages that will come out of those departments; they will be just as revealing. But we need to ask Mr Beazley why his department asked Mr Howe's department in August 1992 `how the $8 million for the Subiaco Oval project was to be appropriated' when the then Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, had already told Carmen Lawrence `that he was prepared to advance Commonwealth money up front'&mdash;I stress up front&mdash;`for the Subiaco Oval'. I ask why Mr Beazley's department subsequently advised Mr Howe's department only two days before the March 1993 election:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . if the payment is to be made direct to either a private organisation or a local government authority, rather than through the WA Government&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators that by then it had changed colour&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">then it cannot be made from Division 886. </PARA>
<PARA>What a fundamental question! Obviously, Mr Dawkins&mdash;and I can assure honourable senators from these files that there is a letter there&mdash;sought to have the Western Australian government, rather than the federal government, fund this project.

Days before Mr Dawkins resigned from this parliament, he wanted another special fiddle, another special deal done.

When they started hiring mercenaries, they lost. What the Labor Right did in New South Wales was keep finding mercenaries and win. The way we did that was to convince those people who were on the Left but who had the kind of wisdom that only those who wanted to switch could ever have, to make the switch.

You may think that when one gets someone to swing across the factions there is a huge price involved, that there is some dastardly deal, that there is some great gun to the head. We actually talked outside a school of arts in Kogarah on a cold winter's night after a state electorate council meeting and he asked me to organise an interview with Bill Colbourne, a much underrated but incredibly important figure in Labor history, who would not talk to anybody but who did talk to Stephen after I rang him. So I picked up Stephen for a song. Keating is fond of saying of Brereton, `I picked him up on a surfboard and I can put him back there anytime I like'. I am, however, not about to say that of Stephen because, over the course of the 20 years since the school of arts, he has come a long way. I congratulate him on that.

I want to thank those people from the Centre Left faction, because the speech that I made at the conference after that is one that I have still got a video of.

That made the printed budget speech useless and it made a joke of a Labor government. Such things are impossible now, because we have actually learnt during the course of the last 11 years to talk to each other and to sort the problems out before they become either an embarrassment to the party or an embarrassment to ourselves.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say to Senator Richardson that I will miss him&mdash;and I will especially miss him and his company at question time. I suppose it has often been pondered up there in the press gallery, watching Graham and me talking at question time, whether are we plotting this or that. I have to reveal what we have been doing over the years, even though it may devalue people's opinions of us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Half the conversations have really revolved around Graham's view and my differing view of the batting abilities of Dean Jones and Steve Waugh. That war has been going on for several years. It got to its peak about a year ago when we were arguing about who had played the most test matches. I claimed that Steve Waugh had played more test matches than Dean Jones, and vice versa. After a 40-minute argument in between the odd question from the Democrats and others, I picked up the chamber phone, rang my office, who in turn rang the Australian Cricket Board, who in turn rang us back and said, `You are both wrong. They have both played 45 tests'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also miss the fact that we will not be here discussing the latest Tom Clancy novel or the latest film. I will miss the repartee. I will miss the ascerbic assertions and sardonic asides that often go on and make question time bearable. Thank you for moving and allowing Senator Cook to sit here for my next few years in the Senate, Senator Richardson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say for the record that I first met Graham Richardson in 1972. He was a newly appointed organiser for the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. One of his first missions for the New South Wales branch was to be sent south to see the Mexicans and attend a conference of the Labor Party, Victorian style. He was sent down to observe what the real hard men of the Left were all about&mdash;the George Crawfords, the Bill Hartleys, the Bill Browns and the rest of them. So Graham came down and sat at the back of our conference and watched the neo-Stalinists from the Labor Party in Victoria. I am sure when he went back home to New South Wales to report to brother Ducker and others he probably reported along the following lines: `Well, you are absolutely right to tell me how bad those mad lefties are. But let me tell you our right wing allies down there are to the left of the steering committee in New South Wales'. He was totally horrified. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also have to say that one of my next major contacts with Graham was in the 1981 state election. That was the year of the second Wranslide, if you like. On election night I think Graham actually drove me down to the election night tally room. I was not very well known up there. I remember standing amongst a group of people and, as the flood of votes came in and more and more seats fell to the Labor Party, increasing their already massive majority, a very noted left winger of the New South Wales branch looked at the board and said, `This is a perfect election result. We have won extra seats and Don Day'&mdash;who, incidentally, was a right winger, `has lost his seat'. Being a dutiful citizen of the Right, I reported this conversation to Graham Richardson who was then general secretary. But as the night went on, Don Day's figures improved and, in fact, Don Day eventually won. There was another candidate, a left wing candidate called Gorrick, in the seat of Hornsby, who had an early lead which disappeared as the night went on. As we got in the lift to leave that night and the lift doors were almost closed, this left winger was walking towards us. Graham Richardson said, `Perfect election result. We have increased our majority and Gorrick lost'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Graham's first caucus appearance was also very notable. At the time I was a scrutineer. Scrutineers, as a returning officer would say, used to hand out the ballot papers. Being the Senate scrutineer, I would hand them out only to senators and someone else would hand them out to the Reps people. I saw Graham Richardson about four down in the queue, and only House of Reps in front of him. So I very quickly filled in his ballot paper, folded it, and as he came to me I gave him his ballot paper. As he walked away he saw that he had already voted. Just as he got six feet away I said, `We do it a bit differently up here, Graham'. I am not sure whether he believed me or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only time I have been embarrassed by Graham Richardson was in about 1984-5. I had the great honour then of chairing Estimates Committee C. Who could forget the hours we spent on Estimates Committee C? Graham did not hold any formal position in the parliament. When I was in his office one day  I said, `Look, Graham, you really need some chairing experience. I offer you the chairmanship of committee C'. What really embarrassed me was that Graham was so grateful. He said, `Thank you for that sacrifice. I really do appreciate it'. Four days later, after 30 hours of the estimates committee hearing which Graham chaired, I got a ring at the Labor Club from one of his staff members to ask if I could come back and give him an hour's relief in the chair. I thank Graham for taking over Estimates Committee C&mdash;I am sure he learned a lot through it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been in a lot of debates together. I recalled one earlier this evening&mdash;quite clearly, people in this parliament know it. There was a very intensive debate on the uranium issue, and Graham and I were on different sides. As the debate got closer, we agreed at least to sit down and discuss what the final vote would be so at least we all knew. So we went through the list name by name, tick this way, tick that way; and we agreed on the complete way caucus would vote except for one remaining individual. We had one of these meaningless arguments: `Yes, he will vote my way', `No, he won't, he will vote my way'. We went backwards and forwards, backwards and forwards. Finally, Graham Richardson said, `Give me one reason, one reason, why Dean Wells will not vote for the pro-uranium thing'. I said, `He was born in Hiroshima in 1946. How's that?'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We remember these times together though we tend also to remember the tough times and there have been plenty of those; Graham has referred to some of them. It is true to say that the national conferences of 1982 and 1984 were about as hard a school as one could ever go through. For that 1982 conference, over the five days I think we got nine hours sleep total. 1984 was no easier. 1986 was not so tough but, as Graham said, massively entertaining. The worst aspect of it was that the business observers sat through five days of boring conference. We told them the rules debate would not be interesting. They went home and missed the one great fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also went through many experiences&mdash;as one does in the Labor Party&mdash;on the national executive where probably Graham Richardson's greatest speeches were delivered to a very small and privileged audience. Some of the most impassioned and the most forceful speeches that he ever delivered were at the national executive. I know it is getting late so I want to conclude on this note. Everyone in politics on both sides of this house attracts labels and Graham has attracted many of those: `numbers man', `king-maker', and tonight I noticed `thug' was put in by one of his friends from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I became assistant secretary of the state branch of the party in 1980 Graham was the branch general secretary.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But you did not work in the same office. I have always given, and I think Graham deserves, great credit for his role in preserving the natural environment in this country, but when he was general secretary of the New South Wales ALP his pre-eminent interest was in the preservation of the power of the New South Wales Right. At a time when new residents of the inner city of Sydney were seeking to join the ALP, seeking to make it relevant to urban dwellers not connected with the old party patronage systems, in my view Graham supported the very worst elements of those old municipal machines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Richardson's loyalty to some people in the ALP at that time was misplaced. I do understand and respect the fact that his loyalty was tribal, but his loyalty at times got him into some hot water. I think the left of the party was needed to play a role there, to clean out the ALP in that area and preselect a range of candidates who did have some social relevance to their local communities. As Senator Richardson has said, and I can concur, we did not often agree; in fact, for a period we never did. But while we did not agree, the honourable senator set the rules of factional warfare in New South Wales. He enforced those rules and he honoured those rules. I think we were able, to some extent, to limit areas of conflict in the party. I do not believe that Senator Richardson ever was involved in conflict for conflict's sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remember that in the 1970s and the early 1980s Senator Richardson supported a winner take all approach to Labor politics. I think he has modified and changed that view over the years. He certainly seems to have accepted the principle, and has led many others in the party to accept the principle, that those outside his grouping, his faction&mdash;the right wing&mdash;have a role to play in the party and a role to play in government. Given the diversity and nature of our party right across this nation, it is very important to give opportunities to those who have got a contribution to make, regardless of their factional allegiance. If we had not seen that sort of attitude change&mdash;to a significant degree driven by Senator Richardson&mdash;I am sure we would not have seen the long-term Labor government that we have seen here in Canberra and that we certainly saw in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Richardson and I have always been fierce factional opponents. Every year for the last 18 years, I think, we have locked horns at the New South Wales ALP annual conference. There were a few other players, and a few of them I notice are here in the Senate with me tonight. I will not mention any names, even that of Senator Loosley. But there have even been occasions, in the absence of any real disagreement between the factions, when we have had to contrive a set piece debate or two out of nothing at all. I think sometimes we were able to add a bit of humour, amidst a fair dose of vitriol, to these ritual engagements that occurred at the party conferences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I muse, as I know Senator Richardson has at times, that on some occasions we must have done it reasonably well: we fooled all the media all the time and most of the delegates all of the time, when we did not always mean what we said about each other. But we would agree that there were many occasions when we said some extraordinarily harsh things about each other and we really did mean them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I have been around this party for a long time, I have been around machine politics for a long time, and I must say that Senator Richardson is the most effective machine politician that I have ever seen. I consider that to be a pretty big rap from someone in the Australian Labor Party. When Senator Richardson came here, he did not take refuge in the obscurity of the Senate. The honourable senator immersed himself in the issues of the day, and he never shied away from taking on a hostile media. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every now and again this parliament is enriched by men and women who have colour and a passionate commitment to their political beliefs.

His last hurrah was in health, and I think he can be very proud of his efforts to lift Aboriginal health to the top of the political agenda. I believe that is one of his genuine interests and political aspirations too, and I look forward to the Aboriginal health package in the budget. If what he is intimating about its content is true, then this might well go down as his finest policy achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We look forward to Senator Richardson's book, which I expect will cover in some detail a whole host of things that many people will be looking to read, about winning and keeping government perhaps. My colleague Senator Bourne has lots of Richo anecdotes, most of which are not suitable for repetition in this chamber this evening, except for one. She told me how on the day before the last election she was walking down Phillip Street in Sydney with an armful of flowers engrossed in thought and he jumped out literally in front of her and warned her that if she did not look where she was going, she might run into people. He was looking and sounding incredibly cheerful and he proceeded to tell her that the ALP was going to win the next day's election by 13 seats. We really think that is the ultimate in number crunching. </PARA>

But, if he is fortunate enough to be able to make a change, then I think I share a philosophy with him, which is seize the day and do it. He has often mentioned that without the capacity for change one dies in this business, and I think that is an important lesson for all of us here on all sides of this chamber. On behalf of the Democrats, I wish Senator Richardson well, but I would not dare call him mate. </PARA>

It is evident in the answers he gives to questions asked by the Democrats, the Greens and me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have a period of questions without notice. Obviously, we all think very often it is a period of questions without answers.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, a number of people in this evening's debate have made reference to Graham's political qualities. I agree with the remarks passed by Senator Ray and with much of Senator Faulkner's contribution. I want to say a few things about that in a moment. But I begin by saying that I have known Graham more as a personal friend over the past 20 years. Not many people could say that for two decades they have known someone who has been as warm and as generous in that friendship. Graham has a Trumanesque quality about him in that he gives absolute loyalty to people. He asks it of people in return, but he always gives it. He is always concerned about people and their families&mdash;how the children are faring, how the family is at home. He understands the pressures. I know that Cheryl, who is in the gallery, understands the pressures as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I actually thought I knew Graham before I met him. I had known of him by reputation for quite a while. I found it extraordinary, when I walked into a local government campaign meeting out at Ramsgate in Sydney in the winter of 1974, that Graham knew me by name even before I had been introduced to him. He was a very sharp political figure even at that time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the ensuing years I have grown to know him as the most formidable person in Australian politics, and I have had the privilege to know a great many very able people: Prime Ministers Whitlam, Hawke and Keating and Premier Wran, among a number of other very gifted individuals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Graham had two great mentors in Labor politics&mdash;John Patrick Ducker and Neville Wran. He has been able to blend the capacities that those two people brought to politics to an extraordinary degree. He took John Ducker's intuition about the labour movement and Neville Wran's electoral judgment and mixed the two capacities. I remember we were at lunch with Gary Punch in 1977, in one of those Chinese restaurants down Dixon Street that Graham and John and a lot of other people would know so well.

Graham has been part of the changed political culture both within the Australian Labor Party and within the national political environment. I was saying to him earlier today that, if we look at what has happened between 1983 and 1994, the best measure of the changes over the years is that when Graham came into this Senate federal Labor governments were something of an aberration, perhaps even an oddity. We were elected at times of national emergency, be it depression or war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have now become the party of government during the decade of the 1980s going into the 1990s with five successive wins, and that was achieved only on the basis of an extraordinary change in Labor's political culture, emphasising that some things had to change in terms of our platform, in terms of our campaigning and in terms of our leadership. On questions of leadership, something that has never been written about the change that occurred in 1982-83 when Bob Hawke replaced Bill Hayden and in 1991 when Paul Keating replaced Bob Hawke is the toll that it took on Graham in terms of managing and directing those events. He has a very gruff exterior; he is always very confident. I saw behind the door from time to time just what a toll it was taking on him in a personal sense, but he persevered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">John Kerin said to me just prior to the 1993 election that what differentiated Graham Richardson from a great many other people in politics was that he was always prepared to do the hard things that no-one else was prepared to do. That did not make him popular and he did not always want to do it, but he understood that certain things had to be done, Mr President, as you appreciate. In football parlance, it was making the hard yards, and there is no harder political forum in the country&mdash;with the possible exception of the ALP national conference, though I am a little in doubt about that&mdash;than the New South Wales ALP annual conference, as Senator Faulkner would see from one perspective and Senator Richardson and I would see from another perspective. For the past two decades, Graham has always been one of the key speakers, always in the difficult debates.

I think Senator Kernot's remarks with respect to his perhaps new-found interest in Aboriginal health reinforce that. But I want to tell Senator Richardson that he should not be too upset about what Walshy said because it is my personal view that we have all got our skills, some more than others in different ways, but they are all different and we have all got our roles to play. His people have made it abundantly clear tonight the role he has played in holding them together. That is obviously a very valuable thing. If he has not had a policy issue in his head in 11 years, which was the implication of what former Senator Walsh was saying, I would not let it worry him.

There has not been too much about what happened here and about policy issues.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a lunchtime meeting in some tacky old room in the old Parliament House. Senator Richardson walked in and looked around and thought, `I have not got the numbers here'. I was very new then and I thought, `This is not too bad, we have the numbers here'. Senator Richardson sat down and said, `Look, you can do what you&mdash;expletive deleted&mdash;well like because, if you take advantage of having the numbers now, we will just undo it as soon as we can, as soon as the Standing Orders allow us to. You may as well just accept that we are going to have our way.

The first is that I listened to him at the beginning of his speech as if he were almost soliloquising, but I am sure that he really had a burden on his heart when he talked about what he understood to be the movement in this chamber in more recent times to dwell upon debates of personality rather than policies and politics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suspect there was something heavy on his soul which moved him to say that; it was not simply a matter of altruism&mdash;a generous lecture to all of us before he left. Whatever the motive, what he says has a great deal of virtue. It is something that we all ought to be conscious of because we run the risk in this chamber of inexorably finding ourselves with a nature not dissimilar to that of the House of Representatives, in terms of playing the man and not the game and thinking that is what gets the points and the goals on the board.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether I might indulge myself for one moment to remind Senator Richardson of an experience of which in small part he will have some living memory. I have in my drawers 176 pages of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of vile and untruthful accusations, allegations and attacks upon me, my family and companies I have been associated with. They were all delivered by former Senator Peter Walsh from the government's side.

On one other occasion I well remember my wife sitting in the President's gallery and being subjected to personal attack by Senator Walsh.

Of course, it is less a weapon when one is in government than in opposition, although Senator Walsh never understood the difference when it came to me. I could never understand those on our side who actually liked him and had a couple of beers with him when he was getting up next morning with his hangover and giving me another one.

Let me say that in my view Senator Richardson has excelled in both. Clearly, his party has received the enormous benefit of his skills and his ability and so has his government. It is a question of judgment for all of us as to whether or not the community has benefited from that, but the honourable senator is certainly one who has had enormous influence in both aspects.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I always felt that when the honourable senator was minister for the environment he was a person to whom one could speak in those terms. He understood the language of sustainability. He had the intellect to comprehend the ramifications of what sustainability meant and, moreover, he was somebody with whom one could be reasonably assured that one would get a hearing and an outcome from lobbying in fairly short order. He would either say, `Yes, I will do that' or `No, I will not do that', and within half an hour an agreement would be made in relation to what needed to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would also like to add that in this place we do not just need people with intellect; they also need to have wisdom and a commitment to social change. That supersedes loyalty simply to the party. If there is one criticism that I would make of the old parties&mdash;and it was one reason why I joined the Australian Democrats&mdash;it is that very often loyalty to party is rated much more highly than loyalty to principle. That is a great pity, because at this time we need a thorough commitment to environmental change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of achievements on the environment, it is commonly accepted by those who understand these things that Senator Richardson, in his time as minister for the environment, achieved a great deal in terms of Tasmania, the wet tropics and in the protection of areas as world heritage areas, and in many other respects in moving the agenda forward on the question of sustainability. As time goes by, Australia will be very grateful that that was done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot reflected on the motivation involved in that, and the media has also reflected on that motivation, but I would simply say that, had Senator Richardson not fully understood what he was doing, he would not have been able to pull it off with the Greens. I would certainly say that he did understand what he was doing and that he had a real commitment to it. It was fortunate that it was also of advantage to the Australian Labor Party at several elections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish Senator Richardson the very best in his retirement. There are very few people in this place with the sorts of qualities that he has shown&mdash;commitment and surety of decision making. This place will be the poorer for his passing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not intending to speak until Senator Richardson gave me a mention and recollected a number of events. However, I will now say that Senator Richardson's contribution as a minister has been an excellent one, both for this government and for the people of Australia. In my view, it ranks as more than equal to his considerable achievements as a member of the national executive, the national conference and as a state secretary to the New South Wales branch.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the long run it will be Senator Richardson's ministerial achievements that will be remembered, and quite rightly so. Although, on an anecdotal basis, as people interested in Australian Labor Party folklore and history, we will remember the stories, it is the ministerial achievements of Senator Richardson, which he and others have explained, which will be an outstanding record of which he can be proud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that in the past I may have sinned vis-a-vis Senator Richardson on some issues of a factional nature. But overwhelmingly it has to be recognised by a number of us who were on the national executive in those, I will not say heady days of the early and mid-1980s, sometimes scary days, when the Labor Party was coming to terms with the fact that we could be forming a long-term government at the national level as well as having many state Labor governments, that Senator Richardson played a major role in ensuring that we got used to the idea, not only that we should win occasionally, but that we should win often. As he said today at his press conference, there are millions of people out there who live better lives by having a Labor government, particularly a national Labor government, in office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not care to count or remember all the critical votes at those conferences or national executives, particularly on so-called interventions into various state branches to try to resolve problems, but what they were about was the Labor Party becoming a truly national organisation with a national aspect. He did mention, with Senator Harradine, the famous case of expelling Bill Hartley for which I moved the motion. It is an action I have never regretted, because I believe it showed a maturity in the Labor Party, that we were serious about how we should govern ourselves, so we could show the people we could govern them adequately and properly. I do not think anybody in the party since that day of expulsion&mdash;even those who voted against it then&mdash;have ever regretted that that expulsion took place, because Mr Hartley was just out of step with the traditions, the rules and the policies of the Labor Party. They were tough decisions which were properly taken at the time. I agree with Senator Ray that the best speeches I heard Senator Richardson make were as a member of the national executive in&mdash;unfortunately, in a sense&mdash;a closed meeting when he spoke with great passion on those issues and made a great contribution that had a great effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Richo, I will miss you. I will miss your style and panache. I will miss your abuse occasionally. I will miss your jokes and one-liners which sometimes can be so politically devastating to those of us on the receiving end. Fortunately, most of the time the other side was on the receiving end of them, and that has been a great contribution to the public presentation of the Labor Party and the Labor government. So I look forward to seeing you around from time to time, and when I am stuck in an estimates committee I will be thinking, `That rotten bloody Richardson is playing golf while I am stuck in this estimates committee for several hours'. I think you are lucky in getting out of all of that. Richo, to you and your wife, Cheryl, and your family, all the best for the future. I have enjoyed the very many years, now close to 20, where I have had an association with you through the Labor Party. They have been the best 20 years for the Labor Party and I have been greatly glad to have been associated with you in those great 20 years. </PARA>

<TITLE>Campbell Town: Water Supply</TITLE>
<SPEECH PAGE="2358" SPEAKER="Bell Sen R.J." NAMEID="7U4" PARTY="AD" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (1.49 a.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have already indicated to Senator Richardson, I intend to speak about the water supply at Campbell Town&mdash;so you are all excused! I wish Senator Richardson well and I have already indicated that. Today, I received some important correspondence from some of the citizens of Campbell Town, one of Tasmania's oldest towns some 60 kilometres south of Launceston. Campbell Town is located in the heart of prime pastoral land producing some of the world's finest wools, and I say that without qualification.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Campbell Town's domestic water flows from the Snowy River into Lake Leake where it is stored. From Lake Leake it travels in a canal, which is actually a clay ditch, for approximately eight kilometres into the Elizabeth River. That flows through pastoral and cropping land. There are some irrigators who have access to the Elizabeth River at this point. The town draws its water directly from the Elizabeth River.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The correspondence I received&mdash;and I am sure you are interested, Mr President&mdash;was in the form of a petition. It was asking the federal government to initiate research into the causes of the poor quality of the township's water supply. It noted that claimed causes of the deteriorating quality included increasing sewerage discharges, increasing use of agricultural chemicals and increasing erosion due to the agricultural and forestry operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About 140 citizens signed that petition in the few days that it was circulated. They are keen to see some action taken because there is no doubt that the water quality is worse than it has ever been. The local council has been of little assistance to the concerns of the residents. The local council, the Northern Midlands Council, sent some correspondence to one of the residents. The building and health surveyor writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately we have no water treatment plant for the Campbell Town Water Supply Scheme, nor for any other scheme in the municipality. Consequently the quality of the water is seasonally affected by heavy rainfalls in the catchment areas, particularly where there are large areas of land under cultivation or where there is logging activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be of little consolation to know that the Northern Midlands is not the only municipality that has untreated water supplies. Nevertheless, it is significant to realise that almost all country towns suffer the same plight, simply because in the past they have lacked the population and therefore the resources to provide costly water filtration plants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of amalgamation we will be able to address this problem more effectively in the future, but it will take time and it will be costly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although there is no legal requirement on Councils to provide fully treated water that meets the standard of the National Health and Medical Research Council, it is certainly our intention to aim for this standard and upgrade our supplies as finances are made available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The only treatment that our main water supply schemes receive is chlorination and fluoridation and as a result of this, we can at least say that the water is safe to drink, even if it is not aesthetically appealing at all times.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yours faithfully</PARA>
<PARA>That was signed by the building and health surveyor. A building and health surveyor was also quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tasmanian Country</EMPHASIS> of Friday, 29 October 1993. In a recent report to his council he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The quality of our drinking water has been a concern for many years and would undoubtedly be the greatest source of complaints that we receive in respect of services rendered.</PARA>
<PARA>In that same newspaper article, a Campbell Town resident Mr John Watson was quoted. This was not Senator Watson, I would hasten to add, but a resident of the town. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Campbell Town very much depends economically on the visitors it attracts. I've worked as Education Officer at The Grange for many years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"We have approximately 2000 guests using The Grange&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is an adult education or a community education residential centre&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">in an average year, and many complain about the water. We now regularly collect rain water from a tank and deliver it to The Grange.</PARA>
<PARA>Another document I have here quotes the council's environmental health officer. In a report to the council he writes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During recent inspections under the Public Health Food Hygiene Regulations quite some criticism was directed at me for checking out the hygiene of food preparations, when a basic ingredient supplied by council was unfit for human consumption. Although chlorination may have rendered the water free from all harmful bacteria, it was nevertheless undrinkable because of its physical properties.</PARA>
<PARA>Whilst this matter may not be unique to Campbell Town, the residents are rightly concerned. In their petition to the Senate, the residents are not asking for a grant, although I venture to suggest that some of the pork-barrelling largess which was distributed before the last election might have been better spent addressing problems such as these. Nevertheless, the residents are not asking for something for nothing. I think that a good start to satisfying their demands would be the application of minimum national standards for domestic water. Assistance to meet those standards could, in the first instance, be via long-term loans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Northern Midlands Council is saving up for its water treatment plant. The council has about $300,000 in the bank but it does not want to call tenders until it has closer to $1 million. Even then, that will only be the start of the program of building treatment plants. So the resolution of the problem seems to be well into the future. It seems to me that the federal government could, and should, accept the responsibility for ensuring that all Australians can rely on having access to a good standard of domestic water. This is a matter that should continue to be taken up, not only for the residents of Campbell Town but for the residents of many other small country towns around Australia who have not been able to guide themselves to resolving the water problems that they have in common, which seem to me to be of greater priority than many of the other things we concern ourselves with in this place. </PARA>
