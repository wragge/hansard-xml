<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill, through its proposed changes to sections 35 and 36 of the Migration Act 1958 (which were renumbered in December 1989 to become sections 87 and 88 respectively)  seeks to restore to those sections the effect they were previously thought to possess.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 36 (now section 88) of the Act deals with people who come to Australia by boat without prior authorisation and who may be kept in custody until the departure of the vessel from its last port of call in Australia. Up until May 1991, unauthorised boat arrivals of the kind usually referred to as "boat people", were detained in custody under this section.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">High Court challenges to other aspects of migration legislation involving boat people subsequently cast doubt on the lawfulness of detention for a number of boat people under section 88 once it became apparent that the boats on which they had arrived would never depart Australia. This doubt turns not on the central issue of unauthorised arrival, but on the understanding that the vessel be expected to leave Australia on a further, outward and ongoing voyage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this instance, the Commonwealth acted on a mistaken view of what the law was, believing&mdash;like all other concerned parties&mdash;that its detention of boat people was lawful. It is significant that no-one, apparently including the boat people themselves&mdash;and their legal representatives&mdash;saw any reason to question the lawfulness of detention, as none of the vessels on which they had arrived had ever left Australia. Should that custody prove to have been unlawful, it is as a result of an innocent and technical breach, and no more. This has created an artificial situation when the fact of the matter is that the boat people did arrive in Australia unlawfully, and their detention was based on the understanding of  the provisions of section 36 (section 88) by the Government and the Department at that time. Nevertheless, actions for damages have been lodged by some 88 of the boat people who now maintain that their detention under section 36 (section 88) was unlawful.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">New provisions to detain unauthorised boat arrivals came into effect in May 1992 with the commencement of Division 4B of the Act. These provisions, under which the boat people have been detained since May 1992, were found by the High Court in December 1992 to be constitutionally valid. However, at that time the High Court cast doubt upon the use of section 88 to detain boat people. As a consequence, section 54RA was enacted in late December 1992. This section extinguished the right of action for damages for false imprisonment for persons found to have been unlawfully detained under section 88 prior to their transfer to custody under Division 4B of the Act, replacing it with a statutory right of action limiting to one dollar per day the damages payable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As my predecessor declared to Parliament, ". . . It is essential to counter the possibility of significant damages claims. It would be absurd for the Australian taxpayer to be expected to underwrite compensation payments to people who arrived here without authority and who have been detained on reasonable grounds while their claims to remain were exhaustively examined".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A case challenging the constitutional validity of the compensation scheme established in section 54RA&mdash;and I would repeat that the compensation scheme in section 54RA was regarded as constitutionally valid at that time&mdash;can be expected to be heard by the High Court later this year. This is a test case related to the action for unlawful detention to which I referred earlier. The main ground for challenge is likely to be that section 54RA breaches section 51(xxxi) of the Constitution, in that it involves an acquisition of property by the Commonwealth otherwise than on just terms. A number of High Court decisions since section 54RA was enacted on the ambit of the "just terms" requirement in the acquisitions power in the Constitution have raised doubts whether the limit on damages to one dollar per day is constitutional.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I earlier remarked, the amendments proposed seek to reflect the Commonwealth's previous understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88), and their operation. Legislative amendment of this kind can be classed as "curative", which retrospectively corrects defects discovered in the law or its administration, and restores what was previously thought by all parties to be the status quo.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent High Court judgements involving the "just terms" requirement of our Constitution have suggested that this approach of "curative" legislation is an avenue available to the Commonwealth. Indeed the courts, including the present Chief Justice of the High Court, have emphasised that it is always open for Parliament to correct developments in the law, other than in constitutional matters, where those developments do not accord with Parliament's intention. The rationale for curative legislation is the strong public interest in the proper functioning of government. Occasional defects in administration or statutory drafting are inevitable, and it may be fairly argued that a law which seeks retrospectively to cure innocent defects does not take away rights, but merely gives effect to administrative action already taken; action, it should be noted, which was previously assumed by all relevant parties to be valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is therefore proposed to amend sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) of the Act from 1 November 1989 to give them the effect which they were previously thought to have. These amendments do not seek to change the operation of those sections, but insert new provisions intended instead to reflect the Commonwealth's understanding of sections 35 (section 87) and 36 (section 88) and the manner in which they were actually administered in practice prior to the commencement of Division 4B. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted at every stage of the drafting process. It is the view of that Department that the amendments are not inconsistent with Australia's  obligations under international law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1AA)) seeks to put beyond doubt that section 36 (section 88) authorises the custody, for a finite period, of persons who arrive without lawful authority on board a vessel that subsequently is unable to depart Australia because it has been destroyed, or for example is not seaworthy, has been impounded or forfeited, has sunk, or is otherwise unable to depart.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amendment also permits the taking and keeping of persons in custody, notwithstanding that the vessel on which those persons departed for Australia might not necessarily be the same vessel on which those persons arrive. It is restricted to persons who arrive on vessels that have left an Australian port and returned to an Australian port without having entered any other country. This covers situations where a person arrives at a port in Australia on an Australian based vessel to which the person was transferred from the vessel on which that person left another country, for instance to a rescue vessel when the original vessel is about to sink.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In these circumstances envisaged by new subsection 36(1AA) (subsection 88(1AA)) it is not appropriate that the period for which a person may be detained should be determined by reference to the departure of a vessel from a port. The proposed amendments will, therefore, provide that custody is to be authorised until the person is granted an entry permit; or for such period as is necessary to allow for the person's removal from Australia, following a request in writing from the person to be removed, or after all applications to remain (for example, entry permit applications and applications for refugee status) and associated appeals or reviews have been finalised, or once all consideration of whether the person will be permitted to remain in Australia has been otherwise concluded; or until such earlier time as an authorised officer directs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Migration Act, a person is considered to have entered Australia once they disembark in Australia. Proposed subsection 36(1AB) (section 88(1AB)) makes it clear that a person is taken not to have entered Australia as a result of temporarily, haphazardly disembarking&mdash;for instance, on an island off the Australian mainland, briefly and without the knowledge of the Australian authorities&mdash;after which the persons then reboard their vessel.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendment to section 35 (section 87) similarly does not seek to alter its existing operation but instead inserts specific provisions, to avoid any doubts, as to the extent of the power under this section.

<PARA>On 25 November 1993, the following matter was referred to the Committee of Privileges on the motion of the Chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, Senator McKiernan:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having regard to the article in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 25 November 1993, headed `Mps to press for softer detention rules for refugees', whether there was a disclosure of a document that is confidential to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, or of proceedings in private session of that Committee, without the authorisation of the Committee, and, if so, whether a contempt was committed by that disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee of Privileges has received declarations from all members of the migration committee and on behalf of the staff that they did not improperly disclose a document or proceedings of the committee to any person, including the author of the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS>, Ms Margo Kingston. The committee also sought a submission from Ms Kingston, who advised that she was unable to assist for ethical reasons. Furthermore, it sought information from another journalist in the light of the matter raised by the chairman of the migration committee.

It has particular concerns about the conflict between the requirement of a house of parliament to protect the integrity of its proceedings, especially in relation to protection of witnesses, and, on the other hand, journalists' commitment to protecting their sources. The committee has therefore recommended that this case be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for consideration as part of that committee's inquiry into the rights and responsibilities of the media.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to appropriate the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the running costs and capital expenditures of the parliamentary departments for the year ending 30 June 1995. The total amount sought is $127.6 million.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1994-95 totalling $29,810.7 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriation Bill (No. 1) provides for proposed expenditure on the ordinary annual services of Government. The expenditure program of the Government, to which the provisions in this bill relate, was outlined in the Treasuer's Budget Speech, on 10 May.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amount of $215 million is included under the Advance to Minister for Finance, an increase of 25 per cent over the amount which was provided in Appropriation Act (No. 1) last year. This increase is the first since 1987-88 and is slightly less than the CPI growth over the intervening period. The increase is similar in magnitude to the increase in the Advance to the Minister for Finance provided for in Appropriation Bill (No.2) 1994-95 which I will introduce shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 4 of the bill provides for the appropriation of the Consolidated Revenue Fund to enable the Minister for Finance to issue an amount for the payment of increases in salary and payments in the nature of salary arising out of awards, orders or determinations made under, or in accordance with a law.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1994-95 totalling $5,013.8 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Appropriation Bill (No. 2) provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital in nature, and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been previously approved. Provision is also made for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An amount of $175 million is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, an increase of 25 per cent over the amount which was provided in Appropriation Act (No. 2) last year. This increase is the first since 1987-88 and is slightly less than the CPI growth over the intervening period. The increase is similar in magnitude to the increase in the Advance to the Minister for Finance provided for in Appropriation Bill (No.1) 1994-95 which was introduced earlier this evening.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Details of the proposed expenditure are set out in Schedule 2 to the bill, the main features of which were outlined in the Treasurer's Budget Speech. I commend the bill to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">LOAN BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. Successive Governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditures that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Budget deficit of $11.7 billion for 1994-95 gives rise to a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of about $18.9 billion. The difference between the two deficits arises because appropriations from that Fund include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund to redeem or repurchase Commonwealth securities and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred in 1994-95 after the passage of the bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund and, if necessary, to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the Loan Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $14.7 million for 1994-95, the bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already approved by, or currently before, the Parliament. I emphasise that the bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the bill to the Senate and present the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">SALES TAX (LOW-ALCOHOL WINE) AMENDMENT BILL 1994</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I propose to return the sales tax rate on low-alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages that have an alcohol content of 1.15 per cent or less by volume from 12 per cent, to the concessional rate, which is currently 11 per cent. This measure will place low-alcohol wine, cider and similar beverages on the same footing as their main competitor, non-alcoholic beverages consisting wholly of Australian fruit juice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)noting the legal advice provided to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee that there may be a conflict between the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 on the one hand and the Native Title Act 1993 and Australia's international obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity on the other; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b)refers the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report on this potential conflict.</PARA>
<PARA>This motion, standing in my name, relates to the need to refer the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. The motion arises from evidence which was given before a Senate committee inquiry into this bill, which raised the possibility that the legislation which the Senate is about to consider could well be in conflict with either or both the Native Title Bill or the International Convention on Biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of that possibility&mdash;this is the reason I bring this matter before the Senate&mdash;I, and the Australian Democrats, believe that this bill should be referred to the legal and constitutional affairs committee for resolution of that potential conflict rather than pass legislation which may indeed be in conflict with legislation recently passed and, therefore, leaving one hell of a mess for law courts to sort out. That is not to gainsay in any way the possibility that it might seriously damage the rights which native people might have under the Native Title Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cause of the conflict arises from the fact that the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill flows from, in part, the twin events that occurred after the negotiation of the international convention for the protection of new varieties of plants, which concluded in March 1991. These events were the decision in relation to the Native Title Bill, the Mabo decision, and also the acquiescence to the international agreement on biodiversity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under section 10 of the Native Title Act, native title is recognised and protected. But the problem arises because native title, while it is not able to be extinguished contrary to the Native Title Act, nonetheless does not fully define the extent of native title, and that is where the conflict may well arise. The definition of native title can be found in section 208(1). The subsection states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The expression "native title" or "native title rights and interests" means the communal, group or individual rights and interests of Aboriginal people or Torres Strait Islanders in relation to land or waters, where:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a) the rights and interests are possessed under the traditional laws acknowledged, and the traditional customs observed, by the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) the Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders by those laws and customs, have a connection with the land or waters; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c) the rights and interests are recognised by the common law of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>It protects also hunting and gathering. Subsection (3) of this section, which deals with rights and interests, states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If native title rights and interests as defined by subsection (1) are&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>or have been at any time in the past&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">compulsorily converted into, or replaced by, statutory rights and interests in relation to the same land or waters that are held by or on behalf of Aboriginal peoples or Torres Strait Islanders, those statutory rights and interests are also covered by the expression "native title" or "native title rights and interests".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not clear from that definition whether the native title rights which are granted to indigenous people, both Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, extend to the protection of plant species. It has been argued that the conflict arises because over many tens of thousands of years the Aboriginal people have managed the natural environment. They have used fire and a number of other techniques so that the extant species of plants are, in a sense, the result of their plant breeding. If that argument is accepted then those native peoples have some rights over those species, and the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill seeks to extinguish that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said earlier, the Native Title Bill says quite explicitly that native title can be extinguished only under the native title legislation. It cannot be extinguished by some other legislation. For instance, section 3 of the Plant Variety Rights Act of 1987 contains the following definition:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"new plant variety" means a plant variety that&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(a)   was originated by a person;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(c)   is stable; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(d)  is distinguishable by one or more important morphological, physiological or other characteristics from all other plant varieties whose existence was a matter of public knowledge at the time when the application in respect of the variety was made;</PARA>
<PARA>There is no reference as to time in terms of when the modifications must have been made, only that they must be distinguishable. It is at least arguable that many of these extant species of plants which are distinguishable are the result of that long period of Aboriginal occupation during which the Aboriginal people actually managed the environment, and culturally and collectively are responsible for those species, and therefore, under the Native Title Bill would have some claim to ownership of those species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has only recently become a matter of public knowledge that Aboriginal people performed these complex traditional management techniques&mdash;in particular, as I mentioned, fire management and resource management. This, it was argued before the previous Senate committee, can lead to a strong argument that these management techniques led to a maintenance of particular biota over others in a way which could be called plant breeding. Furthermore, it could be argued that the maintenance of biodiversity within areas in accordance with those traditional customs and practices gives rise to native title rights and interests. These interests, therefore, can be extinguished only in accordance with the Native Title Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a similar way, potential conflicts are arising between the passage of this bill and the international convention on biodiversity. The point about seeking the reference of this matter to the legal and constitutional affairs committee is to ensure as far as is possible that any conflicts are sorted out and resolved before this legislation passes into law. I am not going to suggest that that resolution should lead in any way to a diminution in native title and any rights which Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people should have and do have over species of plants. I believe that, if there is to be a resolution of any conflict between these two pieces of legislation, the resolution should fully respect and accept the rights which indigenous people have in relation to native species. Anticipating that there will be a conflict, I suggest to those who might seek to resolve the conflict that that is the way the conflict should be resolved&mdash;in favour of native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter was considered by the Standing Committee on the Scrutiny of Bills. The scrutiny of bills committee, in its consideration, found that the argument which had been put forward has the potential to extinguish or affect native title rights contrary to the Native Title Act. The Attorney-General's Department's advice, however, suggests the following:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is doubtful&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>not certain; doubtful&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that native title rights protected by the NTA would extend to the ownership of the genetic material in plants.</PARA>
<PARA>It concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress `it seems'; it is again not certain&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the bill will not affect native title rights contrary to the Native Title Act.</PARA>
<PARA>The scrutiny of bills committee went on to seek its own legal advice which, among other things, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legal adviser has pursued the submission which raised this matter and considers that he puts forward an arguable case.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, there is some substance at least to this argument which I have now put before the Senate. The legal adviser goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee may therefore be prepared to suggest the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill 1994 trespasses unduly on the rights recognised and protected by the Native Title Act 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, here is a situation in which we have&mdash;not surprisingly; it happens quite often&mdash;conflict between several sources of legal advice. But at least the scrutiny of bills committee and its legal adviser suggest that there is indeed substance in this argument and that, therefore, the bill which the Senate is about to consider may well trespass unduly on rights which are already established under law, although they are not well defined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that I urge the Senate most strongly that it accept this motion that that matter should be sorted out before the bill on plant breeders' rights is further considered by this Senate. I think that is the only proper course. It would be quite irresponsible of the Senate to pass legislation when it perceives that there are potential conflicts between an act and a bill which will shortly be passed and become an act. In those circumstances, it is the responsibility of the Senate as far as is possible to sort out those potential difficulties before they arise. I therefore commend this motion to the Senate. </PARA>

The advice concludes that it seems that the Bill will not affect native title rights contrary to the Native Title Act 1993. The advice also indicates that the Bill does not conflict with the international Conventions identified in Mr Baird's submission to the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>A letter from the Attorney-General, signed by Anna Funder, counsel on behalf of the Attorney-General's Department, regarding the Native Title Act 1993 said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The submission argues that the Bill has the potential to extinguish or affect native title rights contrary to the NTA (see S11). On a preliminary analysis, we do not agree with that argument for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NTA provides that, generally, future acts (which by definition affect native title) must be `permissible' to be validly done.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First, it seems unlikely that rights to genetic plant material would arise from customary indigenous laws.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, the NTA only protects the native title rights defined&mdash;that is native title rights in relation to land or waters. They include hunting, fishing and gathering, and native title rights would include usage of the resources of the land or waters. The resources would include plants, and the gathering of plants could be a native title right. Native title rights protected by the NTA might also extend to ownership of such plants. However&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Attorney-General goes on&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is doubtful whether they would include rights to the plant's genetic material.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what we are talking about here&mdash;the plants' genetic material:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The NTA does not deal with other aspects of customary indigenous laws. If there are indeed any rights to genetic plant material arising from such laws, they are very unlikely to be native title rights protected by the NTA.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thirdly, assuming indigenous rights to genetic plant material exist and are covered by the NTA, the development of registration of a new plant variety&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>a new plant variety, please note&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">from genetic material owned by native title holders, would not be an act affecting native title and would therefore not be regulated by the NTA. This is because any native title rights would be to the original plant material and, even though native title rights are not frozen in time, they are very unlikely to extend to the new plant variety.</PARA>
<PARA>On behalf of the Attorney-General, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The result is that it seems the Bill will not affect native title rights contrary to the NTA.</PARA>

The committee gave everyone a fair opportunity to have a go and come before us, and the report of the committee indicates that. It would now be merely a waste of time for this chamber to refer the bill to yet another committee for a further round of public hearings and then report again.

It may not be an argument that has been dealt with satisfactorily in previous debates in this place, and it may not have been satisfactorily dealt with even in the Native Title Act itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government has a well documented policy trail in two sources of written advice. The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill is not a major departure from the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987 and has only minor policy implications.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Plant Breeder's Rights Bill is not a major departure from the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>The Office of Parliamentary Counsel subsequently submitted the version of the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill produced on 24 March to the legislation committee of cabinet, repeating the contention that the bill, although rewritten in plain English, fell within the authority guidelines within which the bill was drafted and that the policy implications were minor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second source was the conclusion of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs to which this bill was referred. That committee concluded that the Plant Breeder's Rights Bill was not a major departure from the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. The committee went on to conclude that the passage of the bill should not be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given those circumstances, there is no justification for further delaying the passage of a bill that is not substantially different from the PVR act. That act was the subject of a 15-year public policy debate, including a Senate standing committee inquiry. This long debate, conducted in the 1970s and the 1980s, resulted in Australia being one of the last countries in the industrialised world to enact breeders' rights law. Public policy, and legal and constitutional matters have been given significant hearing and have been subject to scrutiny by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney-General's Department. We have also been advised that the PBR bill can have no impact on native title and the biodiversity convention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would say that further delays by referrals will jeopardise the chances of Australia acceding to the 1991 UPOV convention before 1996 because the conformity of its laws can only be tested once a year in October by the council of UPOV.

One can argue in that case that there are substantial arguments on both sides and, clearly, there is a possibility that that legislation could be thrown out by the High Court.

In answer to all the speakers who oppose this motion, I simply point out that, if they are concerned about the rapid application of this legislation, if indeed there is a conflict here and this matter becomes litigated in the High Court, that will certainly tie for a very long time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the agricultural and veterinary chemical bills have the support of the Senate. I take this opportunity to express my concern at the effects of our past and continuing use of chemicals, and to emphasise the need for ongoing development of alternatives to chemical usage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, I must say that things have improved. There is a greater recognition of the problems associated with chemical use in rural areas and the damaging impact on health, the environment and the long-term viability of those rural areas. Through the NRA, measures are being instituted that will begin to address these issues. A very important measure is a review of chemicals currently available in Australia, some of which are subject to limitations elsewhere. It is to be noted that this review, which is a very valuable introduction to the debate, is not even a discussion paper at this stage; it is hoped that it will be available within the next couple of months. However, there are still concerns in regard to the assessment of chemicals, registration, public access to data and commercial-in-confidence provisions. I will discuss these later.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard from Senator Ian Macdonald in a notice of motion on Monday last week that a disproportionately high percentage of people in regional, rural or remote areas will contract cancer; and they are at a greater risk of doing so because of their work practices and lifestyles. He went on to say that funding was needed for facilities and services comparable with those in the city. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, as well as treating cancer sufferers, we also need to address the environmental health conditions that have given rise to this high incidence in the first place; in particular the unsafe use of chemicals that impact on human health, and the need to identify and rehabilitate contaminated sites around the country. We need to be mindful of the precautionary principle when assessing chemicals. This principle advocates that when there is reason to believe that there may be adverse effects it is important to err on the side of caution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although there has been considerable good work done in terms of control of chemical use, there is still much to be done and we need to be mindful of the importance and immediacy of the situation. In regard to the work of the NRA, there is a need for a review and examination of the validity of the administration of the commercial-in-confidence provisions, a widening of the definition of who can be considered a third party in regard to applications for variations of approvals for registration, a longer assessment time, and more information being made available for people wanting to have input into the registration of chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Currently, there is no access to commercial-in-confidence data and there is a need to follow up promises to the Senate inquiry regarding this and also the public participation program, which still has not been developed. Chemicals that have been banned, withdrawn or restricted elsewhere in the world and are still being used in Australia leave us with serious questions. I will not go into them here, but there is a very great need for investigation of the different standards applied throughout the world in relation to chemicals and the different evaluations that have been made of their effects and their hazards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Environmental monitoring of waterways and wildlife for contamination and the impact on wildlife is vitally necessary. We need to see whether the contamination of waterways and the damage to wildlife is related to the use of pesticides and organophosphates in areas where the damage is occurring. Hopefully, the World Environment Day present from the minister for the environment, Senator Faulkner, regarding the monitoring and cleaning up of waterways around Australia will make a contribution in this area. It is also vitally important that there should be requirements for pre-notification of pesticide use to prevent accidental exposure of, for example, children in playing fields and schools. There has been a recent report of children being oversprayed with the fungicide Tilt while waiting for a school bus. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are dangers in dealing with these sprays and we need to be more aware of them. I have heard the argument that chemicals are essential for sustainable agriculture; that unless chemicals are used to ensure a high yield then the price we pay will be greater areas under cultivation. However, sustainable agriculture cannot just be defined in terms of soil loss and soil fertility. We need to define what we mean by `sustainable'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although I am aware of the difficulties farmers are facing in terms of environmental viability, declining prices and increased costs, I am also concerned with the immediate and long-term environmental and health problems that result from poor use of chemicals. For example, in cotton growing areas throughout New South Wales and Queensland, and also in the north-west of Western Australia in relation to the previous experiments with cotton growing in the Ord River scheme, there have been repeated accounts among Aboriginal people of skin diseases, lung and chest problems and birth deformities, which they feel are related to the unsafe pesticide and fertiliser use with which they were associated in previous work experiences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It illustrates the need for a community right to know of legislation and processes for monitoring the long-term impact on health and environment of commonly used pesticides. As well as costs in terms of human, environmental and animal health, there are also considerable economic costs in the rehabilitation of contaminated sites and, not so much loss of exports, but danger to us because of contaminated meat. I understand that the controls on export of contaminated meat are very strong. Many farmers would argue that their use of chemicals is not economically sustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Farmers have found that the mistakes of their forerunners in clearing land has led to the need for intensive tree planting, contouring and other changed practices to try to stop the loss of arable land through soil degradation, increasing salinity and other problems. We do not want to continue environmental and health problems for coming generations of farmers and others in the community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating jointly&mdash;or, to use the technical phrase, cognately&mdash;six separate bills, all to do with agricultural and veterinary chemical products. They are: a bill on the collection of the interim levy; a bill for the collection of the levy; a bill on administration; a bill on chemical products levy imposition, excise; a bill on chemical products levy imposition, customs; and a bill on chemical products interim levy imposition, general.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JI4">Senator Panizza</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Supporting it.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Panizza. I was in the act of ascertaining what the formal position of the minor parties would be, when my turn came to address this chamber. I am not certain of that position but doubtless at the conclusion of my remarks they will indicate by either calling for a vote or not. What is clear, however, is that with the support of the coalition, this legislation will carry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the debate some honourable senators expressed&mdash;quite reasonably, I would say&mdash;concerns about matters in the bill. While I recognise they are supporting it from the coalition side, nonetheless honourable senators have used the occasion of this debate to raise issues of concern and canvassed those in the chamber. I think it is appropriate that the government reply to some of those concerns in order to try to meet them, or, if not meet them, hopefully ameliorate the degree of concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, the concerns can be categorised as the delay in implementing the scheme and the charges that two states and the Australian Capital Territory will impose. I say that I, too, am concerned about the delay and I will maintain pressure on my state and territory colleagues to ensure the earliest possible commencement date for the scheme. To that end, I understand the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, my colleague Senator Bob Collins, has written to those states and that territory&mdash;Western Australia, Tasmania and the Australian Capital Territory&mdash;requesting them not to charge. Industry should not have to pay for delays brought about by the states and by slowness in the state sphere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I would also like to respond to the comments made by senators during the debate. Senator Brownhill made a thoughtful contribution to this debate. Senator Brownhill has indicated his support for the legislation but he is concerned that some states have indicated that they will not waiver their re-registration charges. Senator Calvert, too, has a made a thoughtful contribution. He has indicated his support for the legislation. He is concerned about those states which will continue charging and has indicated that he will pursue the matter in Tasmania with the relevant state minister. I should remind the chamber that Senator Calvert represents Tasmania in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell, also a Tasmanian, has raised three points. First, he referred to our failure to meet the 1 July 1994 commencement date and the need to extend the sunset clause because of that. As I said earlier, I am also disappointed that the states will not meet the timetable that the state ministers agreed with Senator Collins when it was set down. Secondly, Senator Bell made a reference to a chart which consisted of an octagon. I understand Professor Sellinger will be corresponding directly with Senator Bell concerning his comments on this matter. Thirdly, Senator Bell made comments about the form of public release summaries the National Registration Authority produces as a way to seek participation from the public. The NRA, the National Registration Authority, is on a steep learning curve in relation to the form of public release summary the community would find most useful. I understand that, in the light of comments received to date, the board of the authority will be considering the general form and content for public release summaries in the near future. I anticipate that that consideration will lead to a more focused approach by the authority and a better receptivity of it by the consuming public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza, the Deputy Liberal Whip in the Senate, again raised the issue of the price of agricultural and veterinary chemicals. I draw Senator Panizza's attention to the Prices Surveillance Authority's report of 1993 on the prices of farm chemicals. That report, in its conclusion, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The average price rises of farm chemicals over time have been relatively modest and therefore declaration of the industry under the terms of the Prices Surveillance Authority Act would appear inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA>I recognise, however, the concerns raised by Senator Panizza about the price of chemicals and respectfully suggest that he might wish to emulate the steps taken by his colleague Senator Calvert and raise these matters with the Western Australian state minister on the issue of state re-registration charges, as Senator Calvert is proposing to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;While not moving any amendments in the committee stage, I wish to take the opportunity to consider what the effect of the passage of this package of bills would be. I ask the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology (Senator Cook) whether he would consider ensuring that several things which could be done under this package of bills might be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In closing the debate on the second reading, the minister mentioned that several things could be done by individual senators and that that was the appropriate way to develop a nationally coordinated attitude to the legislation. He suggested, for example, that individual senators could approach their state governments to point out to them the inequity of continuing to charge re-registration fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the minister to consider, while these interim measures apply to the industry, the question of the capacity of the National Registration Authority to meet community service obligations. While the Democrats see the virtue of a national and consistent policy in this area, we are concerned that that national and consistent policy does not address the areas which are of concern to the chairman of the NRA. As mentioned at the committee of inquiry, it was the concern of the chairman that there is little capacity for the authority to consider community service obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that concern is well illustrated by the fact that, even while this registration regime is coming into place, there are problems associated with the use of chemicals. One quick and easy example of such problems was raised by me during earlier consideration of this matter, and that is that free containers of chemicals, sponsored by such groups as Landcare and Greening Australia&mdash;Senator Panizza would be interested to know this&mdash;are being issued to groups wishing to undertake activities on behalf of those admirable organisations and creating problems for the users. We have a situation where voluntary helpers, assisting in projects conducted by Landcare and Greening Australia, are being given containers of such fearful chemicals as paraquat. Having given of their time voluntarily, they are coming home with severe nosebleeds occasioned by the notorious anticoagulant paraquat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest that there is a question of liability here which has not and cannot be addressed at the moment by the National Registration Authority because it is not concerned with the control of use post sale. My question is: if the National Registration Authority is not concerned with use post sale, who is, and who will be concerned about these matters for the sake of the community?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe this proposed legislation, as well as the previous legislation establishing the authority, is inadequate and that it raises the most important question in this whole issue of chemicals in Australia. It is with a great degree of frustration that I speak during the committee stage of this bill to impose interim levy charges because I have not been able to find a vehicle for bringing about the change which seems to me to be so fundamentally necessary to the proper use of chemicals in Australia&mdash;and that disregards the whole debate about the appropriateness of chemical use, levels and cost, which it would be more appropriate to address in a different forum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this stage I ask for consideration of the question of where the capacity to meet community service obligations will be derived from and to whom that capacity will be delivered. This is a matter which has concerned the chairman of the NRA and which should be addressed while we are addressing these very bills. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question he puts to me, however, can be answered on several grounds, the first of which is that the post sale regulation of these chemicals is not a function under the constitution for the federal government of Australia; it is a function of the various state governments. I recognise Senator Bell's frustration, but it is at that tier of government that the responsibility should be accepted and taken because that is where the constitutional obligation lies. It is not for us to wash our hands of it but to point to the right authority for dealing with the issue. </PARA>

I know that they will not go to the point of what Senator Bell has raised specifically, but they are the explanational points that the Commonwealth can make, given where the constitutional authority lies.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write to inform you of the NUS position with regard to HECS repayments under PAYE and provisional taxation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NUS opposes HECS outright as a user pays mechanism for education which automatically limits access to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, while ever HECS exists NUS will work towards making the system as it currently stands more equitable for all students burdened with HECS repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NUS supports PAYE mechanisms for HECS repayments for the reason that without PAYE mechanisms, at the end of a financial year students are forced to pay a HECS bill upwards of $800.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the present time PAYE for HECS exemptions is optional where PAYE deductions are dependent upon employer consent. The current system sees many students denied access to this option through employer resistance and lack of information informing graduates of this option.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to provisional tax arrangements NUS has concerns that the levying of provisional tax on HECS debts will see an extra lump sum payment forced upon graduates who are provisional taxpayers. If however this method of payment is available in instalments (ie removing any lump sum payments) we believe that it lessens the burden on graduates and should be supported.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We understand that the Opposition moved amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No 2 1994 which would delete the provisional tax arrangements for HECS repayments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We see no reason to do this unless this will increase up front payments for HECS debts for graduates. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">NUS is extremely concerned at the lack of notice given to students with regard to these changes introduced by the Government (ie six weeks before the bill had even been passed by the Parliament). We seek an immediate extension of the start date to at least 1 Jan 1995.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write regarding amendments to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) moved by yourself yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Tertiary Education Union represents approximately 25,000 staff employed in tertiary education, most of them in higher education institutions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While we oppose HECS on the basis of our opposition to user-pays measures in higher education, we believe that where such measures exist they should be administered as fairly and equitably as possible. Therefore, we support the announcement in the 1993 Higher Education Budget Statement that HECS will be repaid through PAYE or provisional tax arrangements. This removes the onus on graduates to pay a lump sum at the end of the year, and ensures their right to access this option via their employer.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While it is the AVCC's position that it would prefer that all access to higher education should be provided through Government funding, it has recognised that there are limitations on the funding that can be allocated to higher education.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AVCC has, therefore, accepted and endorsed the introduction of HECS as an acceptable instrument to introduce an element of funding from those who benefit personally from university education. There has been wide acceptance of HECS, documented in successive reports from the Higher Education Council, and universities have welcomed the increased funding which HECS has provided for the expansion of the system which has occurred since 1988.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Federal Government proposed, in its 1993-94 Budget, a number of changes to the Higher Education Contribution Scheme (HECS), although the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee (AVCC) raised concerns about the administration implications of and some of the retrospective aspects of the proposed changes, it did not oppose the changes as there was recognition of the justification for the position and the equity arguments which supported it. No AVCC comment was made on the changes proposed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With respect to the changes proposed which would allow recovery of HECS through the PAYE and Provisional Tax systems, it was clear that this would be of positive benefit to students, in the rationalisation of HECS repayments over the financial year, rather than the imposition of a large debt, additional to tax assessment, at the end of the financial year. In the absence of the more radical changes to the HECS structure, there is implicit AVCC support for the introduction of measures such as this which are of practical benefit to students.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have accepted in good faith that these bodies and groups are acting in the best interests of their students. Initially, I was surprised by the opposition to the stance we have taken&mdash;for example, some of the draconian provisions requiring employers effectively to garnishee wages at the request of the ATO. On the other hand, having been given the opportunity of the weekend for reflection and for discussing the matter with individual students, I believe that, as parliamentarians, we should reflect the views of those constituencies that are subject to this legislation. Acknowledging that point of view, listening to these groups is a proper and appropriate parliamentary procedure because, having weighed the pain against the gain, they would like us to pass this legislation without amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is considerable gain, and I will reiterate some of the criticisms I raised earlier because I do not want to shrink from the seriousness of the issues we raised. So this should not be regarded so much as a backdown on the principles we espoused but as a desire to meet the genuine concerns of the students, on balance. As outlined in the letters that have been incorporated, there are features about which the students are unhappy. Therefore, we withdraw those amendments since they do not meet with the full approval of those constituencies, after due consideration and debate within those organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those groups&mdash;the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the National Tertiary Education Industry Union and the National Union of Students&mdash;have asked us to withdraw those issues, and I do so. As honourable senators would appreciate, it has not been an easy task, but it is one that is in the best interests of the democratic processes of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should not take much heart from this changed position because the issues I have raised as issues have really not diminished: that is, changing the rules between individuals and the government after they have been agreed upon, which is a serious issue that has all the hallmarks of retrospectivity; placing onerous conditions on employers that were not previously imposed in relation to the new measures; and failing to outline the financial impact in the explanatory memorandum of the training guarantee funding legislation in relation to particular amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now standard practice, and I congratulate the Taxation Office, in relation to tax bills that wherever an amendment occurs a financial impact is given in relation to  the particular clause or group of clauses. Unfortunately, the training guarantee funding legislation contained no such detailed breakdown, although there was an overall figure. The executive sending letters ahead of the passage of legislation really goes to the sovereignty of this parliament and is still a very real issue. I remind the committee that the philosopher Montesquieu was right when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the legislature and executive powers are united, there indeed can be no liberty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I mentioned earlier the draconian nature of the PAYE payments. If an employee fails to complete a new declaration form, the employer will be advised by the Taxation Office to deduct tax at the maximum rate of 48.4 per cent, regardless of the employee's income. We are certainly heading down this path. The parliament, through the executive, has given the ATO not only extra powers but also extra responsibilities&mdash;collecting revenue, the superannuation guarantee charge, child support, the training guarantee levy, which is currently in suspension, perhaps a role as the nation's banker for small amounts of superannuation, and now additional powers in relation to bringing forth HECS amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill before us today talks about notional and unrealised accruals, deemed capital gains when underlying investments have not been sold, and profits attributable to trusts when there is no beneficial change in the ownership of the asset. On Monday afternoon I had a very interesting discussion with one of the student representatives, Rebecca Shinnick&mdash;she does not mind me mentioning her name&mdash;of the students association of the Adelaide university. She calls for an assurance from the government that students who undertake holiday employment prior to the completion of their courses will not be subject to the onerous PAYE HECS arrangements in the light of what has been foreshadowed, particularly in relation to the pro rata legislation that has yet to come before the chamber, and this legislation is certainly the forerunner of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will open a pandora's box for the government but particularly for the Taxation Office and the constituents who will be affected. The implementation of these measures will not be easy for anyone. Had the government listened to the views we raised during the committee stage, it certainly would have had more time to reflect and perhaps get some of these issues right. I am worried about the impact on employers, on those who will be affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already indicated, the government has already foreshadowed legislation affecting the pro rata amendments, especially operating from 1 January 1995. Perhaps I should give an opportunity to other colleagues to respond in relation to HECS matters before I proceed to other issues, because I know that other senators do have issues to raise in relation to the HECS provision. If that is not the case I will proceed to consideration of the capital gains issues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain what Senator Watson would like to have happen. If by `colleagues' he means his colleagues in the coalition, then I will certainly exclude myself from contributing on that line. But if he means that it might be logical to keep considering HECS business until that is out of the way and we are then able to deal with other matters in the bill, I will be glad to oblige.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson has withdrawn his previously circulated amendments, and I think it is only right and proper that I respond to that action. During my speech on the second reading, I indicated on behalf of the Democrats that we would be supporting those amendments. We had good reasons for that, and I enunciated them during the debate. As far as we are concerned, those reasons have not changed. I commend Senator Watson for his earlier efforts to this stage regarding those HECS taxation changes. It is with some regret that I notice there has been some pressure applied and lobbying has occurred which has caused a change in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can characterise what has happened in a number of ways. What often happens to the Democrats when a reconsideration is being made is that quite a lot of hyperbole is heaped upon us, and suggestions are made, particularly by people such as Senator Macdonald, that there is some hint of a deal. I could ask what sort of sleazy deal has been done on this occasion, but I will not because I know that Senator Watson does not need that sort of invective to be applied to him, and he has explained that he believes, as a parliamentarian, he should be taking notice of the views of constituent organisations. I appreciate that, but it is unfortunate that the executive of some groups, particularly the National Union of Students, has chosen to support the government without the rigorous scrutiny that should be applied to such issues, and without, I believe, the opportunity for proper consideration of the concerns of their constituent members, many of whom have contacted me on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The individual members of these organisations could not possibly have had the opportunity to provide input to their executive before the executive changed its mind. I will, without asking for permission because it is on the public record, remind the Senate that the President of the National Union of Students, Penny Sharpe, wrote an article which was published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS>. It pointed out quite clearly the inequities of the government's proposition and the NUS's opposition to it. Now, without any explanation, we have an entirely opposite position being put on behalf of the National Union of Students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only reasons that we read in the letters that have been incorporated by Senator Watson&mdash;and rightly so&mdash;are very lame attempts to justify a change of mind. The reasons are that some students would be disadvantaged by having to pay a lump sum at the end of the year in which their HECS liability becomes applicable. I suggest that there are many reasons to show that that is a very lame justification for a change of mind. At the moment students have the capacity to pay fortnightly if they think that such a lump sum obligation would be difficult. It is possible to pay fortnightly through the PAYE system under, I believe, section 221D of the Taxation Act. It is also possible, as many wise students already do, to ask their bank to put aside money into nominated special savings accounts with the electronic transfer of funds that the banking system has at the moment. I have been contacted by students who are doing this. They are finding that being paid interest on those payments is much more satisfactory than voluntarily overpaying their tax and giving the Australian government the use of some several hundred dollars gratis for the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who in their right mind would want to involve themselves in a deliberate overpayment of tax just so that the Australian government could have the use of their money for an extra year? I have yet to meet hundreds of those people. There are many people who do it; they find that enforced savings is perhaps a better way to save. They are the ones who cannot resist the temptation to gain access to their money when it is in the bank. There are people who do that; it is human nature. But I suggest it is also human nature to consider that an obligation in the future is one that may be lessened. When one is a little desperate for money it is also human nature to see whether there may not be an opportunity to lessen that debt in the future. That is precisely what we all do with our taxation obligations and the opportunity for refunds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">HECS is not a tax; it is a levy, a contribution scheme. When faced with the possibility that there will be a future obligation, many people would rather put it out of their minds and ignore it. But this will not go away. As far as the government is concerned, those who do not pay it have not got away with anything. They have not committed a crime, but they have deferred their debt and are liable to pay it when their taxable income reaches $26,408. With these changes, the money will be collected by the government not on taxable income in the interim sense but on the gross income. Of course, many students who have graduated and are receiving their first salaries, do not cross that threshold. If they do, pro rata, cross it during the year, at the end of the taxation year, there is every chance that&mdash;and there are several people caught at this threshold&mdash;a few deductions will bring them under that threshold. The Taxation Office will say, `Yes, fine. They will get a refund.', but the point to be made is that they have been disadvantaged for the entire year by those payments being removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These are the very arguments that Senator Watson agreed with and the coalition had appreciated, notwithstanding the very many arguments that have been put on behalf of employers. Senator Panizza, who I notice is in the chamber, put forward a very convincing argument about the increasing imposition of compliance costs to employers. I wonder what it is about the NUS position which has changed Senator Panizza's mind. I agreed entirely with what he had said, and the Democrats, on behalf of small business, have been agreeing with Senator Panizza's criticisms of what the government is doing. I cannot see how a letter from the NUS which says that some students find it convenient to be saddled with a bulk payment at the end of the taxation year has influenced Senator Panizza, and those many others, who rightly put that criticism on behalf of employers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could stand here and remind the chamber of the many cogent arguments that were put on behalf of the coalition for agreeing with its amendments. I could stand here and remind members of the coalition of the things that have been said, such as Senator Watson's statement on 1 June that this government was overriding the rights of this parliament in issuing letters to students from the Taxation Office outlining what the obligations were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could also remind the parliament of what Senator Teague said. I remind the chamber that Senator Short has already achieved the passage of a second reading amendment which condemns the government for including the higher education contribution debt in the provisional tax regime. Is the coalition going to walk away from that? Senator Teague made quite a play of this. He supported it and added to its weight. The essence of Senator Teague's contribution was to point out the lack of consultation. He had pursued the matter in the estimates committee and, for some hours, had taken pains to develop a case which pointed out the lack of consultation with students on this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, Senator Teague pointed out&mdash;I thought quite brilliantly&mdash;the fallacy of the government's claim that there had been consultation. He pointed out that the National Union of Students had received what is probably best called a description of the legislation by the relevant departmental officers, but certainly no opportunity to effect any change because that description was given one day before the budget was delivered. Senator Teague rightly pointed out that that could hardly be called consultation; it was information giving, and nothing more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would suggest that if, after that briefing, the National Union of Students had been impressed by the government's magnanimous benefit being introduced for and on behalf of students, reducing their need to find that lump sum, surely it would have issued a statement recognising that. Did it do that? Of course it did not. At that time the union did anything but recognise that it was a wonderful thing. In fact, the union criticised it, and rightly so, for all the various reasons that I have just outlined and that have been outlined by the coalition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Union of Students disagreed with the coalition at that time. At that time the coalition said that it would be happy to accept those changes, but enlightenment came and it recognised the fault with it, and was impressed by what the students had to say. As I mentioned earlier, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 25 May Penny Sharpe, the President of the NUS, was quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This change directly affects graduates who are employed in project-based work. The Government is yet to detail what effect this change will have on part-time and casual workers, but it could lead to students having to pay HECS out of earnings made during university holidays.</PARA>
<PARA>Earlier, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Students . . . will still feel the effects of the "administrative changes" and many will be further disadvantaged in trying to finance their way through university education.</PARA>
<PARA>That accurate rendition of what the changes meant was published by the NUS. As well as that, on Thursday, 2 June the University of South Australia Students Association supported the Democrats and the federal coalition for taking on the threat of a double dissolution and opposing recovery of the higher education contribution scheme through provisional taxation and PAYE taxation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those were the expressions of opinion then; we find that they have changed, and all of a sudden the coalition runs along behind the changes. I welcome that, but I wonder whether that means we will see the coalition agreeing with all the other longstanding NUS policy stances on universal free education; on increased levels of Austudy and wider eligibility, unlike the Fightback provisions; and on a reduction in the Austudy independent rate age from 22 to 21 and then to 18 years of age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is the coalition going to go into bat on these matters? Is it going to have a boost for higher education research funding infrastructure? Is it going to go into bat for rent assistance for all Austudy recipients? Is it going to support universal membership of student organisations? I want Senator Abetz to come in here and tell me what his stance is on that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology to explain how a person who is liable to pay HECS&mdash;and I am not arguing about the liability for payment&mdash;will manage if he is also caught up with the child support scheme. If a person is earning about $30,000, he is liable for HECS. But if he also has two children for whom he has to pay maintenance under the child support scheme, he will, I believe, be paying tax of about $6,500 and a Medicare levy of about $500, leaving him with a net income of approximately $23,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The calculation under the child support scheme for two children would mean that he would be liable for maintenance of approximately $6,000, which is calculated on his taxable income of $30,000. I think I am right in understanding that his HECS liability is also calculated on the basis of his taxable income, namely the $30,000, but in fact he has only about $16,000 a year left when that HECS liability is extracted from his income, which will leave him with about $15,000 a year to live on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the act make any provision for the liability to pay HECS to be spread slightly more thinly for the person who is paying moneys under the child support scheme rather than having to pay it at the same rate as a person who is not caught up with the child support scheme? Has this aspect been considered? I am not suggesting in these remarks that either of the amounts of liability should be changed, but I am very acutely aware, as I think most members of parliament are, that the operation of the child support scheme is having a fairly devastating effect on the ability of many Australians to live&mdash;to get by at all&mdash;because it does not take into account any other absolutely reasonable commitments that a person may have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A person may need a car to earn any income at all, but the liability for the cost of the motor vehicle is not taken into account in assessing either the HECS or the child support commitment. Every aspect of life, every aspect of his commitments, even debts of his former wife for which he is liable, all come out of that available income of about $16,000. The impact of both the Child Support Agency payment, and certainly the additional impact of the HECS repayment, is very substantial indeed. I have kept my remarks very brief. I would appreciate the minister's answer, but I would also say to the minister that I think perhaps beyond today it is a matter that needs to be looked at and consideration given to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be other people paying HECS who have commitments and children to support. I am tempted to say that the operation of the Child Support Agency is vicious, but that is not fair to those who administer it. The formula that the Department of Social Security imposes is very severe at the present time. Hopefully, that might be changed at some stage, but it is an aspect of the two bills that does not seem to have been meshed in any way. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to take this opportunity to say a few words on the debate thus far, not in the interests of prolonging it unnecessarily but in the interests of clarifying the position of the government on where we are up to. Firstly, I confirm that Senator Watson has asked me whether, if he submits some technical and complicated questions and we answer them later, we can seek to have them regarded as part of this debate and, for the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act, have answers that would be on the record in addressing the meaning of the act.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I acknowledge that. It is often the case in this chamber that we debate these things and the parliament is seen, external to this chamber, as a fractious and disruptive place in which none of us can ever agree on anything. I acknowledge about Senator Watson's action that, when he put forward his amendments, he did so based on the information he had at the time and on the obligation that information imposed on him as an opposition spokesperson on this bill to seek those amendments. That was done honestly in recognition of the concerns he saw of his constituents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then, as he has reported to this chamber, he has had access to further information&mdash;more specific and better particulars&mdash;and, as a consequence of later information, he wishes to change his position. I acknowledge that. Often, consistency is seen as the bugbear of small minds. This is an example of someone who is intellectually rigorous and honest enough to recognise that circumstances change cases and better information can change outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not always the case that those who answer the calling of politics are as courageous and honest in recognising change when the circumstances require that change to occur. But it has to be said&mdash;let me pay the compliment&mdash;that that is not true of Senator Watson. He has had the intellectual courage to recognise that there is different information. While that does not mean to say that he supports the government case in all respects&mdash;indeed, he is a scathing critic of the government's case in some respects&mdash;at the point of outcome, nonetheless, he is prepared to not proceed with his amendments. I acknowledge that as a dignified, graceful and honest effort to reconcile himself to the circumstances. I pay tribute to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not surprisingly, also, the Australian Democrats, who now feel abandoned because of that action, seek to exercise their political right to make political capital out of it. Senator Bell has done so at some length. I still maintain my position with him that, while he has been consistent about HECS, in these circumstances the appropriate thing would be to have  consensus in this chamber and join the majority view of both the opposition and the government. However, he will persist in his course as he sees fit. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I table and present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Bougainville, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bougainville: a Pacific solution</EMPHASIS>. It is a report of the visit of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Bougainville from 18 to 22 April 1994. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The title of our report, as I have just mentioned, is <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bougainville: a Pacific solution</EMPHASIS>. It is the unanimous view of our delegation that the crisis on Bougainville which has existed for nearly six years is capable of a Pacific solution. It ought to be a Pacific solution which prevails, and the time for that solution to be achieved is now. It should be achieved principally by Papua New Guinea but in cooperation with its neighbours and friends, including Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tragedy of Bougainville cannot be adequately described in words before the Senate this morning. This war has been very costly in lives; untold lives have been lost. It has been very costly in terms of the damage done to families on the island and on the neighbouring islands. It has been very damaging to communities in terms of the hardship and dislocation which have been inflicted by the conflict on ordinary people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last six years have seen lost opportunities, primarily in education of young people. It has seen lost entitlements in health and services. It has seen lost aspirations in work, family life and community involvement. It is very encouraging therefore to see the process which seems to be unfolding at the moment in the discussions between the government of Papua New Guinea and the Bougainville secessionists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a privilege in every sense of the word for me to present this report to the Senate this morning. It represents unanimous views in terms of its findings, conclusions and recommendations. Our delegation represented all shades of opinion in the Australian parliament. At the outset I would like to acknowledge my fellow delegates&mdash;the deputy leader, Mr Sinclair; Senator Bourne from the Australian Democrats; Senator Calvert from the Liberal Party; and my friend and colleague Mr Knott from the ALP&mdash;all of whom contributed both in work done during the visit and in the preparation of this report and its supporting documentation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to acknowledge the contributions of the two prime ministers, Messrs Wingti and Keating, who were supportive from the time the idea was first raised. I offer a particular acknowledgment to the foreign ministers of Papua New Guinea and Australia, Sir Julius Chan and Senator Gareth Evans, who saw this idea through to fruition and reality. In terms of the manner in which our delegation was able to visit Bougainville and talk with people on the island and beyond, I make a special acknowledgment to Bill Farmer, our High Commissioner, and his staff in Port Moresby. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The terms of reference were very clear: to look at circumstances on Bougainville, to look at possibilities for a political solution, to look at reconstruction and rehabilitation, to look at human rights circumstances and to look overall at the possible role that Australia might play and the support which Australia might offer. All members of the delegation went to Bougainville with open minds. We sought not to pre-judge the issues. We realised that the six-year war which had raged had been far too long and far too bloody for anyone to arrive and, in a few days, make all the pronouncements and draw all the conclusions. But we wanted to listen and observe, and discuss with people, particularly those most affected, just how a solution might be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go to the grave with the sight of Arawa general hospital burnt to the ground. Regardless of who was responsible for an atrocity such as that, I do not think any of us in the delegation will ever put out of our minds the sight of the buildings and facilities of Arawa general hospital, its magnificent equipment, its capacity to deliver services to the people of the island, in ruins. It was the finest facility of its kind in the south west Pacific and it was one of those terrible casualties of a war. The human cost has been very great. The cost in services to the people of Bougainville has been enormous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our delegation grew aware very quickly of the payback cycle which is still occurring on the island. In the Sohano general hospital we talked with young soldiers of the Papua New Guinea defence forces who had been wounded in a fire fight which had occurred just recently. One young soldier in particular made the point that the BRA soldier who had shot him, whom he knew personally, had already been killed by his friends in the Resistance, in the Papua New Guinea militia. That cycle has to be broken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, our delegation at Tonu saw a reconciliation ceremony which was very moving and indicative of the prospects for peace. It suggested a way forward. We saw, for example, several score of former BRA soldiers being welcomed back into the local community at Tonu and Konga. One very prominent citizen was the widow of Mr Tony Anugu, a national MP who had been murdered during the course of the conflict by the BRA. She stood there, tears streaming down her face, welcoming former BRA soldiers back into the fold of the local community. We were all very moved by that and I underline that that reconciliation part of the Bougainvillian culture is very important for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we returned to Australia, as Senator Calvert and I have mentioned in this place, we learned again of the terrible impact of rumours on Bougainville with the assault upon Sir Paul Lupun and his family. Sir Paul, a very distinguished Bougainvillian who has served in the national parliament on a previous occasion and has been part of landmark decisions affecting the island for the better, was assaulted because there was some rumour that the Australian delegation had given him 30,000 kina for speaking with him. His home was burnt to the ground and his family terrorised. I understand from Sir Julius Chan, with whom I raised the matter last week, that Sir Paul has recovered, which is very good news. But the impact of rumour on the island on fringe elements, on criminals and on those who would resort to the power of the gun to achieve an easy political end very cheaply can never be minimised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So we saw the need, we saw the dislocation, we saw the hardship. We learnt of the Australian role. The Australian role has been generous in terms of our aid and assistance. It has been effective: it has been supportive. I place on record the manner in which we were assisted by AIDAB throughout the time that we were on Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an Australian obligation. There is no question of that. I think everyone in the parliament is aware of that. In earlier colonial times perhaps we did not always act with the sensitivity that certain circumstances required. Perhaps at Panguna Australians in a private capacity could also have acted with greater sensitivity. There are legitimate grievances on Bougainville, there are real concerns and there are genuine issues that have to be addressed in the course of finding a peaceful settlement. But everyone within our delegation is absolutely convinced, as a consequence of our visit between 18 and 22 April, that there is no military resolution to the conflict whatsoever. The PNGDF cannot crush the secessionists by force of arms and neither can secession be won by force of arms. The bloodshed is entirely futile. We hoped that our delegation would act as a catalyst for a peaceful settlement and a circuit breaker. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We travelled extensively on the island. We talked widely and openly to people. We had effective dialogue with people. We talked directly and honestly with people in the care centres and beyond at Loloho, Arawa, Wakunai, Tonu and Konga. We talked with people about their concerns, their fears, and their aspirations. We were accompanied by two Papua New Guinean MPs who assisted us greatly. We saw the rehabilitation and reconstruction that was under way, particularly at Tonu and Konga, which was very encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that visit, we have made a series of recommendations detailed in chapter 6 of our report, again agreed unanimously. I will deal with several of them in the brief time available to me. I reiterate: there is no military solution; a cease-fire must be brought into being. Both sides ought to commit themselves to that end and to that objective. There should be talks. The talks that are apparently under way, as reported in this morning's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, are very encouraging. The island of Bougainville ought, over time, progressively to be opened up to humanitarian assistance, to non-government organisations, to the churches&mdash;in particular, the Catholic church has experienced some problems recently&mdash;to the media for scrutiny and to more MPs from neighbouring countries in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The greater the involvement in a peace process the better the result will be. The dialogue between the parties to the conflict, which apparently is in the process of being established, in a secure environment, is absolutely critical. We really do not want to see any more breakdowns in the form of the Honiara and Endeavour accords. It is encouraging that the process apparently advanced so far in private does augur well for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been human rights problems on the island that have been extensively documented by Amnesty International on both sides of the conflict. There needs to be a process of accountability. Those responsible must be brought to justice. At times an amnesty might be appropriate; compensation might be appropriate to break the cycle of payback. Reconciliation is certainly an integral part of the Bougainvillian culture and needs to be brought to bear. Overall, our delegation is of the very firm and clear view that the rule of law must return to the island as the security situation is guaranteed and as the peace process unfolds and is applied with an even hand and fairly. That is why the announcement by Prime Minister Wingti of the Human Rights Commission and the police complaints unit to be established on Buka Island is so positive and so encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We talked of the framework which might enable the peace process to go forward. We looked at a very definite time frame, and an agreed agenda and chair for the talks. We also looked at Australian technical assistance for border management with the Solomons to resolve the problems that have characterised the border over the last five to six years. There is an Australian role in promoting talks and discussion and underpinning the process&mdash;there is no question about that. There is a further role for Australia in reconstruction and rehabilitation once the peace process has resulted in a settlement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last week as a courtesy I took an advance copy of our report to Port Moresby for Prime Minister Wingti and Foreign Minister Sir Julius Chan to enable Papua New Guinea to respond very close to the time at which Senator Evans will deliver the Australian government's response. Could I say, without breaking the confidentiality of the discussions I had, that I was very encouraged by their response. They were pleased with the fact that Australia has sought to play a constructive and positive role, and that we have been very serious in our examination at both parliamentary and government levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am encouraged also by the letter which I have received from and the discussions I have had with Mr Moses Havini, the representative in Australia of the Bougainville interim government. Again, without breaking the confidentiality of those discussions, that was a positive response. So there is no question that the groundwork is there for discussions to continue and to produce results in terms of an atmosphere of trust over time being established. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the manner in which the delegation was able to work on Bougainville, I must acknowledge the contribution of the fourth estate&mdash;the media&mdash;both Australian and Papua New Guinean, who travelled with us. What we saw, they saw. In that respect, they were able to report very accurately on circumstances on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In mentioning circumstances on the island, the overwhelming sentiment of everyone with whom we talked&mdash;be they officials or military; be they people in the care agencies; be they people who were local community leaders; be they ordinary folk, because our delegation at times broke up and walked right out into the middle of the crowds to talk with people about their needs and their concerns&mdash;is for peace, for a negotiated settlement, and for a return to harmony and normalcy. The values of the people of Bougainville Island are very much like the values of our own communities in Australia. We could detect almost no difference. People wanted their children to be able to go to school; they wanted their families to be able to live in peace; they wanted work for people; they wanted communities to be able to prosper. Of course, at the moment, that is simply impossible on most of the island. Prospects have probably not been better for a peaceful settlement. The chances for reconciliation have probably not been more promising than they are at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to conclude my brief remarks with a quote about another war that ought never to have been fought, a tragedy that ought never to have occurred. I refer to the remarks of Senator Robert Francis Kennedy on 18 March 1968, when he broke with President Lyndon Johnson on the Vietnam War. Senator Kennedy said about bringing that war to an end&mdash;his words apply with equal force and equal integrity to the war that has savaged Bougainville Island:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be ended and it can be ended in a peace of brave men who have fought each other with a terrible fury, each believing that he alone was in the right . . . Now, while there is still time for some [of their prayers] to be partly answered, now is the time to stop.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to give the government's response to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bougainville: a Pacific solution</EMPHASIS>, a report of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Bougainville, 18 to 22 April 1994. It is very unusual for a government response to be made simultaneously with the tabling of such a report, but this is an unusually important report. It has an unusual background, prepared, as it was, at the request of the government. In order to maintain the momentum that has been generated already by the delegation visit and the report, it is very important that the government's reaction to it be made clear and put on the public record as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a report which we very warmly welcome. Australian ministers first raised the idea of such a visit at the PNG-Australia Ministerial Forum held in Mount Hagen last December. Our Papua New Guinean counterparts reacted positively to this proposal, and in February this year Prime Minister Wingti conveyed his government's formal agreement during his visit to Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We proposed the visit against a background of widespread concern, not only in Australia but in other parts of the world, about the intractability of the conflict in Papua New Guinea's North Solomons Province and about humanitarian conditions on the island and reported human rights abuses to which the conflict had given rise. We repeated the view we have previously expressed on a number of occasions that a long-term solution to the Bougainville problem could not be achieved by military means and suggested that an independent examination could be an important contribution toward genuine efforts to bring the conflict to an end. This objective made it desirable that the delegation include a broad range of political affiliations, which it did. That the delegation's report is a unanimous one is all the more welcome; its unanimity makes the report itself all the more compelling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The delegation's visit has been very successful in two important respects.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first of these is in having provided an authoritative eyewitness account of the current situation on Bougainville and in providing the Australian parliament and the Australian community with access to the views of ordinary Bougainvillean men and women, unfiltered by spokespersons seeking to promote the views or cause of any one side. The delegation makes clear in its report its overwhelming impression that the people of Bougainville, above all, desire peace and a return to normal life. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so the report also helps to dispel some of the misrepresentations which propagandists have promoted, especially here in Australia. I refer, for instance, to allegations which continue to enjoy some currency, including among some groups which should know better, that PNG government-run care centres for displaced Bougainvilleans are nothing but concentration camps; that PNG security forces are engaged in some kind of hostile occupation of the island; and that the BRA continues to enjoy widespread support in the province. This report has given no comfort to any of those claims. At the same time it gives a very succinct account of the very complex and diverse nature of Bougainvillean society, which is often overlooked in quick assessments of the situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the delegation visit has, I think, itself served to encourage renewed Papua New Guinean efforts to seek out a peaceful solution. This report provides useful suggestions as to how a peace process might develop on the PNG side while at the same time stating a possible basis for an appropriate Australian contribution to the process. It does not lay down a prescriptive, detailed blueprint for peace; it does clarify the very real issues that do need to be addressed. It underlines the importance of Papua New Guinea's friends being prepared to play a supportive role in facilitating a peaceful resolution of the problem, and it does provide a basis for further discussions with the PNG government on ways in which that role might best be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However much we might want to help, the fact is that no amount of shouting from the sidelines can enforce peace on Bougainville. The Australian government remains convinced that no lasting resolution of the Bougainville problem is possible unless the parties involved themselves want to reach a resolution, commit themselves to doing so and assume responsibility for maintaining a resolution once it is reached. In Bougainville, as in all other aspects of our relationship, Australia cannot, should not and will not try to solve Papua New Guinea's problems for it. That is why Australia's position has always been that it would not be appropriate for us to seek a primary role in mediating or brokering a peaceful resolution on Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that does not mean that there is no role for Australia. The delegation's report makes, as I have said, a number of sensible suggestions in this regard. In particular it suggests that Australia might offer to facilitate talks between the parties. The government welcomes this recommendation; indeed, such an offer has been on the table for some time and was renewed most recently at the highest level during Prime Minister Wingti's visit to Australia in February. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government endorses the delegation's belief that humanitarian considerations demand that the Papuan New Guinean government explore, as a priority, ways in which basic humanitarian supplies such as medicines and clothes can be delivered to all parts of Bougainville. The government believes such a gesture would also represent a significant step in the process of rebuilding confidence among the various parties on Bougainville as a necessary foundation for a lasting resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the report notes, Australia clearly has a role to play in assisting the rehabilitation and reconstruction of the province. Again, this is an area where the Australian government is already active, with over $7 million already spent or committed for relief and rehabilitation activities in North Solomons Province, through both government agencies and NGOs. We are prepared to devote additional resources to this area, and an additional $7.5 million is notionally set aside for this purpose. But it is important to note that the scope for delivery of significant additional assistance does depend, to an important degree, on an improvement in the security situation in the province. This in turn will depend on progress towards a peaceful resolution of the conflict. And, as I said previously, this is something for which all parties bear a responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government endorses the report's recommendations in relation to the issues of human rights and accountability. Again, the report does not seek to be prescriptive in terms of process, but offers helpful suggestions in identifying those issues it perceives must be addressed, including in particular the need for all cases to be dealt with equally, and the need to respect traditional Bougainvillean compensation processes. The government warmly welcomes the announcement by Prime Minister Wingti on 31 May that Papua New Guinea is to establish a national human rights commission, and an associated police complaints unit in North Solomons Province.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that the delegation's visit and its meetings with senior members of the Papua New Guinea government, including the Prime Minister, have been a factor in this decision. The delegation's report recommends that, should Papua New Guinea decide to establish a national human rights commission, Australia be prepared to give technical advice and assistance to such a commission using the resources of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in Australia. We will certainly be happy to ask the Australian commission to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No-one should trivialise the very real difficulties in the path of those seeking to bring an end to the Bougainville conflict. North Solomons is not the only province in Papua New Guinea suffering from shortages of essential supplies; the PNG government's resources are not infinite; communications are limited; the conflict is complex, and divisions are deep and numerous; and the expectations of many are unrealistic. But this does not detract from the judgment that this conflict has gone on too long. And it is clear from the report of the delegation that this view is very widely held on Bougainville too. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those parties who remain opposed to Papua New Guinea sovereignty in the North Solomons are faced with a choice: to continue pursuing their political objectives through violence and intimidation, or to set these aside in the interests of allowing ordinary Bougainvilleans to resume their normal lives, to educate their children, to cultivate their food gardens, to plant their crops, and to travel freely. Compromise must be seen to come from all sides. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the government's sincere hope that the delegation's report will encourage all those involved in the Bougainville situation to think more seriously about peace and about the steps needed to bring it about, and to take at least the first of those steps without waiting for others to set the pace. The government has, in this respect, welcomed the recent confirmation by the Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister, Sir Julius Chan, that he has held discussions with South Pacific nations on ways in which they might help to bring an end to the conflict. It may be that, depending on the task envisaged, Australia could play a role in supporting a small regional peacekeeping force, established to facilitate a peace process. This has not yet been put to us as a detailed proposal, and we await further elaboration of the concept. We would certainly consider any such proposal very sympathetically.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These recent moves do signal a renewed willingness on the part of the Papua New Guinea government to devote more attention and more resources to bringing about an end to the Bougainville conflict by peaceful means. I have encouraged my counterpart, Sir Julius, to persist in this endeavour, and I most warmly welcome the latest news that senior level talks in fact took place in Honiara last weekend between Papua New Guinea officials and representatives of the BRA and its associates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task of this Australian delegation was not an easy one in the light of Australia's historical relationship with Papua New Guinea, and a degree of controversy surrounding Australia's continued financial assistance and defence support to the Papua New Guinea government. But Senator Loosley, the chairman, and all the other members of the delegation&mdash;Ian Sinclair, Vicki Bourne, Paul Calvert and Peter Knott&mdash;carried out their task with sensitivity, diligence, and a high seriousness of purpose. The government very warmly commends all members of the delegation and also those officials who supported them for their commitment to this very important exercise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to place on record my particular appreciation of the efforts of officers of the Australian High Commission in Port Moresby, who made a significant contribution to the success of the visit in planning and overseeing what was a particularly complex logistical exercise involving helicopter transportation in difficult terrain in what remains, regrettably, an uncertain security environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The success of the visit would not have been possible without the active cooperation and assistance at the highest levels of the Papua New Guinea government and its officials, the civilian administration of the North Solomons Province, and the Papua New Guinea security forces. Finally, I would like to take this opportunity formally to register the Australian government's sincere thanks for this, and in particular to express my appreciation for the personal interest of Prime Minister Paias Wingti and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Sir Julius Chan, both of whom received the delegation following its return from Bougainville on 22 April, and who have continued to take an intense interest in the delegation's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too would like to make some brief remarks about the visit of the Australian parliamentary delegation to Bougainville. I make the point from the outset that whilst one is in opposition one does not very often get the opportunity to do something positive for this country. I certainly appreciate the opportunity given to me by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Gareth Evans, and also by my then leader, Dr John Hewson, to be part of this delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the comments made so far that it was certainly a very timely visit&mdash;a circuit-breaker, as I think Senator Loosley called it. From my own observations, I would say that all parties involved certainly needed an excuse to get together, and we provided it. This report embodies what happened while we were there but, since then, everything has been happening around it. As Senator Loosley said, a lot of this is because of the positive press, particularly from Mary-Louise O'Callaghan who joined us on the delegation, and Lucy Palmer and Sean Dorney. Today I was very encouraged to see in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> the comments about Senator Loosley, who did a fine job leading the delegation. Over the last few weeks he has shown very fine diplomatic skills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we all agree that the ball has to keep rolling, that we cannot afford to stop and look back. Presenting this report personally to Sir Julius Chan was a very fine move. Today I read in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> that Francis Ona, the acknowledged president of the Bougainville resistance people, has made statements calling for peace, and supportive of the pan-Bougainville process. I think that really makes all members of the delegation feel the time we spent there was most worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Senator Loosley that the Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Mr Paias Wingti, and Sir Julius Chan should be congratulated for the way they took us in, the openness of their approach to the whole matter and the way in which they have it followed through. Sir Julius has been having talks behind the scenes as an ongoing process, and the foreign minister noted this in the government's response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been stated, when we went there we all had different views, some perhaps more way-out than others, but it was very pleasing at the finish to see that we all came up with the same result. Not only that, but another report by the Catholic bishops in PNG from people on the ground which came out not long after ours virtually supported the comments and suggestions that we made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that there is no substitute for having been there. In 1988 I visited Bougainville as a member of a delegation with Bob McMullan, Robert Tickner, Warwick Smith, Michael Lee and Alasdair Webster. My impression of that particular island was that it was an island paradise with a great future in tourism. We went to Arawa island where I saw the hospital and visited the provincial headquarters that had just been completed that people were so proud of. When I went back there as part of this delegation I saw the havoc that has been created over the whole island and particularly around Arawa. As mentioned by Senator Loosley, the hospital has been burned to the ground, the hotel we stayed at has been flattened and the provincial headquarters of which the people were so proud is being used as a temporary shelter by refugees. One could see, although it had been wrecked and ruined, what a marvellous building it had been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The town itself was just a deserted ghost town. Importantly, though, most of the housing seemed to be intact. Once security is returned to the area, perhaps life can go on, because it was a thriving town of 10,000 people. Aarawa reminded me very much of Rabaul before it was wrecked. Only about 500 people live there at the moment. Of course, the airport was closed. I guess a lot of work has to be done there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Bourne and Senator Loosley were having discussions with some of the village people, Ian Sinclair and I were led off by some of the troops because we wanted to have a look at the Panguna wharf and what was left of the boating facilities. Stephen Loosley said he will never forget the Arawa hospital. I do not think I will ever forget my feelings&mdash;I am sure Ian Sinclair feels the same&mdash;when driving around the old wharf area and looking at the destruction that had been caused there. It was almost like a moonscape. The feeling I had was similar to the feeling I had when I walked into the Dachau concentration camp some years ago. We found out afterwards that the reason I had this dread and horror was that it was the killing fields of the revolution; 100 bodies were supposed to have been secreted under the wharf. We were quite glad to get out of that area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most of the recommendations are self-explanatory. Senator Loosley and the foreign minister have already commented on most of our recommendations. This week was the commemoration of D-day. Something that lives in my mind is the day we arrived at Buka Island and had to transfer to Sohano Island for our accommodation. We went across by what was rather like a landing craft, only a much smaller version. I suppose that was our D-day&mdash;landing on Sohano Island, where our accommodation was for the two days. The thing I remember about Sohano Island was that the only hospital in Bougainville was located there. Conditions at that hospital were nothing short of horrific. There were no doctors on Bougainville at all. They had all left for varying reasons. A lot of them left because they were not getting paid enough money; some had left because they had been shot at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The hospital highlighted one of the problems that is going to have to be faced by those people who are trying to rehabilitate and restore Bougainville. A figure of between 200,000 and 500,000 kina was supposed to have been spent on upgrading the hospital. For the amount of money that was supposed to have been spent, all we could see was a little annex that had been built to provide an operating theatre. I guess that could be built here for not more than about $4,000 or $5,000. The hospital was as clean as it could possibly be made, but it was certainly overcrowded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the remnants of some of the resistance troops who had been shot three weeks beforehand in the south of Bougainville, where I think 14 people were killed and 20-odd were wounded. Most of them were suffering from horrific wounds and most of them were in traction because their wounds were leg wounds. The traction was usually a bit of rope with a rock on the end of it. They were on open verandas and the overflow was in army tents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we moved on to the other parts of the hospital, we found that in some of the very crowded wards there were people with different diseases lumped together&mdash;pregnant women and people suffering from tuberculosis, leprosy and malaria&mdash;with hardly enough room to move between the beds. I suppose they could be called beds; they looked more like desktops to me. When Ian Sinclair and I were walking back to our accommodation in the semi-darkness, we found a repository for hospital waste&mdash;the waste had just been thrown against a tree. So there is obviously plenty of scope for assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NGOs are doing a fine job with what they have. I was very impressed by a determined young coordinator for the Red Cross, Pauline Onsa. She displayed remarkable leadership under very trying conditions. She made it clear to us that getting supplies was very difficult. When they did get them, most of them were out of date. There is a huge task in front of those people who are going to try to return some sort of normalcy to Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the evidence we had from Ruby Mirenka, I believe the situation on the other side, the BRA side, cannot be much better. In fact, we suspect that it is much worse. She went on to list some of the casualties, and they appear in the report. Some 525 people died in those areas between 1990 and 1993. I do not think we have any doubt about that at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to comment on our security. Lieutenant-Colonel Gary Young needs to be congratulated for doing a fine job under very difficult circumstances. I think he was very pleased to see the back of us. We took note of what we were supposed to do, but we could never tell what was around the corner. In fact, we did get a couple of scares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the appendix to the report, there are copies of speeches made by influential chairmen of different authorities. Mr Naona Taniung, the Chairman of the Central Bougainville Interim Authority, certainly made it known where Australia should be when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the Bougainville crisis which has touched our hearts and souls dearly, must not be isolated from Australia. Your country helped to create this crisis. You were, and continue to be part and parcel of the Bougainville crisis one way or another.</PARA>
<PARA>All members of the delegation had that rammed home to them wherever we went. In fact, speeches made by other dignitaries, such as Clement Dana from the North East Interim Commission, mentioned Australia's role and what they expected us to do. Nick Peniai made an excellent speech in the Tonu area, down south. He concluded by being very critical of those people who are causing problems within Australia by spreading rumours and whatever. At the end of the day, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tell them that if they are undecided as to what good they can do, JUST LEAVE US IN PEACE.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think I will ever forget that. Thomas Anis, the Chairman of the Buka Interim Authority, brought up the proverbial problem of the mine. We do not see that the mine has anything to do with the Bougainville crisis at the moment. If it ever happens to open at some time down the track, it may be a problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I would like to thank all those members of the delegation for their support and friendship during the visit, particularly Margaret Swieringa, who did such a fine job helping to put this report together. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, it is not very often that we get the opportunity to do something constructive in this place, but I feel very proud that I have had the opportunity to do so. I hope that in some way we may have helped to push the Bougainville crisis along to a peaceful solution. </PARA>

Absolutely no military solution is possible, and all sides have to agree to that.

We therefore have to take much of the responsibility for finding a solution. I believe we are doing that now. The visit was part of that; the report is part of that; and what the foreign minister has said in response to the report is part of that. We have to be very careful not to be seen as big brother. We have to be very careful not to take such a strong line that we are telling people what to do. We have to suggest solutions and hope that we can help to implement them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that we did not go to any BRA areas when we went to Bougainville, and we regret that. We tried to go to BRA areas but were unable to do so. We did not speak to any Bougainvilleans who are currently active in the BRA but we did speak to a few who have been active and who are still somewhat sympathetic. No matter whom we spoke to, to a person they just wanted to get back to normal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been some very positive and significant actions taken in PNG since our visit. We congratulate the PNG government, the BRA and everyone concerned on those moves. Suggestions of a multinational force from Fiji, Vanuatu and Tonga are excellent. I hope we can facilitate that, possibly through funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The promise to establish a human rights commission is excellent. We look forward to seeing that. I hope we can get frequent updates on how quickly that is being established. I hope we will be able to send representatives of our Human Rights and Equal Opportunities Commission to help with that establishment and I believe that Senator Gareth Evans is doing something in relation to that. Senator Evans also made an excellent point about establishing a police complaints unit in the North Solomons province of Bougainville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The talks between the PNG government and the BRA are a very good first step in confidence building measures, and I am very pleased to see that they have happened. As I said before, the conciliatory comments coming from the PNG government and the BRA make us think that we have provided a catalyst and that neither side is now being very hardline. They are both taking the conciliatory line and are prepared to talk with each other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our recommendations are self-evident and we stand by every single one of them. Recommendations 6.12 and 6.13 mention the defence forces, and I clarify them in case there is any confusion. We are saying that defence forces on the island at the moment should allocate priority to engineering services, health, transport and infrastructure. We should be able to use the defence cooperation funds we are currently spending in PNG in those areas. We think that they are the priority areas. Infrastructure has to be restored; transport has to be restored; health, which is the most important thing, has to be restored; and engineering services have to be restored. We are not saying, `Send more troops.' We want to see the troops that are already there doing things to help with the infrastructure. We want to see them doing things to help with what is happening on the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confidence building measures, such as informal talks between the PNG government and the BRA, are an excellent first step, and agreement on a chair and on the agenda for the talks can also help substantially in building up confidence in the process and its eventual success. We hope that also happens very soon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some points have already been agreed in the Endeavour Accord and the Honiara Accord. Four of those points were agreed in both accords. I hope that they can form the basis of the next agreement and that it will be one that will stick. The four points already agreed are: that the safety of all personnel on the island during any peace accord is guaranteed; that the return of services&mdash;health, education, communications and infrastructure&mdash;is most important and urgent; and that the long-term political future of Bougainville must be addressed but&mdash;as both accords said&mdash;not now. That point is still equally important&mdash;that it must be addressed, but not now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once we have a peace&mdash;we sincerely hope that we will have it very soon&mdash;there needs to be an ongoing effort to maintain it. Probably the most substantial way that can be achieved is by the PNG government looking very seriously at provincial governments and the autonomy it allows the provinces. I recommend going back to the structure put in place when PNG was set up in the 70s. That original structure provided for provisional governments, and at the time the push for provincial government was led by Bougainville. The structure allowed for provincial governments at different levels. If one province was not as advanced as another, it did not have a government that could do as much. I think that provincial governments are important and that having some autonomy within Bougainville with a provincial government is the way to go to maintain a peace once it is achieved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to mention Sir Paul Lapun, whom Senator Calvert and Senator Loosley mentioned earlier. He is a very impressive person. He was very strongly involved in the government of Papua New Guinea during the time that it was being set up and afterwards. He spoke to us and what he said was very impressive. He did not take either side, pointing out the faults and the good points on both sides. He suggested that a peace was possible. He felt that it was a matter of getting away from the hardline and coming towards the middle. He made some very good recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After we returned we heard that he had been attacked because of the amazing rumour mill that operates on Bougainville. His house had been burnt, he had been physically attacked, and his family&mdash;I was going to say that they were on the street, but there are no streets&mdash;had to leave their home and were in one of the refugee centres. That is a matter of enormous regret and it does not help anyone's reputation on Bougainville. It is something we all find quite appalling and it should never have happened. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to extend my thanks to the Bougainvilleans. The thing I will remember is the extraordinary openness and friendliness of all the Bougainvilleans with whom we came in contact. They are a most charming people. When we were welcomed&mdash;we were welcomed everywhere&mdash;it was not just a performance; we were made to feel part of the community. That was very instructive to us and we felt that we had more responsibility to the community because we were part of it. I felt very strongly about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to thank the PNG government, especially Prime Minister Wingti and the foreign minister, Sir Julius Chan. They both took an enormous interest in what we were doing. It could not have been easy having us just appear, going to Bougainville and doing something that they were not really sure would work.

Given the perseverance of armed forces over five years of fighting, we can expect fighting to continue if the concerns of people are not met in peaceful forums.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have several concerns, however: one of them being the fact that the delegation did not get to meet with the current representatives of the Bougainville Revolutionary Army. At least the delegation's report recognises this as a problem, but it does not help place confidence in the process suggested when one of the major parties to the conflict could not be consulted. The implication of 1.6 on page 2 is that the delegation and others were aware beforehand that it would be reporting to the Papua New Guinea minister for foreign affairs and trade and the Papua New Guinea government. I hope this was not a signal to the BRA that the delegation was clearly identifying with one side of this tragic conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendation on tying aid to projects specifically in Bougainville is a good way to avoid misdirection of funds, but we are puzzled at why there should be aid through the defence cooperation program. That program is purely a military allocation of funds, equipment and training; and Australia needs to recognise that its military aid program has only served to escalate the conflict.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We would certainly like to see a peace dividend where humanitarian aid would be available from a decrease in military aid, but we do not see the Australian government being best placed to provide humanitarian aid through a military program. It is a program administered by the Defence Department whose members are probably neither skilled nor able to provide humanitarian aid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A much more preferable option would be a peace dividend where humanitarian aid would be available from a decrease in military aid, and provided to non-government organisations which have had experience in these matters. The delegation has recommended that aid programs should be carried out by Papua New Guinea civilian agencies rather than the Papua New Guinea defence force. Why cannot this be similar for Australia?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the then Treasurer, Paul Keating, paid $431,100 on 15 May 1991 for his half ownership of a piggery group, its first ever accounts since its formation in 1988 were being prepared. They were for the year to 30 June 1990; they were unaudited and signed allegedly on 20 May 1991. They were not only grossly false with a hugely overstated view of the group's financial strength but also not submitted to the Australian Securities Commission until 10 July 1992, more than two years after the balance date. Even then, it was only as a result of an Australian Securities Commission query about the group's failure to provide the annual returns required by law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The accounts falsely showed that, over the first two financial years of the group's existence to 30 June 1990, the three companies in the piggery group had together earned $1.3 million. The truth was that instead the group had suffered substantial losses, as indeed it has in every year of its existence. To arrive at this crooked profits figure, the company's directors&mdash;through Mr Achilles Constantinidis who signed it and submitted it to the Securities Commission&mdash;simply failed to deduct from its earnings the multimillion dollar interest bill on the group's huge borrowings. These omitted interest costs totalled almost $4 million over these first two years although this was not shown anywhere in the accounts that were available in May 1991. Presumably, Mr Paul Keating relied on these for his information. Maybe the purpose was to show how the group would perform if equity capital replaced the borrowings that had always totally funded the group. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This certainly highlighted the devastating impact of Treasurer Keating's high interest rate policy. The profit claim of $470,824 for 1989 for the three piggery companies in the group was before that year's interest bill of $2 million, as indicated by a subsequent parent company audit of accounts. The profit in 1990 of $842,999 totally ignored a $1.8 million interest bill. So the real results were a loss of $1.5 million in 1989 and $1 million in 1990. But even this phoney trading profit had been contrived by running down the group's livestock holdings from $2.7 million opening balance in 1989 to only $1.9 million closing balance in 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final proof that the group has never made a profit comes from one simple statistic. After five years of its existence, not one member company of the Prime Minister's former piggery group has ever paid one cent of company tax. With Mr Keating's taxation record, he no doubt would have insisted that his company paid whatever taxes were due and on time. How did the company cope with these huge losses without appearing to go broke? They simply fiddled the book entries by changing a $4.5 million debt improperly into shareholders' equity and revaluing their piggery buildings by $4 million upwards, without the benefit of a certificate from a licensed valuer and in the face of the reality of their deterioration over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So by June 1990, the group as a whole including its disastrous refrigeration subsidiaries&mdash;which Mr Constantinidis appears to have bought into the group from the wreckage of the Scoufis's family's failed Olympia refrigeration group&mdash;had already lost about $3 million after accounting for intra-group write-offs. On the book value shown at that time, its liabilities considerably exceeded its assets. It was technically bankrupt. These accounts were not audited but were prepared by the respectable Sydney accounting firm of KPMG Peat Marwick on 20 May 1991. These accounts, the only ones apparently available to the Danish joint venture prospective partners at that time, appear to have done their dishonest job. Despite the KPMG Peat Marwick disclaimer as to accuracy, the Danpork director, Rene Madelaire, felt sufficiently confident about these accounts&mdash;of a company half owned by Mr Keating, the former Treasurer and likely next Prime Minister&mdash;to assert in August 1991 to the sceptical Danish pig farmer members of the cooperatives backing the Danpork project and the financial institutions putting up 80 per cent of the cash that their joint venture partner in Australia, the Brown and Hatton group, was `a financially strong' meat wholesaler and pig producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was false. They are not, and have never been, financially strong, as even the unsatisfactory audited accounts revealed. In fact, the Commonwealth Bank had become sufficiently concerned in 1989 to require the group to dispose of three Tamworth piggeries and some city properties to reduce its debt. But incredibly this bank&mdash;which was, in his own terms, `run' by the Treasurer, Mr Keating&mdash;had not at any stage required the group to meet its obligation under its mortgage documents relating to its then debt of almost $20 million to provide audited annual accounts to the bank. The fact is that this piggery group had no auditor until one was eventually appointed to the group on 3 December 1992 at the request of the Securities Commission in response to my November 1992 letter of complaint that followed six months of my demands in parliament that the group lodge with the ASC the audited accounts required by law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Prime Minister of Australia was either a conscious or a dumb, willing or unwitting, participant in a scheme aimed apparently at deceiving Danish investors. This deception was a key element in getting the Danes into bed with Brown and Hatton. Even with this phoney `financially strong' tag, a New South Wales government official warned in September 1991, just a month after Mr Madelaire said it, in an internal memo that `the Danish pig farmers who make up the ownership behind Danpork continue to be suspicious of the whole project.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it was not only the farmers who had serious misgivings. Austrade's European director, Mr D. Ward, greeted the final signing of the joint venture deal in April 1992, when Paul Keating was Prime Minister, with a memo noting that Austrade's Dr Walter Roso deserved praise for the `numerous discussions with financial institutions to keep this project on the rails when it was going badly off-track'. I might add that I raised this question of Austrade's deep involvement with this matter at the Senate estimates committee, and I look forward to hearing the response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for financial support for the project by Danish financial institutions, particularly pension funds, who are providing about 80 per cent of the finance for the Danpork venture, grew even more pressing after October 1991 when Danpork's director, Mr Madelaire, got `a poor reception from financial markets in Sydney re debt financing proposals' for the project. Locals, uninfluenced by Mr Paul Keating's presence, who could read a balance sheet, would have regarded the full 1990 accounts as a total joke. If by then there were any draft 1991 figures around&mdash;they were not filed with the ASC, by the way, until December of the following year or well after the venture was locked in&mdash;they would have shown an unaudited loss for the group of $1.5 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This loss was allegedly, and wrongly, offset by a $1.5 million profit planned for the associated borrowing vehicle, Rincraft Pty Ltd. But this company is not consolidated into the group and was not subject to audit, as it is owned directly by Euphron Pty Ltd and not through the Brown and Hatton group, which, as public companies until May 1991, were required by law to provide audited accounts for those years when they had public status. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd audited accounts finally did emerge, they showed that, in each of the three financial years of the parent company's life to June 1991, it had suffered losses of $1.36 million, $3.15 million and $2.84 million. The refrigeration companies had amassed losses of about $2.7 million, subject to some intercompany balances. So five of the seven companies of the Brown and Hatton Group had their accounts qualified by the auditor that their liabilities exceeded their assets and they could only continue in business with the support of their bankers and their ultimate owners. And&mdash;which bank?&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank had an equitable mortgage over the group, while the ultimate owners were Messrs Keating and Constantinidis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But while Mr Constantinidis signed personal guarantees to the bank, along with his fellow group director, Mr Peter Christopher, as reported in the group's 1991 accounts, Mr Keating, as a half owner, was not required to do so. In any event, because he was not a director, he had no legal obligation, let alone any capacity or desire, to stand behind his collapsing piggery empire, unless he participated in decisions relating to the losses, which may have been the case as he had what appears to be a nominee on the board. But, on the face of it, the ultimate owners, Messrs Keating and Constantinidis, had no capacity to support the group in the event of the withdrawal of the bank&mdash;the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why Mr Keating's bank should leave itself so exposed to loans to Mr Keating's companies is a matter of major concern. The only apparently bright stars in the Brown and Hatton firmament were two profitable subsidiaries, Brown and Hatton Rural, which ran the piggeries, and Brown and Hatton Wholesale, which sold the pigs. Between them they had amassed almost $4 million in so-called profits by June 1991, according to the audited accounts eventually filed&mdash;as a result of my pressure&mdash;with the Australian Securities Commission. But these accounts give no indication of the real profitability of the piggeries because no payments whatsoever were made to Brown and Hatton Group Pty Ltd for the use of the piggery land and buildings which it owns. So the false impression was created that the actual pig farming operation was successful. It was not and never has been. This became evident when the group audited accounts were eventually filed&mdash;with the ASC issuing penalty notices for late lodgment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a serious impropriety emerging from companies half owned by the Prime Minister of Australia, with up to $30 million in stated assets and liabilities, and sales of more than $20 million a year&mdash;$13 million in pigs and $7 million in refrigeration&mdash;and holding themselves out to foreign investors to be financially strong, being fined for not filing annual returns and ultimately submitting returns which were palpably false, in breach of the Corporations Law and requiring major corrections. Yet this prime ministerial half owner apparently did nothing to correct the plethora of inadequate and illegal returns by his companies, even after their inadequacy and, in many instances, falsity was clearly demonstrated by me in this parliament. The response by the Prime Minister and his ministers was always that I was indulging in unsubstantiated muckraking whenever yet another set of Keating piggery accounts was revealed to be false. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was only after I wrote to the Australian Securities Commission in November 1992, requesting that it act on my revelations in the Senate&mdash;incredibly, the Securities Commission had done nothing on its own initiative to pursue these matters that I had been raising since June 1992&mdash;that the Prime Minister's companies were forced by the Securities Commission to comply with the Corporations Law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The impropriety of this failure to take any action to correct false returns, which had been demonstrated to him in parliament to be false, is inexcusable. I believe the Prime Minister should explain why his companies waited several months after their fraudulent behaviour was exposed before the accounts were corrected on the instructions of the Securities Commission. This may be in character, because we would all know that the Prime Minister did not believe that laws relating to the prompt and timely provision of tax returns should be followed. The question of living away from home allowance regulations applying to him apparently was not considered either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a half owner, let alone a Prime Minister, he had at least a moral obligation to ensure his companies abided by the law. His apparent indifference to whether they did so or not raises serious questions. It is now clear just why Mr Keating's companies were breaking the Corporations Law: to have abided by it would have exposed the group to being in deep financial trouble at a time when the joint venture deal with the Danes was subject to very delicate negotiations and was going `badly off track' and when Australian financial institutions would not have a bar of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For seven months of this time Mr Keating was on the back bench heavily involved in detailed negotiations over the deal. Whether his heavy involvement included knowledge of the phoney nature of these accounts and the reason his companies were breaching the Corporations Law, is a question that Mr Keating must now answer. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

Against this background, I ask: what is the government doing to develop further our trade and investment relationships with these two countries?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Colston for his question, which is very important because, when taken together, Japan and Korea account for nearly one-third of Australia's exports. So although there are people who still like to live closeted in the past, the future, very importantly, lies in markets such as that. Up until now commodities have dominated our exports to those two markets, and they will continue to do so;  but, as implied in Senator Colston's question, there is room for significant optimism about the potential for sales of competitive manufactures and services to these markets, which is very important for jobs in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The potential arises because of changes taking place in Australia making us more efficient and effective exporters, and changes taking place in those countries that change the import environment. Honourable senators would be aware of the economic reforms already under way in both Japan and Korea. Furthermore, Prime Minister Hata has indicated that a major package of reforms is expected to be announced in Japan in the next few weeks, and in Korea the Kim Yun Sung government has introduced a package of economic measures dealing with micro-economic reform, taxation, financial markets and foreign investment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will be visiting Korea and Japan next month, and on those occasions I will, on behalf of Australian business and industry, be registering our support for the reform in both those countries, highlighting our positive economic performance and prospects, including as a competitive and reliable supplier, not just of bulk commodities, which we are, but of high technology goods and high value services as well; that is, changing their perception of us and promoting trade and investment opportunities for Australian firms in both Japan and Korea.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some particular issues which we will need to raise about post-Uruguay Round access; for example, beef, dairy, and horticulture particularly in Korea, and emphasising the importance we place on assurances from the Japanese government that bilateral trade difficulties with the US will not impair our motor vehicle components exports to Japan, which are currently valued at $200 million. I think that is underestimated by most Australians; they do not appreciate its significance. We want to change their image of us so they realise we are more than a sunburnt country, and that we can export more than commodities and tourist products, invaluable as those are.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also want to change the perception in some quarters in the Australian business community that selling manufactures or services to Japan and Korea is too difficult. We are already doing well, although there is a potential to do much more. In 1993, exports of Australian elaborately transformed manufactures to Korea amounted to $462 million&mdash;up 61 per cent on 1992. There is recent evidence of successful exports in this area to Japan, an example being the sale of a high speed aluminium ferry valued at $11 million&mdash;Australia is becoming a world leader in that field, as many honourable senators would know.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also identified growing opportunities for Australian business in both Korea and Japan in important manufacturing and service sectors, and the opportunity to participate in Japan's new import facilitation or foreign access zones, particularly in Osaka. Austrade estimates that combined export sales of Australian participants in that centre will reach $40 million in the first year of operation. Clearly there is potential for much more.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said yesterday&mdash;and I do not know what figures Senator Lees has, but I am quite sure they are the figures I referred to yesterday concluding at the year to May 1993&mdash;the advice I had been given was that the ABS more recent figures showed that the loss of women's earnings is not as we could conclude from those figures. That is the advice I was given and I have told the Senate that once that detailed analysis is provided to me I will bring it into the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite true that if women's earnings are not increasing and keeping pace with what they were earning before, or compared with men, then quite clearly their opportunity for superannuation will not be as good as that for people with a higher income. There is no doubt about that. It is a concern that women have access to superannuation. As I said yesterday, one of the great improvements for women has been the extension of superannuation to so many more women under the changes introduced by this government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what is also important&mdash;and this picks up the point that Senator Lees raises about pension age&mdash;is the very significant increase in labour force participation by women, particularly those between the ages of 45 and 55, women who show no indication of wanting to retire from the work force once they get to be 55. They know that their superannuation will be vastly increased and far better for them by five more years in the work force&mdash;between 60 and 65&mdash;than if they should retire at 60.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned to find the balance between that increasing representation of women in the work force and the clear indication that some women either are not able to find work when they are 60 or approaching 60, or prefer to stay on the other payments or benefits they have had to that point. That is why the government is phasing in the age pension for women over such a long time, over a lead time of 20 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no intention by government to back away from that long lead-in time because I believe the 20-year phase in is the balance between that increased participation of women in the work force and the reasonable and realistic expectations of women.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I stress that these are the most recent figures. While I thank Senator Crowley for her answer, I stress that the pension is an option. We are not talking about compulsory retirement for women at 60. Obviously, those who wish to work to 65 will still have the ability to do so, but I believe that government is expecting only about 10 per cent of women in that age group to continue to age 65. I ask again: why is the minister going to penalise something like 90 per cent of the women aged between 60 and 65, as the government phases in this pension increase, and force them to continue on a range of other support services and supplementary benefits, rather than have the security of the pension?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lees is drawing conclusions about that 10 per cent figure and what would happen to women aged between 60 and 65. There is a 20-year lead time before the pension age for women is fully out to 65. We have to realise that at the moment the women who are coming up to 60 will have to wait in the first case only six months extra before they are eligible for the pension. It is a matter of judgment about the balance. In the face of that increased labour force participation rate, the government has moved to a very long phase-in time. I remind senators opposite that it is double the time they proposed; they were going to do it in 10 years. This government takes account of that and is doing it over 20 years. As I say, I believe in getting the balance right. As Senator Lees also just commented, the government recognises the need for some type of security or on-going payment for women who are not able to have work, or choose not to&mdash;and that will continue.</PARA></TALK.START>

Can the minister inform the Senate of progress with the MFP's first stage urban development? What will be the economic significance of the development?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Foreman for his question. This morning in Adelaide Mr Ross Kennan, the MFP chief executive, made an announcement on the commencement of the development process for the project's Adelaide core site. The MFP Development Corporation has made a call for registrations of interest from Australian international firms to develop commercially the first stage of the core site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Extensive international advertising will offer developers the opportunity to register interest before 22 July this year. As a result, MFP Australia will choose a partner to develop the first stage of its urban development to high standards of innovation. The MFP will then negotiate heads of agreement and conduct a joint design exercise with the preferred candidate for consideration by the end of this year. If a satisfactory agreement is reached to approve the project, contractual negotiations and detailed design work will follow immediately, and construction will start in the second half of next year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful development consortium will have to demonstrate a history of world's best practice in urban design and, moreover, a capacity to set new benchmarks in urban planning. The theme of the project will be to show the successful coexistence of commercial, residential and community facilities. The economic benefits will be quite substantial. A 500-hectare site is expected to house up to 12,000 people in 5,000 dwellings. The total cost of the development, which will be private sector driven, will be around $1 billion over the coming 10 to 12 years.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that since the appointment of the chief executive of the MFP, Mr Kennan, in May of last year and the appointment of the development corporation board early in 1993, it has been proved that the MFP project does have strength to proceed. I also have to say that I accept the fact that there has been some cynicism in some quarters, but it is pleasing to note that the former South Australian Liberal Party opposition, now the government, has accepted the Australian government's view that the MFP should be seen as a national and international project. We have reached agreement in accordance with those themes. Therefore, the project is now proceeding and the people of South Australia and the rest of Australia, and the international interests in MFP, will see its construction starting over the next 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Australian government, I would like to express special appreciation to Mr Kennan, the chief executive; Mr Alex Morokoff; the members of the development board; and the staff of the corporation for the work that they have done in the last 18 months.</PARA>

I have not had time to check all the details, and I am investigating the background to them. In response to Senator Margetts's question, I can provide at this stage the following information. I think everybody would be aware that the Australian government does not have any specific mechanisms in place to deal with forced labour or child labour as it relates to imports into Australia, whether with particular regard to Thailand or any other country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do, however, have a regular dialogue with Thailand on human rights issues. We are assisting the Thais to address the problem themselves, specifically in their effort to establish a human rights commission which in part would address these issues. The Thai government is currently finalising draft legislation for the establishment of a national human rights commission. Under the draft legislation the commission would have the authority to investigate allegations of human rights abuses, and it would also be responsible for promoting human rights in Thailand and educating people about their rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal Human Rights Commissioner, Brian Burdekin, visited Thailand in March at the invitation of the Thais and held discussions with officials from the Thai office of the attorney-general on the work of the Australian Human Rights Commission and the legislative framework within which it operates. The Chuan government recognises the seriousness of the issue and, in September last year, established a new ministry of labour to better address problems of labour conditions and welfare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Thailand is concerned that trade and labour standards will be used as a trade barrier against its exports, it has undertaken to work with other countries to combat the worst excesses of labour exploitation. It sees the ILO and UNICEF as having the main international carriage of these issues. Australian unions are currently involved in a tripartite government-union-business program to enhance Thailand's labour standards. The government has been a strong supporter of the work of the Thai special rapporteur on the sale of children, including the examination of the problem of child labour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the second question, I am advised that the 81st session of the International Labour Conference which is being held in Geneva from 7-24 June 1994 will be considering a report by the ILO committee of experts on the application of conventions and recommendations. That report addresses the issue of child labour in the context of the examination of reports on the application of ILO convention No. 29, forced labour, of 1930. The committee commented on the direct contacts mission which, at the request of the government of Thailand, visited that country in September last year. The Australian government delegate to the conference is expected to make a statement in support of the report of the committee of experts.</PARA>

Australia's view is that the ILO has a central role in strengthening labour standards, and the role the WTO might play in any link between trade and labour standards needs careful consideration in the light of developments internationally, and in particular, in the light of attempts to make the ILO more effective in this area.</PARA>

Because of our very effective representation internationally, Australia's exports to Indonesia have grown by an average of 26 per cent each year over the last five years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell indicated to me a day or so ago that he wanted to raise this matter and I appreciate that forewarning. I point out that, as a matter relating to the Trade Practices Commission, it is a matter for the Assistant Treasurer, Mr Gear, and I will refer the question to him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I want to say that, as a member some years ago of the Senate legal and constitutional affairs committee that made recommendations to this parliament about amending the Trade Practices Act, I was one of those who supported the provision about unconscionable conduct going into that act, particularly because I believed, as did the majority of members on that committee, that it would assist small business in the balance of commercial power to have a protection through the courts or through the Trade Practices Commission.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a power that should be there. It is a power, as I understand it, that has yet to be tested in the Trade Practices Commission. I have had some discussions informally with the Trade Practices Commissioner about whether it is possible for that power to be tested in an appropriate case for the benefit of small business. One of the problems many small businesses have is that they do not have the economic resources to pay for a major challenge in a civil case. That is a disadvantage to them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are very important issues here. I would also say to Senator Boswell that the case he raises is very germane to the unconscionable conduct provision. To say whether it is a provision that can be used in this case, I will wait for advice from the Assistant Treasurer and the Trade Practices Commission. But there is no doubt that if we want a healthy and viable small business community in this country&mdash;a community that has already been recognised as providing the biggest job growth and the biggest input into economic growth in this country&mdash;it will have to operate in an economic environment where those with consolidated economic power are not able to inhibit its growth by using that consolidated economic power.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that is actually broader than a partisan issue of politics. It is an issue for the parliament to debate and to consider the balance between small business, big business and the economic environment in which all business operates. It is something that has been raised with me by members of the Small Business Forum and the many small businesses affected in this general area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I say to Senator Boswell&mdash;even though he is on the opposition side of the chamber&mdash;that I was somewhat amazed that he was not made shadow minister for small business. In my period in the job he has been the only member of the opposition who has consistently asked me questions about small business. I do not want to give him the kiss of death, but I do appreciate the fact that he has consistently and genuinely raised small business issues, and I hope it continues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories. I remind the minister that the national forest policy includes a statement that forest management agencies will avoid activities that may significantly affect areas of old growth forest or wilderness until assessments of conservation values have taken place. I ask: does the minister agree that this statement should be interpreted as a moratorium on logging of old growth forests and wilderness until assessments have taken place? Will the minister nominate the Southern Forests, the forests of the Great Western Tiers and the Tarkine for inclusion in the Tasmanian wilderness World Heritage area? Finally, will the minister, unlike the previous minister, ensure that his department carries out a comprehensive assessment of areas to be excluded from this year's woodchip licence renewals?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the NFPS is Commonwealth government policy. The Commonwealth is committed to achieving the conservation objectives of the NFPS throughout Australia. I interpret the so-called moratorium clause of the NFPS literally; that is, that logging and other high impact activities should be excluded from those areas of old growth forest and wilderness which are likely to have high conservation value until detailed assessments of their conservation values have been undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the terms of the intergovernmental agreement on the environment, all proposals for World Heritage nomination are to be referred by the Commonwealth to the relevant state government for comment prior to their being progressed by the Commonwealth government. Consistent with this arrangement, the Commonwealth has referred the World Heritage nomination proposal covering the Tarkine to the Tasmanian government for comment. The Commonwealth has also referred the nomination proposals covering parts of western Tasmania, including the Great Western Tiers, to the Tasmanian government. In relation to those matters, I have asked the Tasmanian government for a response by the end of this month.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will not endorse the Tasmanian forest and forest industries strategy until it takes account of Commonwealth obligations to forests, including the protection of endangered species and National Estate values, World Heritage values, biodiversity issues, and also Aboriginal cultural heritage values. Assessments would also need to cover economic and social values and opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth has made it clear to the Tasmanian government that its preferred approach to dealing with forest issues in that state is through a comprehensive regional assessment process which covers all forests, and that is described in the national forest policy statement. Under the NFPS, any comprehensive regional assessment process is to be initiated by an invitation from a state government. The aim of the process is to produce an intergovernmental regional forest agreement which specifies forest management arrangements that meet the range of obligations for forests of both governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The agreement would balance increased certainty of access to resources for industry and the systematic and comprehensive protection of environmental and heritage values. The process could also provide a vehicle for the identification and interim protection of old growth forests and wilderness likely to have high conservation value, which would be consistent with the moratorium clause of the NFPS.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"> (Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is helpful, I think, to get a few things clear when we are talking about inequality of income, wealth, richness, poverty and so on in this country. The first thing is, repeating what I said yesterday, that there is absolutely nothing surprising about an increased spread in the distribution of gross earnings in the kind of economy we now have. This is a widespread international phenomenon in advanced economies such as Australia. That is what having a high wage, high technology, advanced economy is all about: the lowest income earners do not get poorer, their earnings grow too, but at a slower rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course there are some people who are outside the earning system who are unemployed&mdash;we are entirely familiar with that&mdash;and it is crucial for governments to play an active role in improving their wellbeing right across the spectrum, alleviating their relative poverty, which is a real phenomenon, and enhancing their skills so that they can stay in touch with a radically changing labour market and so benefit from higher paying jobs. That is exactly what our white paper is all about&mdash;removing that skill impediment and enabling these people, including the people of whom Senator Campbell speaks, to get back into the wage and labour force.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other significant problem in every attack that is made on the inequality performance of the country at the moment is an utter unwillingness to acknowledge the issue of data measurement. The problem with the sorts of measures of earnings distribution that we have seen from the ABS and elsewhere is that they do not have any proper regard for the redistributive effects of taxation, which are very significant in this country; they certainly do not have regard to non-cash support through Medicare, public housing, pharmaceutical benefits, pensioner concessions, non-cash support of that kind; and in most instances they do not have regard to the impact of cash income support other than through wages, salaries and dividends as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking those factors into account, it is just not true to say that there has been the kind of gap that Senator Campbell is talking about, in the sense that the poorest members of our society have actually been increasing quite dramatically and very obviously their share of national income during the 1980s. But any consideration of these sorts of issues should, in a properly balanced way, take into account what the opposition has to say on these particular issues. A lot of problems of credibility are faced by these issues being raised on the other side of the chamber.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Knowles this day, relating to women's earnings.</PARA>
<PARA>It is amazing that a minister can come into this place and not know the details of that `information' that she supposedly gave the Senate yesterday. The minister is now walking out of the chamber, refusing to even listen to this debate. The fact is that the minister yesterday gave information to this Senate that said there was not a widening of the gap between income that was paid to men and that paid to women. She said there were more recent statistics available and she would table them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are, 24 hours later, and she still has not got those statistics. The details are contained in later information in a document that I received today entitled `Average weekly earnings in Australia in February 1994'. If I was able to get access to this, why was the minister not able to get access to it? Why has she not tabled it already? It is the latest information that the Australian Bureau of Statistics has available, as of today. No more information will be available on the subject until 14 June. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am absolutely amazed that this minister, who trumpets the activity of this government in the way in which women are treated, and the equality that women are supposed to get under this government, is not aware and not absolutely damning of her government's policies that have seen the widening of the gap between the incomes of men and women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report from the ABS, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The distribution and composition of employee earnings and hours</EMPHASIS>, which was dated May 1993 but released only a couple of days ago, quite clearly shows that there are so many differences right across the spectrum of employment and occupations. Why is it that this minister will not address these problems within the ministry and the caucus, and actually get something done?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Campbell mentioned a little while ago the widening of the gap between the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. That is a known fact. No matter how much Senator Gareth Evans wants to filibuster and abuse senators on this side of the chamber&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have a new Black Rod up there in the Black Rod's seat. I would go so far as to say the Black Rod would certainly have far more information on this subject than the minister. We should get the Black Rod in here to answer her questions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point that Senator Evans has abused everyone on this side of the chamber, saying there is not a case to be put for the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. Not only is that substantiated by every piece of information that is coming out, and has come out for quite some time, but we are now getting more and more information substantiating the fact that women are going to be falling more and more into that poor getting poorer category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this minister doing about it? She is doing absolutely naught. The people of Australia need to know that the record of this government in terms of protecting the poor and protecting the interests of women is nothing short of appalling. It is doing absolutely nothing. The minister still does not have the statistics; and these latest statistics, across all employees' average weekly total earnings for the last quarter that is available&mdash;November last year to February this year&mdash;quite clearly show that men's earnings are double those of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the issues that have been raised by the Australian Democrats impinge on the reality of what is going to happen to women and their security as they get closer to retirement age. This government cannot continue to deny the reality of what is happening in Australia not only to the poorer end of the community but specifically targeted to women. I would be very interested to know whether the minister has any other statistics which she claims she can present here today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think something needs to be said on the record about this particular issue. There are two sets of data that bear upon the women's relative earnings question that I am familiar with. One is the data that Senator Knowles seems to be specifically referring to, and that is the average weekly earnings data released by the ABS in February 1994, just a few months ago, indicating that women's average weekly ordinary time earnings&mdash;that is excluding overtime&mdash;for full-time adult employees were 84 per cent of men's earnings in February 1994 compared with a ratio of 84.2 per cent in November 1991, immediately following the introduction of the enterprise bargaining principle. If those are the figures that Senator Knowles is referring to it is very difficult to argue that that decline has any significance whatsoever. Certainly, the available information should not be interpreted as any deterioration in the relative position of women workers during the period of enterprise bargaining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other material around is the ABS survey data released on 6 June 1994, just a couple of days ago, which does show an increase in the gap between male and female earnings but which data relates to the year to May 1993&mdash;as Senator Crowley was saying, that is over 12 months ago&mdash;and thus does not reflect any benefits at all that flow through from recent government initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The growth in wages between May 1992 and May 1993 does not indicate a trend. In fact, it is the reverse of what occurred between 1991 and 1992, the preceding year, when women's wages grew at 4.5 per cent while men's wages lagged with only two per cent growth over that period. There are a number of factors which explain the variability of wage increases, including the incidence of overtime payments which are predominantly associated with male dominated industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, when analysing this issue, it really is important to focus on the longer-term trends rather than the bumps and grinds that do occur from month to month or occasionally from year to year. The situation is that pay equity has shown significant improvements since the Labor government came to office in 1983, at which stage female average weekly ordinary time earnings represented just 79.7 per cent of male earnings. I do not think we need to spell out again the government's commitment to pay equity for women. That is enshrined in our Industrial Relations Reform Act, which included a range of safety net provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have the situation whereby there will be an annual report to the Minister for Industrial Relations monitoring enterprise bargaining, particularly in its impact on women's wages, and further provisions to ensure that lower paid workers, many of whom are of course women, do not fall behind. It is in that context that the government will be supporting the second and third safety net wage adjustments of $8 a week which have recently been announced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, there are other budgetary measures&mdash;for example, the one last year in the 1993-94 budget providing $3.5 million over four years for working women's centres in order to advise and assist women on pay and conditions issues.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So there is nothing to be in any way ashamed of, apologetic or defensive about so far as this government's record on this particular issue is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So far as the larger issue of inequality&mdash;or purported inequality&mdash;in Australia is concerned, I repeat that part of the problem in the opposition's response on this issue is the way in which those opposite jump over what are very crucial qualifications and aspects of this data that need to be understood. We cannot just gloss over the problem that exists of data measurement because measures of earnings distribution, which is the most familiar one that we see in this context, do not have, as I said in question time, any regard for the redistributive effects of taxation; they do not have any regard for non-cash support; and they do not very often have regard either for cash income support. When we factor these in the spread between the highest earners and the lowest earners narrows quite considerably. Certainly, it is the case that using broader measures the poorest members of our society did increase their share of national income during the 1980s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other crucial consideration in understanding these figures whenever they are being thrown about is to realise, as I said before, that gross earnings figures by themselves can in fact be quite misleading. What we do need to appreciate is that gross earnings spreads are opening up all round the developed, high-tech, advanced economies. Lowest earners are not getting poorer in that environment; their earnings are growing too but at a slower rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is necessary for government to take separate policy action to deal with the phenomenon of those who get left aside in this kind of industrial, new economic milieu. It is exactly to deal with that particular problem of people who might fall by the wayside&mdash;the people that John Hewson did not want to turn around and give a helping hand to because those opposite would get dragged back if they did&mdash;that we introduced the white paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to point out to the chamber and particularly to those who are listening on this broadcast day that Senator Knowles asked those questions of the Minister assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women (Senator Crowley). She is actually in the chamber at the moment. It is quite interesting to note that she was unable to answer the questions. In fact, she made a fool of herself during two question times when answering questions from both Senator Knowles and Senator Lees, if I remember correctly. The responsibility of answering the question has been given to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans, because clearly the government does not trust and has no confidence in its own minister to deliver answers which were effectively a technical description of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not Senator Evans's answer is right, the sad political point is that Mr Keating has installed Minister Crowley on his front bench and, clearly, in so many areas like health and women's affairs she is incapable of answering quite simple questions in question time. This has been graphically shown here today by Senator Evans having to answer the questions. Senator Crowley does not even have an excuse for not doing so. She does not have a meeting in her office or something else to go to. She is here, wandering and fluffing around, interjecting from the Black Rod's chair, and she cannot even answer the question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sad reality is that in Australia the rich, Labor's big business mates, are getting richer and the poor, the sort of people that people like Senator Murphy come in here to stick up for, are getting poorer. That is the truth. Amongst those people who are getting poorer are the women in Australia, who the Labor Party professes to stick up for. It wants to create equality between the sexes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cold, hard reality about how this government sees equality is the same as how the pigs in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Animal Farm</EMPHASIS> saw it. It is okay for Senator Crowley because she is on a ministerial salary. She is quite okay. She would have us believe that all women should be created equal and should also receive equal pay, but some women should be more equal than others. Women who are close friends of Paul Keating will of course be more equal than all others in Australia. That is the sad reality. The ultimate reality is that Mr Keating's chosen woman minister to represent the interests of women cannot even convince the Senate of the quality of her government's own programs. She has to get Senator Evans to do it for her. </PARA>

In the process, the attempt has led to the corruption of police and prison warders, as well as top legal and political figures. Speaking of politicians: a recent poll of federal politicians showed that 52 per cent of senators and members were in favour of the decriminalisation of marijuana, while only 44 per cent were not. When asked whether the politician would be prepared to vote in favour of legislation in line with his or her personal views if there were a conscience vote, 71 per cent said yes, and only 20 per cent said no. Let us have a conscience vote on this issue, for it is indeed a conscience matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only does the illicit trade in drugs support directly an enormous criminal element, it also turns otherwise law-abiding citizens who use drugs for personal use into criminals. Much of the theft of electrical and electronic items from homes is carried out in support of a drug habit, and imprisoning carries its own risk. Prisons are not free of drugs. Warders in some prisons have become drug runners. Prisoners may emerge from prison having run up debts, simply from buying drugs to feed their drug habit. On discharge, they are immediately involved in more theft to repay these debts. Injectable drugs are also available in prison, thus exposing inmates to the risk of AIDS, hepatitis and other transmittable infections. Indeed, the first case of drug-induced AIDS in a drug-using inmate of a prison has recently occurred in New South Wales. Imprisonment does not solve the problem of drug taking; it compounds it with other problems as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some evidence, and it is growing, that drug addiction may be the outward expression of a genetic predisposition. Again, if this is the case, it is morally wrong to treat these people as criminals and not as people needing medical help. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possession of a criminal record by those who have been caught is also a severe penalty for personal users. The survey I have referred to found that 34 per cent of parliamentarians had used cannabis before entering the parliament and that seven per cent had used other illegal drugs. These members and senators know that they are only in this place because they did not get caught. If they contemplate for a moment the consequences for them had the arbitrariness of arrest thrown them into prison, they would have to vote for this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA resolution is a mild one&mdash;indeed, one could say that it is very timid&mdash;but it is a step in the right direction. It urges us to minimise the social harm arising from the use and possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use, and that is what this motion is calling on senators to support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution emphasises the harm that can arise from the use of cannabis and urges more emphasis to be placed on education programs to reduce its use; it urges that more work be done on the pharmacology and toxicology of cannabis; and it stresses the health consequences of imprisonment and asks for a redirection away from criminal sanctions towards treatment and rehabilitation. I therefore most strongly urge the Senate to support this motion. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The failure of the present treatment of cannabis users by imprisonment, the danger to both the users and to society of this way of dealing with this problem, and the lack of action in relation to the following resolution of the 1994 National Conference of the AMA. . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not dispute the negative effects of imprisonment as a treatment for cannabis&mdash;if it is only for cannabis&mdash;and I think that there is more agreement than dispute about the dangers to users and to society but I cannot agree with the reference to `lack of action' in relation to the AMA resolution, which is all of 10 days old. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting that aside, I would like to run through some of the issues that are raised by this debate because there are two or three serious matters for consideration that get wheeled in and out of the debate to make a point here and lose a point somewhere else. The first is that of the health impact of cannabis. The jury is still out on that one but there is a growing body of fact about cannabis and nowadays few people would say that it is a totally safe drug that does a little bit of mind altering but has little other consequence. That is an improvement on where the debate has been. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is now no doubt that people should be properly concerned about the impact of cannabis taken regularly in significant amounts. Whether that would also be the assessment of people who are casual or intermittent users is a different question. What worries me is the emerging evidence of the earlier onset of lung cancers from smoking cannabis. We have evidence emerging of permanent memory loss after some years of use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the greatest concern is the impact on car drivers. Perhaps we ought to be looking at ways of testing for drugs as well as breathalyser tests for alcohol use for people in possession of cars. We have some tests for these drugs, as the drugs in sport inquiry found out. Senator Crichton-Browne had an interest in the drugs in sport inquiry, and he would be aware, as I was, that when a certain rugby team was tested for performance enhancing drugs they were also tested for marijuana. </PARA>

To say that there is evidence about cannabis being good for anyone in sport is stretching a very long bow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a debate about the health effects of cannabis. As I say, there is more evidence emerging and more agreement about that evidence. I do not think anyone would want to say now, as people did 20 years ago, that there is no problem about smoking cannabis. People are now much more cautious about it. The AMA resolution properly says that what we need are appropriate and adequate education programs to encourage young people in particular not to start taking cannabis because of the health consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question is whether or not using such a medicine or pharmaceutical should be legal or illegal. Very often the two matters get dragged together in a very messy way. To this point the use of marijuana is essentially illegal. It is regarded as an illegal substance. I think any further decision about that should await the report of the national cannabis task force which will be reporting to the ministerial council on drugs very soon. It would be useful for us to await the outcome of that report rather than make any decision one way or another about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless I have misread his notice of urgency, Senator Coulter is not asking us to adjudge that today. He is asking us to endorse the AMA resolution. Given that it is only 10 days since that resolution became public, I do not believe that we are in a position to endorse it, but we can properly canvass some of the issues raised in it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come from South Australia, and in that state the legal management of cannabis is different from anywhere else in this country, except the ACT which has in fact put in place something very similar to the situation in South Australia. The aim of that program is to try to be reasonable with the management of cannabis, and to make that message of reasonable legal management clear. In making it clear to the community, we ask people to see the consequences of a sensible and appropriate management. On all the evidence, that is exactly what the outcome in South Australia has been. It has been picked up by the community. The state has not gone to the dogs, which might be one way of describing it, since those changes have been introduced. That also is not the case in the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those changes do not encourage people to push cannabis onto anybody, particularly our youngsters. They certainly do not encourage the manufacture or circulation of the drug. But what they do say is that if people have a small amount for their own use, that is not a major crime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 31 May refers to 1,300 people imprisoned for possession of small amounts of the drug. The best advice I have is that one should be cautious about those figures&mdash;very rarely are people with small amounts of the drug given a gaol sentence. However, if people were in gaol because they had done nothing more than be found with a small amount of cannabis, my personal view is that that is taking a mallet to smash a gnat. In the light of the consequences of imprisonment, let alone the cost of it, that does not seem to be an appropriate way of managing such cases. I am also advised that the 1,300 people in prison because of an association with marijuana, are usually there because of some other related matter. So I urge a caution on the use of those bald figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is undoubtedly a matter of grave concern to the community. The gravity has increased as the health impact of the use of cannabis has become clearer. I would strongly endorse the establishment of very comprehensive and adequate educational programs not only for school children but also for the wider community so that people understand the effects of the use of cannabis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter's motion clarifies the AMA's resolution on this matter. A lot of people in this place do keep an eye on the AMA's resolutions, but not everybody would know them. It is interesting and very constructive to note that I think this is the first time the AMA has pushed a resolution of this order which it has endorsed at its national conference. This represents a climate change within the AMA, presenting a balanced approach to management of this situation, and we should take heart from it. That has not been the history of some of the resolutions passed by the AMA in times past, so this resolution is worthy of note just for what it tells us about the AMA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The resolution deals with resource allocation to investigate the toxicology of cannabis, particularly with regard to the detection of quantities indicating impairment. Again, this goes to establishing a quick, easy test, like a breathalyser, which would indicate the level of cannabis influencing a person. Of course, the consequence would be that, having investigated a test and establishing it, what do we do with the evidence? We need to be clear about what we want to do with cannabis users before we actually go chasing money to establish tests if we will never use them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMA is moving to a resolution that is very much in sympathy with the program that we have in South Australia. From evidence I have seen, this program has not caused a major disruption of behaviour in the community in South Australia. We have here, though, one of those vexed questions of balancing a number of important issues, which is the charge of the ministerial council involving health ministers, Attorneys-General and police ministers. When the national task force reports to the ministerial council, that will be the place to make the best evaluation and to bring about the best conclusions for deliberation by governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thank Senator Coulter for bringing on this debate today. I also thank the AMA for having moved considerably in proposing and endorsing such a resolution. These are indications of some maturity in the community about this debate. In particular, it is based on fact rather than the preferred fictions that have washed around cannabis. Let us wait for full information in the task force report to the ministerial council. The government will then respond in the light of that considered body of evidence covering all the issues of concern here. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased today to have the opportunity to respond to this urgency motion moved by the Australian Democrats addressing, amongst other things, the possible decriminalisation of marijuana for personal use. There are a number of important issues we need to look at here, including, as Senator Crowley suggested, whether the drug taking of marijuana is a harmful process; whether it leads to other drug taking of so-called harder drugs; whether we should discourage the use of marijuana taking and, if so, how, and the AMA resolution refers to educational programs; and whether we should decriminalise the use of marijuana and, if so, the likely results.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line in all this is the question of whether Australian society would be better off if marijuana were decriminalised. Let me firstly look at the question of harm because it is much more cut and dried than Senator Crowley mentioned. The jury really has come to a verdict on these issues. In the minds of most responsible people there is no doubt that marijuana is harmful. The very aim of taking the drug in the first place is to alter one's mood, to give one a good feeling. Indeed, if one takes it chronically, one has a chronic feeling of feeling good. It is also somehow associated, however, with signs of senility at an early age. There are studies of teenagers who regularly use marijuana who actually have many symptoms of senility at an early age. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are short-term problems of concentration and coordination which are particularly relevant to driving, flying and other things requiring good coordination. Regular users claim that it focuses attention; but it actually means that one cannot do two things at once, so of course that focuses attention on the one activity that is left. The active ingredient for marijuana, which is delta 9 tetra hydro cannabricol, affectionately known by users as THC&mdash;unlike, for example, alcohol&mdash;is not cleared from the body within a few minutes of ingestion. An average sized joint of marijuana leaves traces in the body, because it is stored in fat, for up to one month afterwards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the so-called moderate smokers who would smoke three or four joints a week are never free of the effects of marijuana. It is a long-term, ongoing thing, even for moderate smokers. There is a very clear association between marijuana smoking and schizophrenia. A 15-year study of 55,000 Swedish conscripts, which was reported in 1987, showed a six-times higher incidence of schizophrenia amongst those who were regular or heavy marijuana smokers compared with the others. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr John Sherman, a Melbourne medical practitioner with a particular interest in the area, is quoted as saying, `I believe that cannabis in heavy doses can, in a lot of people, make them go mad'&mdash;a lay interpretation of schizophrenia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Morocco, for example, 40 per cent of hospital admissions for mental conditions are related to marijuana. Apart from the effects of marijuana on the psychological and nervous systems, it affects the lungs. It has been said that one year of cannabis smoking can produce as much sinusitis, pharyngitis, bronchitis, emphysema and other respiratory conditions as would be expected from smoking 20 to 40 cigarettes a day for 20 years. Marijuana smoke is more damaging than straight tobacco smoke. It has a higher incidence of lung cancer in the minds of most experts in this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Professor Patton, in evidence to a senate committee in the United States, said that lung damage amongst marijuana smokers has spread the prospect of a new crop of respiratory cripples being created. Apart from that, it also causes damage to genes, lowers sperm count and may damage the actual germ cells from which foetuses and subsequently babies are produced. It has an effect on blood pressure, with a rise of up to 50 per cent in some cases, so it is dangerous to people with pre-existing cardiac complaints. There is no doubt whatsoever that it is a very harmful drug. As more information becomes available, it becomes more and more clear that this is a very harmful drug. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next question is slightly more difficult: does it lead on to other drugs? The answer is probably yes. The question is: why is that? Is it cause and effect, or is it that people who are liable to take marijuana are also liable to take cocaine and other harder drugs? There is no doubt, however, that there is an association between hard drug users and a prior history of taking marijuana. The evidence, it is true to say, is not conclusive. But it is true, for example, that Alaska, which had the most liberal marijuana laws, also had the highest levels of teenagers taking not only marijuana but also cocaine. There is a trial study of people taking marijuana which shows that the effective potency is reduced as time goes on and there is a tendency to take higher and higher doses. Indeed, amongst some of those subjects there is a tendency to move from marijuana to harder drugs to get similar effects in terms of their mind-effecting abilities. So it is harmful, and clearly on that basis it should be discouraged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question then is: what should we do about the discouragement? One thing that I think we would all agree upon is the great need for educational programs. This is referred to in the first paragraph of the AMA resolution which I think everybody in this house would support. The educational programs, particularly those focusing on school children, have been pretty appalling. They have been ineffective&mdash;it has been difficult to find them, in many cases. One of the things that we would certainly support a bipartisan approach on is an effective anti-marijuana and other drugs campaign. NCADA Campaigns have been aimed very much at the hard drug end of the spectrum rather than at marijuana. I think we would agree on that part of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To a certain extent that is closing the stable door after the horse has bolted. The question before us today is: what should we do about legal sanctions? On the one hand, there is a view that it is inappropriate for personal use of marijuana to be a criminal offence. The argument goes that it does not work. The comparison has been made with murder. If people want to find out whether making murder a criminal offence has actually worked, the answer is no, people still murder each other. On the other hand, it probably has meant that fewer people get murdered and the likelihood of either being hanged or put in prison for a long time is somewhat of a deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps a fairer comparison is shoplifting, which is a fairly minor offence in many people's eyes. Should that be decriminalised? The answer in most people's minds is that it should not. In my view, no-one is forcing people of any age to smoke what is an illegal product in most states, and run the risk of obtaining a criminal record, which is the argument used by people. They say that the youth in our society should not have to face a criminal record for some minor indiscretion in their younger years. But the other argument is that if this is such a savage punishment for a so-called minor crime then in that case it surely is a very effective deterrent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crowley raised a couple of points about the number of people in gaol. I do not have the figures for Australia, but I have some figures for New South Wales. The figure which was quoted in the AMA debate, and subsequently quoted in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS>, was that there are 1,300 people imprisoned in Australia for marijuana offences. I am informed that in New South Wales the number of people actually in gaol for possession of marijuana is one. The rest are in gaol for associated offences or repeat offences. That really does put the criminal element of this into perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also add that in New South Wales&mdash;an example which is most commonly quoted&mdash;there is no criminal record associated with people under 16 years who are convicted of marijuana possession. With 16- to 18-year-olds, there are no obligations on the magistrate to record a criminal record and, if there is one, it is expunged after three years. For people over 18 years, such a criminal record is expunged after 10 years. So the case which is sometimes made that these people have a millstone around their neck because of one minor indiscretion does not hold water, and that is a very important issue to bear in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do all agree that minimisation is important. I guess the next question is: does decriminalisation affect usage? There is a range of views. The commonest view, put at one stage by NCADA, was that decriminalisation has no significant impact upon usage. I will use NCADA's basic data&mdash;and the figures have been interpreted by John Malouf, who is a very well-respected worker in the field&mdash;to compare the increase in usage in South Australia after decriminalisation, which occurred in 1987, with the rest of Australia. The increase in usage for the years 1988 to 1991, which are the years we have data for, are very interesting. In the 14- to 19-year-old age group in that period the increase in usage in South Australia was 57 per cent compared with 26 per cent in the rest of Australia. For the 20- to 39-year-old group it was 22 per cent in South Australia compared with eight per cent in the rest of Australia. For the over 40s, it was 45 per cent compared with 18 per cent in the rest of Australia. In every case the increase in usage was more than double in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can look overseas at the Alaskan and Oregon experiments. Alaska and Oregon are the two most liberal states in terms of their marijuana laws. They had 50 per cent to 80 per cent higher marijuana usage rates, particularly amongst the young, than did other states in the USA. Indeed, the problem in Alaska was such that, in 1990-91, the people of Alaska voted in a referendum to re-criminalise the usage of marijuana. I think even the proponents, however&mdash;to give the best shine on this from their point of view&mdash;would surely not claim that decriminalisation would lead to lower usage, which must surely, hopefully, be the aim of us all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A few issues were raised about the involvement of crimes. The fact is that marijuana usage by itself and its selling is really not a major criminal activity. The criminal activities, particularly the ones that are often referred to like housebreaking, and stealing of electrical goods as mentioned by Senator Crowley, are more often related to harder drugs. But the other side of this is that drug use in itself is actually the cause of much sociopathic behaviour. It is not necessarily just the finding of the money to fund the habit because, by and large, marijuana is not a particularly expensive drug. To focus on that issue distorts the argument somewhat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is the argument that criminal sanctions do not work. The opposite argument to that is: why make it even less an offence? If criminal sanctions are not working, it may be making a case for making the punishment even stiffer and taking a harder approach. I think that can be argued both ways: it is a very specious argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very clear, overall, that decriminalisation of marijuana can only lead to a very clear message being given to society and, in particular, to our children. There is only one message that they can take from that, which is that it is relatively harmless; that it is, in general terms, okay to take marijuana and, therefore, by implication, other drugs; and that they should go ahead. It gives tacit approval to drug taking. That is surely the wrong message that we want to give, particularly to the young in our society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well be that if marijuana were discovered today we would not want to decriminalise it. But the fact is that by changing from the current position and decriminalising it, we are giving a very clear, loud message which is exactly the wrong message we want to give. I take a simple view that it is illegal now, it is a criminal offence, and it should stay that way. The facts are very simple. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, it is a very harmful drug&mdash;harmful to health and social behaviour, and activities such as driving. It is not a victimless crime. The victims are pedestrians on the road who get knocked down by cars; children who may be deformed because of the effects upon the germ cells; and relatives and friends. It is not a victimless crime. There is an association with other drug use. Decriminalisation does lead to a higher usage, and we should all be agreeing that we need measures which discourage the use of drugs. We should certainly support educational programs aimed to that end. But I ask that question I asked at the beginning: will Australian society be better off because of decriminalisation of marijuana taking?  The answer to that is a resounding no. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin where Senator Woods left off, with the idea that somehow we are giving approval to young people to go ahead and smoke this drug if we decide to decriminalise it. I only need to cite the figures in the latest national drug survey which show that half of all 14- to 19-year-olds were offered marijuana in the last year; 25 per cent of them smoked it last year; 40 per cent have smoked it in the past; and one third of the adult population smokes or has smoked marijuana.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suggest it is virtually at saturation point now, and we must move to reduce that consumption level. Until such time as we can have open, fair and reasoned debate and, in particular, an open education system in our schools, we are not going to be able to get the message across, as Senator Woods so clearly put, as to the harm that marijuana does. At the moment, because it is not on the table and openly discussed in schools, along with tobacco and alcohol products, it is seen by young people as something that most of them normally do. They are partaking of that type of behaviour without the full understanding of the short-term and long-term damage that it is doing to their health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This motion is about harm reduction. We are not going to have schools happy to have an open education program about a substance that is illegal. Indeed, we are not going to have governments openly talking to people and educating the population&mdash;because, as Senator Crowley said, that kind of education process must go well and truly beyond schools.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a former health educator, I know that in the South Australian education system, with the HIV dangers, we finally got discussion on the injectable drugs back on the table in the classroom. In many schools in other states, in particular in Queensland's education system, drugs cannot be openly discussed. Students cannot come into a classroom and discuss their problems with taking marijuana, or problems that their friends are experiencing, because it is an illegal substance and they could get themselves a criminal record for being in any way involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to quote from a couple of articles, and particularly look at the nonsense with regard to prohibition being the way to reduce the consumption of anything and, consequently, reduce harm. If we look at arbitrary prohibition, we will see that it has failed throughout history. It failed in Turkey, which tried to ban coffee. It failed in America with regard to alcohol. We all remember the TV programs with Elliot Ness shooting machine guns at anything that moved all around Chicago. It has failed in South Africa, where racial mixing was arbitrarily banned. All around the world any attempt to limit illegal gambling and prostitution has failed. We can see from the figures I quoted earlier that prohibition is certainly not working in Australia when it comes to the use of marijuana. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.That, given the evidence of the physical, psychological and social harm arising from cannabis use, National Conference reaffirms the AMA's determination to support any measures, particularly educational programs, proven to reduce its use.</PARA>
<PARA>I state very clearly that those full and open education programs cannot go ahead while marijuana is an illegal substance. I move on to the harmful effects of having either a criminal record or being locked away in a prison. As Senator Crowley said earlier, our first case of HIV transmission in gaols has been proven. Drug taking in gaol is an extremely risky activity. Surely we do not want to be locking away 1,300 people for marijuana related offences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the risks of a criminal conviction, we also need to look at the employment prospects of people who have that criminal conviction hanging around their neck&mdash;people in their 20s and 30s. I think we need to look at the link between unemployment, which is what they are facing with such criminal convictions, and low health status. This brings me to the second and the fourth points in the resolution of the AMA. The fourth point reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.That, to minimise the social harm arising from the possession of a criminal record, National Conference recommends that, in relation to use, or possession of small amounts of cannabis for personal use, a criminal conviction should only be recorded for repeat offenders.</PARA>
<PARA>In my last 60 seconds I wish to touch on the statistics in South Australia. What we have in South Australia is not increased usage. I challenge honourable senators to prove that we have, and, with surveys of the population, to compare the usage in South Australia with that in Queensland or in any other state. What we have is a very strict policing practice. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to confine my remarks to one aspect of this debate, which is covered in points 2 and 4 of the AMA resolution from the 1994 national conference. I note in passing that all four points of the resolution are supported by several other groups, including the Public Health Association and the Australian Parliamentary Group for Drug Law Reform. I will not deal with the question of the harm of taking marijuana, but rather with the question of decriminalisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The criminalisation of marijuana use has had several undesirable consequences. If we look first at prison being used as a penalty, we see that it is a hopeless penalty for the individual. It does not help and it exacerbates the problem that it is purporting to address. For people who fear a link to hard drug use, entry to prison is the very best way to encourage that link. Prison should always be the penalty of last resort to protect the community or to protect individuals from being a risk to themselves. Using prison as a penalty does the reverse; it increases the risk to which we will be putting individuals. Whether they are more at risk or not, gaining a criminal record sets people at a disadvantage from the rest of the community for the rest of their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I move on to using prison as a deterrent. There are two ways of using deterrents. Firstly, there is the specific deterrent&mdash;that is, trying to deter people from repeatedly using the drug. I have already said prison does not work in that respect and, in fact, is more likely to encourage or exacerbate use. Secondly, there is the general deterrent&mdash;that is, a deterrent to other people who, hopefully, do not use the drug already. It does not work on the right people. It may well lead the people who are making a profit, who are dealing in and distributing marijuana, to go to greater lengths to avoid detection. It may deter them from marijuana use, but it does not deter them from the damaging practices in which they are engaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Lees remarked, it is an opportunity that encourages our children to lie. To try to protect their own families from the truth that this is a social reality makes it impossible for them to speak out about the current state of our society in relation to the use of this drug. Illegality hinders the positive attempts of looking at the problem of addressing preventative, educative or rehabilitative programs towards curbing the difficulties that are raised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminalisation also encourages black market trade. It drives the trade underground, and this guarantees exploitative marketing practices. It not only allows countries in Asia to be economically trapped by the demand for drug crops and cash crops, but it also affects people struggling to survive in Australia. Honourable senators would be surprised and disappointed, I am sure, to realise that many farmers can be tempted to get involved right now to keep their families away from of bankruptcy, and use the family farm to gain some cash crops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Criminalisation is the wrong end of the problem to begin with. Prohibition should have taught us that. In case honourable senators do not believe me, I want to quote from a newspaper article, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Earlier this year Queensland's Criminal Justice Commission released preliminary data indicating cannabis was Queensland's second most valuable cash crop, with a street value of more than $640 million a year, after sugar cane.</PARA>
<PARA>Please do not laugh when I suggest that there are rural people in Australia who are very pressed, and the illegality is certainly not helping them, even though it might be tempting from an economic point of view. I will end by quoting an article by Mark Schneider, a journalist contributor to a column called `Thinking Allowed'. In an article called `Pro-Marijuana' in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Freo Herald</EMPHASIS> of 2 April 1994, he states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the previous prohibition on alcohol (a vastly more dangerous drug), the prohibition on marijuana achieves nothing. Despite the massive cost of enforcement and the tireless efforts of police and customs, the supply of marijuana is barely affected.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It's time for change. A reasonable first step to more rational drug laws is to decriminalise the use of marijuana. This has already been done in South Australia and the ACT, where possession of a small quantity results only in a fine&mdash;not a criminal conviction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was very impressed with Senator Wood's contribution to this debate, particularly in respect of the harm of smoking marijuana. I come from the trade union area too, where there is a growing concern about the problems of smoking marijuana and safe work practices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want now to directly address the motion before us. I am inclined to vote for this motion. I would not vote for the motion if I saw it as a motion in support of decriminalisation of marijuana smoking or usage. I do not see it as that; and I presume that the AMA does not see it as that. What it does see is that there is harm in the use of cannabis. Also, there are health consequences, and consequences of imprisonment, for offenders. The motion says in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">imprisonment should be replaced by compulsory rehabilitation programs.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought also that subsumed in that is the system of work orders as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment. Nothing in the AMA resolution indicates to me that it is in favour of the decriminalisation of marijuana. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Points have been made by Senator Rosemary Crowley, quite legitimately, that the resolution is only 10 days old and it is a bit early, I suppose, to refer to the failure of the `lack of action in relation to the following resolution of the 1994 National Conference of the AMA'. I do not know whether `lack of action' is directed to the government; or to whom it is directed. In any event, on the understanding that my vote is not to suggest that I am in favour of the decriminalisation of the use of marijuana, I will be voting for this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the educative role of the law still be maintained but in such a way as to prevent harm which results from the recording of a conviction and the imprisonment of offenders in relation to the intermittent use of the drug. On balance, and with those caveats, I will be supporting the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I note in passing that on 5 January this year the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> ran an article in which it described the high profile Liberal lawyer, Mr John Marsden, conducting a survey of Young Liberals which showed that 35 per cent had smoked marijuana. It suggests to me that if the figures quoted by Senator Woods are correct, perhaps there is some link between being Liberal and smoking marijuana, because those figures are higher than some of those he quoted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me also say that in relation to the wording of the motion&mdash;and I want to put this on the record&mdash;my original motion called for endorsement of the AMA resolution, and not for criticism of the lack of action. In fact, it was the Clerk of the Senate who said that this was not in conformity with standing orders. I have recently checked the standing orders and I do not find anything there which suggests we cannot endorse the AMA resolution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, let me answer some of the points that have been made. No senator here will find any criticism from me in relation to the health effects of marijuana. They have been well documented&mdash;lung cancer effects, change of mood and effects on driving ability. Senator Woods mentioned the effect on schizophrenia. I have several friends whose sons, I believe, have been tipped over into schizophrenia after heavy marijuana use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the question we are raising here. The question is: is the present treatment which treats these people who use small amounts of marijuana as criminals, recording criminal convictions against them, the best way to reduce that harm and also to reduce the wider harm in the community from that being a criminal activity, the supply of it being a criminal activity, and all the other activities associated with that?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our position is that there is less harm done by taking this new course of action than by dealing with this matter as a criminal fact. Senator Lees brought out very well the fact that while the small use of marijuana remains a criminal activity, the first part of the AMA motion, namely calling for a wider amount of, and more effective, education to dissuade people from using this drug becomes extremely difficult, particularly in schools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Picking up on schools, let me suggest to Senator Woods that one of the reasons the statistics in South Australia perhaps look worse than in other states is really a matter of reporting. He will know from epidemiological studies that where there are high degrees of reporting, the figures can be seriously distorted. If he looks, instead, at surveys which have been carried out in schools in the various states, he will find that consumption of marijuana in schools in South Australia is lower than in the other states. We would strongly support the aspect of the AMA resolution calling for more education. We urge strongly that that activity, as Senator Lees has pointed out, be discouraged by the very fact that it is a criminal activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point out that in that issue of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 5 January the then President of the Young Liberals, Mr Trent Zimmerman, reported that a motion had gone through the annual conference of the Young Liberals. That motion was that cannabis should be decriminalised. I understand that Mr Trent Zimmerman is now on the staff of Senator Robert Hill, so I am just wondering whether the Liberals, while they might vote against this motion, are not about to change their minds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that we really want to stress is that on the issue of the harm to the individual there is not a difference between us; the issue is the harm to those people and to the whole community by the method of treatment of this activity as a criminal activity. We believe that if that were to be changed and the emphasis redirected towards education&mdash;and away from that being a criminal activity&mdash;those people would be better off because there would be less of the drug; and there would be less harm to society as a whole. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this debate was adjourned before lunch I was answering a question that Senator Watson had put to me. I note that Senator Watson is not in the chamber but I am sure that, given his assiduous attendance during debates of this kind and his avid interest in matters tax, he will be in this chamber in a very short time. While I am waiting for Senator Watson to arrive, perhaps I could address some of the other elements of the debate that do not touch on the issues raised by him. I will pay him the due courtesy, when he is in attendance, of addressing the issues that he has mentioned. As I say, I am sure he will be here shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill deals with several changes to taxation law. It is an omnibus bill&mdash;that is to say, it is a series of bills put together under one cover and which therefore amends in a technical way a whole range of taxation bills. The opposition has indicated, as indeed so have the Australian Democrats, support for&mdash;or not opposition to&mdash;all of those bills save one, and that is a bill related to student HECS payments. It is in that area that there is disagreement and in that area there has been debate. The proposed changes to all of the other bills, I take it, have been therefore supported, and I expect assent will be given to them in this chamber with absolute support from all parties. But it is in the area of HECS that the debate has foundered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson indicated earlier that he would move an amendment. That was when we were here last week. This morning Senator Watson indicated that he will now not proceed with that amendment. I had acknowledged&mdash;as I think I am bound to, given that I do reserve the right from time to time to criticise opposition senators&mdash;that I believed an opposition senator had conducted himself in a principled and proper way. Senator Watson said that over the weekend he had further examined the issue, new information had come before him that caused him to change his mind and, as a consequence, he would not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public view of parliament is that we always disagree and that we somehow inflexibly cleave to our points, irrespective of the evidence. But this is a case in which a senator with new evidence has changed his point of view. I acknowledge that as sometimes being an issue that takes moral courage. I think I should therefore recognise that Senator Watson has exhibited that in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That action has not prevented, however, a spokesman for the Australian Democrats, Senator Bell, from making political sport at Senator Watson's expense. I gather that that will be something that Senator Bell will continue to do. As I have said to Senator Bell and the Australian Democrats, given there is a majority and support for this measure, it would indeed be instructive if we could have a consensus in this chamber and this legislation passed uncontested. That may not be the case; we may be faced with a dissent from the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now that I see Senator Watson is in the chamber I say that, while indicating what I have just said was his position and that of the parties that he represents, Senator Watson explicitly asked me a question in his remarks to me earlier. Under the forms of the committee stage, there is an obligation on me to reply to it. That question, as I recollect, arose from his discussions with a student leader at Adelaide University and related to what the taxing arrangements for HECS would be should students undertake work during their holidays. I referred that question to my expert tax advisers. I now have some notes, from which I will quote, which I hope will answer that question quite precisely. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Students working during holidays will be required to complete an employment declaration and give it to their employer in the normal way. That is the first point. The declaration will indicate whether or not those students have an accumulated HECS debt. The employer will then be required to make PAYE deductions in the usual way. As with all employees, if the rate of PAYE deductions reflects a rate higher than that required to meet those students' end of year tax liability, they are able to request from the Commissioner of Taxation a variation, as I understand it, in PAYE deductions under section 221(D) of the tax act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give another example. This mechanism is available for a taxpayer earning, say, $50,000 a year and having PAYE deductions based on $50,000 per year. In cases were a student or person works for half a year&mdash;say, from 1 January to 30 June&mdash;the section 221(D) variation would result in PAYE deductions based on $25,000 income being made&mdash;that is, on half the annual figure being made. I do know whether that answers precisely the point that Senator Watson has raised, but I notice a nodding of the head and I take that to be an affirmative. I now notice an uplifting of the hands and I take that as being not necessarily an affirmative. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While I was listening to the debate earlier, Senator Reid also put to me a question. Senator Reid's question, if I may paraphrase it, was: do the proposed changes to the collection of HECS mean that the calculation of child support payments by a non-custodial parent under the child support formula should be changed? I think that is a fair paraphrasing of the question asked by Senator Reid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My advisers have prepared for me an answer, which I will quote from. The changes made under this bill in relation to the collection of HECS through the provisional tax system and the proposed changes to be made by regulation in relation to the collection of HECS through the PAYE system&mdash;and there is some emphasis on the following words&mdash;do not change the amount of HECS that a person would be liable to pay in respect of a particular year. They simply change the timing of those payments. As such, there is no apparent need simply because of these changed payment arrangements to alter the way in which child support liabilities are calculated under the child support formula. For example, a non-custodial parent at the moment may have a HECS liability and this is not specifically taken into account under the child support formula. No-one pretends that the child support formula gives a perfect result in every case. In recognition of this, a child support review office was set up to enable a low-cost, informal review mechanism for custodian and non-custodian parents who are unhappy with the amount of child support being paid. The existence of a HECS liability would be a factor which could be taken into account in such a review. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware that Senator Reid is part of a committee currently looking at child support, the report of which, I understand, is due to be released in August this year. The government will be looking with interest to see what recommendations the committee makes. Having made those comments, I think that discharges me at the present time from the obligation of answering questions posed by honourable senators. I notice that there is some competition for the call. I will sit in my place and listen with interest to the contribution to the debate senators will now make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to confirm all that Senator Watson has said in the debate on this matter today and also to acknowledge the minister's references to the Senate process as being one where arguments, new information and new considerations can move us to adopt positions which we see are to the benefit of the legislation and the matters that are before us in a debate. It is the case that Liberal and National Party members, on matters of education and tax, have principles, objectives and values which have been expressed by Senator Watson, me and others in this debate last Thursday and today. In the light of other information and additional principles, we have withdrawn the amendment that was proposed by the opposition last Thursday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was quite a lot of discussion involving a dozen opposition members&mdash;in fact, the whole party room&mdash;on this matter. What emerged from that is the position which Senator Watson has rightly summarised to this chamber on our behalf, and that is that there will be no drawing back from the principles and the arguments that we were appealing to all along. Of course, we are critical of this government in a number of matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister is rightly generous. We ought to recognise that it is part of debate in the Senate to listen to what is said&mdash;to listen to each other and to listen to new information. Senator Watson has the full confidence of opposition members in the way he summarised this matter in his contribution to this debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to ask a couple of questions. I had a discussion with the tax department&mdash;that discussion will not go into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, unless there is an automatic plug into the minister's office&mdash;about what happens in the case of a PAYE employee who has provisional tax liabilities as well. It seems to me that that person could be hit with a double whammy. There would be the normal PAYE tax, then there is other income liable to provisional tax. We should bear in mind that provisional tax in the first year brings one year forward so that that person would virtually be paying twice. Can the minister give me an assurance that that person's liability will be as if both of those incomes&mdash;whether liable to PAYE or provisional tax provisions&mdash;come to the same amount? That is my first question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In case I do not get the call again in a hurry, I will ask my second question. In a situation where a taxpayer, with a HECS debt and liable to both PAYE and provisional tax, has a negative gearing aspect in his or her return, what happens? For example, if that person has an income in round figures of $40,000, and has $10,000 of negative gearing&mdash;taking the $10,000 from the $40,000 leaves a balance of $30,000&mdash;is HECS calculated on the $40,000 or is it calculated on the $30,000?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is. To answer Senator Panizza's first question, people will not be double counted if they earn part of their income as a PAYE taxpayer and part as a provisional taxpayer. Whatever appropriate amount they earn, they will be taxed accordingly in proportion to that so that they will not be double counted and will not be doubled up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the minister, perhaps because he was being distracted by Senator Hill at the time the question was being asked, has either misunderstood the question or has been ill-advised. I suggest to the minister that it simply takes the case of the realistic application of the question asked by Senator Panizza to determine that he must have been ill-advised. It is not possible, under the fortnightly repayment arrangement, for the tax office to determine what the taxpayer's taxable income will be when, as Senator Panizza said, the taxpayer may have a negative gearing aspect to his income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not care what the minister said previously; I would like him to address that question and answer it properly. It is not possible for the tax office to determine a taxpayer's taxable income during the progress of the year and to therefore apply or not apply the HECS liability as the case may be. The taxpayer may not be liable on his or her net taxable income at the end of the year, but of course on an income of $40,000 the tax office will assume that the HECS liability will kick in or become applicable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the minister's last answer was either ill-advised or inaccurate because the question that Senator Panizza rightly put was not properly answered. I would like to suggest that the new information that Senator Teague talked about did not include an answer to the question that Senator Panizza asked. If it did, I will be advised by Senator Teague, but I cannot understand how the information provided to the coalition could possibly have enabled it to change its mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That information still applies, there was nothing new, and I challenge anyone in the coalition to demonstrate that new information has been provided which changes the situation that was described by Senator Panizza. I would like the minister to either correct the information he just gave or tell me how it is that the tax office could possibly determine a taxpayer's taxable income halfway through the year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for his response in relation to HECS now being payable in instalments during vacation employment. I am sure that students will be particularly disappointed with this, particularly students who are required to undertake long periods of study, such as engineers, doctors and others. HECS will now be taken out of this valuable money they see as providing them with living expenses during their sojourn at university.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, when we thrust the responsibility back on the three tiers of the tertiary education sector&mdash;the students, the union and the vice-chancellors&mdash;we did so on the basis that it would subject this legislation to the same degree of rigorous analysis that we did. Also, I ask the minister for a concession&mdash;which I think could be forthcoming&mdash;that when the government introduces its legislation relating to the pro rata amounts issue, could it give this issue that has just been raised further consideration? Can vacation employment be exempted from the payment of HECS so that it starts after a course has been abandoned or when a course has been completed?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to take this opportunity to comment on an article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> referring to Mr John Mullarvey, the acting executive director of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, who allegedly said that he was happy that the opposition has finally seen sense. That sort of concept seemed to permeate the particular article. I must say that I took some little offence at the condescending nature of that comment. While I acknowledge that we gave way to the force of arguments raised by the three elements in the higher education sector, we did so on the basis that they would do a thorough and robust analysis of all the issues involved, including the sorts of questions that have been raised during this debate, some of which were of great concern to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say now that it is very much on the heads of those three bodies to take full acceptance regarding what they recommended to this party and the manner in which they leaned upon us. It would have been unreasonable for us not to accept the fact that, given their high learning and their interest in this particular subject, they did not participate in this debate without that very comprehensive analysis and on the basis of full consultation with the groups that they represented. </PARA>

I do not think that will take very much away from what is required, given the arrangements that the minister raised today in terms of the Acts Interpretation Act.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General comments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has taken tentative steps to establish Australia as a viable regional headquarter for multi-nationals. Can the Government advise whether any analysis has been made of the impact of these complex capital gains tax amendments on the attractiveness of Australia as a regional headquarter for American or European companies investing in the Asia Pacific region?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government advise as to how this Bill can be said to be constitutionally valid under section 55 of the Constitution which requires there be only "one subject of taxation", namely a tax upon income, given that the Bill purports to tax taxpayers on notional unrealised accruals and deemed capital gains when they have not sold any shares and the shares have depreciated in value or under a declaration of a unit trust where there has been no change in the legal or beneficial ownership of an asset and no disposal of the asset?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I repeat what I asked in second reading&mdash;why are the capital gains tax provisions necessary when there is already, within our complex tax system extensive anti-avoidance measures. The second reading indicated that the Government's intention was to catch them since they would have posed a significant threat to the revenue&mdash;this is not a satisfactory explanation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I strongly urge the Government to adopt this approach of introducing amendments in the House of Representatives as the standard procedure instead of its usual stunt of introducing amendments at the last minute in this Chamber. That having been said I am concerned that, for example, the new formulae in Division 19B are extremely complex and I am not confident that there has been sufficient time for everyone to "get their minds around" the amendments. I have received a representation that goes so far as to say the provisions are "of almost unprecedented mathematical complexity". This seems to be yet another area where the Government cannot make equity and simplicity run together .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Division 19B: Clauses 25,26,27 : Share value shifting</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">General comments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The value shifting provisions in Subdivision A of Division 4 of the Bill have attracted a lot of interest as the government would be well aware. In fact I would go so far as to say that the amendments are the most significant CGT amendments since the amendments to the "terrible twins" subsections 160M (6) and (7) in 1992. They address many of the prime concerns of the accounting industry although the industry still has some problems with the legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These few pages of legislation will potentially have a significant impact and will become an essential reference point for all tax professionals advising on structuring large and small companies alike. The provisions will have a large impact for one simple reason&mdash;it is very common in Australia for one company to control another given the existing control test. Given this it is of concerns that the provisions ignore whether a company actually makes a gain and whether the shares later fall in value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would also like to stress my concerns about the potential impact of these provisions on mums and dads companies. The Government will certainly need to engage in a publicity campaign aimed at small business so that small business does not inadvertently fall within the Division 19B net. I call for an assurance that it will do so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One might have reasonably thought that the existing anti-avoidance provisions would be sufficient to overcome the type of abuse that could occur if, for example, a tax payer entered into a gross value shifting arrangement such as those identified in various death duty avoidance arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian entities owning operations overseas face difficulties without these value shifting complications be added. The share value shifting provisions will make the raising of new capital by private companies extraordinarily timorous. The share price at which new capital has to be raised will required considerable precision and the fact that the provisions will extend to capital changes undertaken by subsidiary companies far remote from Australian operations damns them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Another of the consequences of these provisions is that conservative practitioners who did not carry out the artificial transactions at which the provisions are targeted seem incompetent for not having engaged in them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also have concerns about the cost of monitoring and complying with the share value shifting provisions on the corporate community. They will far outweigh the tax lost to those who innocently run into a shift of share values.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now turn to some more particular comments about the value shifting provisions. It appears that the value shifting provisions could apply to public floats (where shares will often be offered at a discount on market value to obtain full coverage for the issue) and section 26AAC employee share schemes (where shares will be issued at a discount on market value to employees). I have real concerns about this. The object of the original provisions was to overcome situations where value shifting creates the effect of a disposal of a share or shares without an actual disposal for CGT purposes. The potential application of these provisions to public floats and employee share schemes is surely an unintended consequence of the provisions. When they are available on a widespread basis they are normally on commercial terms and will not be transactions which are contrived to overcome the effects of the CGT provisions. These should clearly be exempted from the value shifting provisions in order to avoid confusion as to which provisions take precedence and, at worst, result in a double taxation impost or multiple cost base adjustments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government give an undertaking to examine this issue closely with a view to excluding such transactions and employee share plans from the operation of Division 19B?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My next point is that page 14 of the supplementary explanatory memorandum concedes that both subsection 160M(7) and Part IVA may continue to apply to share value shifting arrangements. It states that where new Division 19B applies subsection 160M(7) will not operate&mdash;but that the operation of Part IVA is not excluded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government advise as to the policy behind excluding the operation of 160M(7) but not Part IVA?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government advise why this is in the Explanatory Memorandum and not in the Bill itself&mdash;is it purporting to make law by Explanatory Memorandum?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The EM also advises that to the extent that a share value shift is addressed by the specific provisions of Part IIIA relating to the issue of bonus shares those provisions apply to the exclusion of new Division 19B.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government give a firm assurance that bonus shares will only be dealt with under Part IIIA (given that there is no explicit exclusion clause).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Division 19B does not offer rollover relief to corporate groups with respect to value shifting arrangements. I call on the Government to give further consideration to this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">My final series of questions with respect to the share value shifting provision raise some interesting points. Can the value shifting provisions be used to avoid tax in the situation where a non-resident shareholder shifts value into shares held by Australians to increase their cost base? How can a capital gains tax liability be enforced against such a non-resident shareholder if it is a resident of certain treaty partners, where the treaty limits Australia's taxing rights as to capital gains? How can any capital gains tax liability be enforced against such a non-resident shareholder in any case, if it has no assets in Australia and the shares from which value has been shifted are subsequently worthless?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clause 26: proposed section 160 ZZRO: materiality test</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The materiality test only requires a shift in market value of more than the lesser of 5% in value or $100,000 which is not a very material for a large corporation. I urge the Government to give very serious consideration to revising the test to 10 or 15% or $0.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government surely appreciates after speaking with business groups that the low materiality threshold test will create practical problems for corporations. Taxpayers may find themselves inadvertently within Division 19B, for example, by simply failing to precisely value a company which they control when subscribing for additional shares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clause 26: proposed sections 44&mdash;46 : Companies ceasing to be related</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 45 of the Bill  relates to companies ceasing to be related after section 160ZZO application. Its amendments to section <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">160ZZOA</EMPHASIS> do not reflect the tenor of the relevant attachment to the 12 January announcement of the CGT changes, which this Bill incorporates.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Section 160ZZOA is an anti-avoidance provision designed to avoid abuses of the company rollover provisions of the CGT provisions. That section currently operates in circumstances where two group companies have taken 160ZZO rollover relief in relation to the transfer of an asset and the transferee company is not the "ultimate holding company" of the group of companies. Should the transferee company cease to be a subsidiary of the ultimate holding company after the transfer of the asset, then the transferee company is taken to have disposed of the rolled over asset for an amount equal to its market value at that time and to have immediately reacquired the asset for the same amount, thus bringing to account for tax purposes the capital gain inherent in the asset. Given the 100% beneficial ownership requirement needed to qualify a company as a "subsidiary" of another company it is easy to see that the transferee company would cease to be a subsidiary of the ultimate holding company should any part of that 100% relationship be broken.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ownership test was seen to give rise to unintended adverse consequences for large wholly owned company groups where each company (except the ultimate holding company) would be considered a subsidiary of all other companies.  The proposed amendment will exempt an "eligible sub-group break-up" from the adverse impact of section 160ZZOA. However the definition of "eligible sub-group break up" does not give full effect to the 12 January announcement. It restricts the benefit of the amendment to corporate reorganisations where a complete disposal of the relevant sub-group wit the result that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if all shares in the relevant companies of the sub-group continue to be beneficially held by the ultimate holding company of the group then the provisions of section 160ZZOA are not triggered:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if all shares in the relevant companies of the subgroup are completely disposed of by the ultimate holding company and any related company to unrelated parties then 160ZZOA will not be triggered; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">if any percentage beneficial ownership interest (other than 100%) in those relevant companies of the sub-group is transferred by the ultimate holding company or by an related company to an unrelated party, then the beneficial effect of the proposed amendment to section 160ZZOA will not be available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There does not appear to be any policy reason or logic for denying the beneficial effect of the proposed amendments to reorganisations where a less than 100% interest in the sub-group is disposed of to an unrelated party.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS>The provisions as drafted, I therefore argue, are too narrow and operate inequitably.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Will the Government give an assurance that it will give further consideration to those situations?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Clauses 50&mdash;53: Amendment of Assessments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 50&mdash;53 seek to enlarge the Commissioner's powers to issue an amended assessment in relation to capital gains. Currently the Commissioner has four year to amend an assessment, commencing at the date tax is payable under the original assessment. Clause 52 of the Bill attempts to remedy certain problems with the existing provisions but create its own. It appears to give to give the Commissioner unrestricted time limits for issuing amended assessments in respect of capital gains even where there has been no delay between the contract date and the disposal date. This is a matter of concern and I would hope only a matter of poor drafting and not the result of a policy decision.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where a taxpayer disposes of an asset under a contract entered into more than four years before the time of disposal these amendments create difficulties for the taxpayer. An example would be the disposal of land under a terms contract in 1987 but the title to the land would not pass until 1993. By the time there had been an actual disposal the Commissioner would be too late to tax the capital gain.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 52 attempts to remedy this by removing all time limits on the commissioner's powers to issue assessments where an asset has been disposed under a contract or as a result of compulsory acquisition.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will very quickly give a response, but we are getting to a point where I should acknowledge that Senator Bell has fought assiduously for his corner.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell's question asked whether or not I answered Senator Panizza's question correctly. The answer is: yes, I did answer that question correctly. We are talking about provisional tax. The nature of provisional tax is that a person estimates his or her earnings. If there is a possibility of a tax gain because of negative gearing, that is taken into account, and the person would be aware of it when the earnings are estimated. But when tax is paid, it is paid on the actual earnings. So the HECS is paid on the actual earnings. My answer, therefore, to Senator Panizza was right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other question that has been asked of me is a question more in the form of an observation; nonetheless, it is a serious question by Senator Watson as to whether holiday earnings by students could be exempted.

It is not before the chamber for debate today, but it will come up in this chamber when that legislation comes forward. We will certainly have a look at the concerns that Senator Watson has raised, take them on board, give them due consideration and report on an outcome. We will deal with that at the time that debate arises. If there is a need to do anything, if we are of the opinion that something should be done, we will deal with it at that time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me assure Senator Cook that my purpose in asking these questions and insisting on answers is not to prolong the debate but to clarify it. I think so much of this debate has proceeded without consideration of the multifarious questions which arise from these proposals. I appreciate that Senator Panizza's question was essentially about provisional tax. However, he did indicate that it may be a partial provisional tax liability. I listened to that because I had a question which related to a PAYE taxpayer and a salary earner in a somewhat similar situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not have to give specific money figures to consider the principle. If a taxpayer is earning slightly over the threshold, but has deductions which are likely to bring that earning below the threshold, the new proposals will extract HECS payments from that taxpayer throughout the year. While on actual taxable income that taxpayer would not be liable to start repaying the HECS debt, under the new proposals the HECS debt repayment will be extracted throughout the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely that is an inequitable position and a position which, if not entirely parallel with that put by Senator Panizza in his question, is at least related. I therefore ask the minister how it is possible for the Australian Taxation Office to determine whether people's taxable income at any point involves them in repayment of their HECS liability. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator Cook</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I answered a similar sort of question a moment ago, and my answer to this question is really the same. It is open to the taxpayer to apply to the tax commissioner for a section 221D variation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That illustrates my point that these provisions are highly unnecessary. If people want to vary their tax payment instalments, they can do it through that existing section. The government is really only hastening the repayment and putting itself in the position of acquiring the money from taxpayers, using it for a year and then refunding it. It is sleight of hand, and a dishonest sleight of hand at that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have another specific question. I would like to know what the tax office could do to restore equity to people who will be greatly disadvantaged because of these measures. I describe a situation which is not uncommon, particularly within government departments, where employees have reached an agreement with their employer&mdash;in many cases, the employer is the government&mdash;that upon successful completion of each year of study their HECS liability will be refunded by the employer. The agreement is that employees defer their HECS payment, present evidence of successful completion of that year's study to the employer and, upon presentation of that evidence, their HECS liability will be met by the employer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new regime, the proposition is that the HECS debt will be extracted from employees through the PAYE system. Employees will then be left in a situation&mdash;remembering that this situation applies to a lot of government employees&mdash;where they will be considerably out of pocket. We are talking about $50, $60 and $80 per fortnight. At the end of the time, the employer will have great difficulty in being able to assess just what should be reimbursed. That is an administrative complication which, I would suggest, is unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose that the answer from the advisers will be, `That is a matter between the employer&mdash;whether it be a government department or not&mdash;and the employee.' It is not a matter between employer and employee because it has been complicated and extended by these propositions. As I said at the beginning of my contribution to this debate, it is quite apparent that these provisions are unnecessary and only serve to hasten repayment to the government and, in doing so, cause the inequity that I have described. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the answer is that this is a matter between the employer and the employee, since it is a matter which has caused considerable hardship, it becomes a matter in which the government is fundamentally involved.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not going to answer that it is a matter between the employee and the employer. Obviously, a student who is a taxpayer has a primary obligation to meet his or her tax bill with the government. The honourable senator is talking about occasions where, by way of offer of employment or by way of appreciation of the tertiary training that an employee is undergoing, a particular employer will arrive at an agreement to meet a particular employee's HECS payment. That is a negotiated or agreed term of employment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is contingent, in the example that the honourable senator has given, on the student successfully completing the year. I do not know&mdash;I am not sure whether anyone does&mdash;whether an employer would want to vary that to reflect satisfactory progress during the course of the year. That is something that is between the employee and the employer but it is no different in these circumstances to the situation that would normally obtain, and that is that the taxpayer would meet his or her obligation when it falls due. If that person has done well, he or she will be reimbursed at the appropriate time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry but I have to seek further clarification. Under these proposals, the taxpayer will have money extracted on a weekly or fortnightly basis. The opportunity for the employer to contribute is contingent upon successful completion of studies, and evidence of that would come at the end of the year. That means that the employee will be out of pocket during the year, unable to get a reimbursement until the end of the year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill's amendments to Division 16E do not bring securities within the scope of the Division that are not currently within its scope.

I do not know the precise number. The number of pages of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act has doubled since 1985. I am concerned at the complexity of this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first question I asked was whether any analysis had been undertaken of the impact of the capital gains tax on the attractiveness of Australia as a regional headquarters for international companies&mdash;say American or European companies&mdash;investing in the Asia-Pacific region. The Tax Office has given a response, and I am thankful for that. The Tax Office is confident that that would not be the case. I wonder whether private sector tax advisers who advise overseas companies share the view of the Tax Office and the government as it relates to this legislation which includes measures such as the value shifting provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and the Tax Office obviously consider that those provisions are not a deterrent for incorporation of Australian regional headquarters by overseas companies. I wonder whether we might get a response from the Business Council. Is that view shared by the Business Council or the corporate tax association? It will be interesting to see whether those organisations share that view. No doubt they will tell us all at some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the second question, I asked about income tax. I will give the Senate an example. People are being taxed on a deemed capital gain when they have not sold any shares and the shares concerned have depreciated in value rather than being disposed of at a profit. How can they be so regarded? To my simple mind it seems to me that that would not be the subject, surely, of taxation upon income. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. The responses are detailed and they refer to the case of Harding v The Commissioner of Taxation. In that case the Tax Office said that this notional, hypothetical, unrealised accruing benefit was held not to represent a separate subject of taxation. I am advised that the Harding case dealt with an in-kind benefit formerly included as income under the UK income tax law of 1799. Apart from the answer to the question, I have not been advised that there is any authority for the proposition that something which is a loss of value, or neither a gain nor a loss, forms part of the subject of taxation comprehended by the term `income tax'. That is my comment on that matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other matter goes to the question that I asked about the definition of `controller' in clause 26 of proposed paragraph 160ZZRN (1)(c). I want to make this comment: if company law and the articles of association place control of a company in the hands of its directors, how can the phrase `controls the company' be applied to a person other than directors or de facto directors? The department is saying that the definition includes the case where a taxpayer controls the company. That taxpayer is neither a director of the company nor a de facto director of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now it appears that this term is going to extend to persons who have some sort of outside say over the directors of the company. It seems to me that it is questionable as to how that could occur. The department says that there are examples&mdash;and it is true that there are examples&mdash;in the explanatory memorandum, and they are there for honourable senators to look at. Explanatory memoranda are aids to the interpretation of the law if the courts so decide to use them as aids, but they are not to be substituted for the actual phrases and clauses in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apropos of that, Hepple's case in the High Court refused to allow an explanatory memorandum to make up for drafting deficiencies in the act. Mr Justice Deane suggested that taxpayers were entitled to clarity in legislation imposing tax. I am sure that all honourable senators would agree with those sentiments. As a lay person who nevertheless is a legislator, and as a taxpayer, I find it rather difficult to match the actual terms of clause 26 of proposed paragraph 160ZZRN(1)(c) with the example that is included in the explanatory memorandum. Time will tell, no doubt, but I do conclude by thanking the minister and the officers for the courtesy and efficiency with which they responded to the questions that I asked. </PARA>

While some may be traced by checking the employer on the last return lodged, this would need to be done manually and would not necessarily be accurate because it would refer to the last employer.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier this afternoon I inadvertently missed putting down a tabling speech referring to the development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, Garden Island, Western Australia. Given that there has been a lot of interest in this in recent weeks, I seek leave to make this brief statement on the tabling of that report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5F4">Senator CALVERT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report which was tabled deals with the further development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, Garden Island, Western Australia. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> is located on Garden Island, which is offshore from the city of Rockingham, some 60 kilometres by road south of Perth&mdash;Senator Panizza would know where that is. The need to further develop HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> stems from the government's two-ocean navy concept. This requires the provision of a secure base on the western sea board to support major fleet units operating in the Indian Ocean and minor fleet units operating, generally, close to the coastline. Additionally, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> will become the home base for the Collins class submarines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The overall development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> comprises three stages. Stage 1 was largely completed in 1978, with additional works progressing through to stage 2, which covers the development from 1989 to 1996. Stage 3 will extend the development from 1996 to the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal, which continues the stage 2 development, will provide additional operational, logistic, maintenance and training support prior to the planned stage 3 development. The works proposed in the development include a helicopter support facility, a small arms range, power house upgrade, aviation fuel storage expansion, training facilities, trials and research support facility, torpedo maintenance facilities and extension of the submarine training and systems centre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate will note that, while recommending the construction of the works in this reference, the committee is not yet convinced that a need exists for a small arms range at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>. The Department of Defence advised the committee at the public hearing that, following experience in the Gulf War, Somalia and Cambodia, it became apparent that naval personnel are in need of extra training in the use of small arms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although acknowledging that simulation can never fully replace actual practice on a firing range, the committee believes that simulation could form part of training. This simulation could then be completed by training at one of the army facilities on the mainland. The committee therefore recommends that the Department of Defence investigates the possible use of a simulated firing range at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, which could be used in conjunction with army firing ranges on the mainland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Should the small arms range eventually proceed, the committee would like to stress that it has been assured by the Department of Defence that only 2.5 kilometres of beach would be unavailable to the public when the range was being used, which would be up to about three days per week. Access would not be restricted on weekends or public holidays. I should also stress that the public has access to some 84 per cent of the island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was told at a public hearing that operational safety measures would include sentries, warning flags, notices in local newspapers and personnel allocated to restricting public access within the safety template. The Department of Defence informed the committee that, following advice from the army, the range is in accordance with military guidance and the safety template provided to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing, the committee was made aware by various environmental groups of the rare fauna and flora native to Garden Island. The fauna includes the tammar wallaby, the lynx skink, the carpet python and the brush bronze-wing. The Department of Defence advised the committee that it recognises that the native animal life on the island plays an essential role in its natural ecosystem. Accordingly, environmental management is aimed at maintaining the behaviour, diversity and ecological integrity of indigenous animal species. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of preserving trees native to Garden Island was brought to the attention of the committee; in particular, the Rottnest pines, the Rottnest tea-trees and cheesewood trees. The Department of Defence advised that every care is taken to preserve the flora on the island, with exotic species being controlled and possibly eradicated. The committee commends the Department of Defence on action taken to preserve the unique environment of Garden Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the public hearing the committee received the impression that non-government, environment and conservation groups believe that they were not adequately consulted or represented when decisions were made concerning environmental issues on Garden Island. The committee has therefore recommended that a representative of these groups be appointed to the Garden Island Environmental Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Defence has assured the committee that, to the best of its current knowledge, the total development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, including stage 3, would remain at 17 per cent, or 206.1 hectares of the 1,214-hectare island. This statement should therefore allay fears expressed by various groups that the navy plans to occupy the entire island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While recommending the further development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>, Garden Island, Western Australia at an estimated cost of $40.54 million at December 1993 prices, the committee has, as previously stated, recommended that the need for construction of a small arms range be further investigated. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the opposition, I make it quite clear that we do not support the motion that is before this committee. As the mover of the original requests&mdash;that is, the two items that have been circulated again today&mdash;in which we insist that this Labor government be accountable for what it announces to the public of Australia, we in the Liberal and National parties have not been moved to vary our concerns and the reasons for our seeking changes to this legislation. We are not moved to back away from the accountability that we believe the Senate must require of the government of the day in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is what happened: in the last budget in November, the government announced that with regard to Austudy eligibility&mdash;that is, benefits to help people study, to take up education in this country&mdash;that particular category of very hard-hit families in this country who are eligible for a health card on the basis of their small income would be, on that ground alone, eligible for Austudy without reference to an assets test. That is all that this measure requires. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only did the government announce it, but it was in the Austudy brochure circulated to all Austudy applicants. It was in the Austudy application form itself. It was only after the applications started coming in&mdash;in which families in dire circumstances, in situations of very low income, were applying for Austudy&mdash;that the government then decided to announce that that was not its intention after all. Many months had gone by and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to go over the whole debate. It is clearly set out in my speech of 11 May, about four weeks ago, when this matter was originally before us in the Senate. I reiterate all that I said then. I will be as brief as I can to say that I have read what the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, had to say on 30 May when our two requests for amendment came to the House of Representatives. In his speech, which was barely a few paragraphs, he did not give us any indication that he had understood the question of accountability that the Senate is requiring of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Free did not adequately address the concerns we had expressed in our speeches here. At the same time, on 30 May, my colleague Mr Andrews, the member for Menzies in Victoria, set out over several pages the position on this matter as seen by the Liberal and National parties and as was given originally by me, on behalf of our parties, in the debate in this place. I have read the speeches made in the House of Representatives. I concur with my colleagues' statements as summarised by the honourable member for Menzies.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is this government that we require to be accountable for its announced public statements. The government has estimated that there are some millions of dollars involved in this mistaken announcement to the public of Australia. The National Farmers Federation, for one, believes it to be an exaggeration. We have not got in the minister's speech any careful accounting for the estimate of the $10 million that he has set out. At another point, he acknowledges that it is at the moment only a relatively small number involved. Some weeks ago, he thought this would cost $25 million. He has changed his tune to $10 million. How do we know it is not much less than that?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is appropriate for this government to do things properly and with accountability. We in the Liberal and National parties are standing up for families in the bush and in the city, families which have a temporary drop in their income because of the recession that has hit them and because of the way this government has managed the economy. We are standing up for these families which, being eligible for health cards ought, by the government's own announcement, to continue to be eligible for Austudy as well. Therefore, the Liberal and National parties do insist on our requests. We oppose the motion that the minister, Senator Schacht has moved before the committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Schacht will have his turn. He can correct me then and I will listen to him. The government's budget commitment to exempt health care cardholders from the assets test has been demonstrated through the widespread distribution of material to this effect by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. In at least four documents, this assurance was given unequivocally. It was given in the 1993-94 DEET budget kit, a DEET press release heralding the budget change. Most misleading for students was the Austudy application guide and the 1994 Austudy guide to student finance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only were four commitments given by the government, but the information was also sent out to students who had their expectations built up and then shattered when they went to apply for and were refused Austudy.

He said it was a spectacular administrative blunder by DEET, an error in publicity material. That is what he said after giving a commitment in the budget. </PARA>

There are no more disadvantaged people in Australia than rural youth. They form a group that this government is totally ignoring. They cannot get Austudy because of their parents' assets in today's circumstances where they have had to face drought in western Queensland and western New South Wales and not been able to get a wheat crop in throughout Queensland and down into northern New South Wales.

Last year the minister announced that those with health care cards would get Austudy without assets tests or income testing. However, the Department of Employment, Education and Training issued a directive earlier this year reneging on that decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned before, the last time we debated the issue the Democrats, in particular Senator John Woodley, who has been involved in this campaign, put the case that the government should seriously consider keeping this promise. The Austudy booklet and information kits which were distributed contained the original decision by the minister. I think it has been quoted before, but I will repeat the two lines. In that booklet, the minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From 1994 the assets test of both you and your spouse generally won't be counted if your spouse holds a health care card.</PARA>
<PARA>We appreciated the move which the opposition made on that. We supported it then and we will now. The Australian Democrats have on previous occasions attempted to change or abolish this assets test measure, which we have always identified as being inequitable. We did so to assist farming and rural families because it is they who are stuck with assets that are not liquid, that are not easily transferable and that are not easily negotiable to produce sufficient cash to meet the cost of educating their children. We were disappointed when continually the opposition and the government voted together to prevent those people accessing those benefits. Once again, the evidence is there that education policy is bipartisan, between the government and the coalition. But we have tangible evidence that the coalition is enlightened enough to stick to the view that in fact there are elements of equity that should be followed here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are a little bit worried in our corner of the world that the government may well be flirting with this bill as a possible trigger for a double dissolution. Only last week Minister Cook referred to that possibility when debating the bill which gave us so much trouble earlier today, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1994. This is not my substantive argument but I think it would be wise of the minister to do what the previous minister at the table, Senator Cook, did and recognise where the numbers are and then follow the consensus of the chamber, because in this case the government is overwhelmed and should see the sense of the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time that this matter was being debated the minister put forward the excuse to the chamber that the government was concerned that a number of Collins Street farmers, to describe them in a colloquial way, may see the benefit of contriving to change their circumstances so that they could in fact benefit from receiving a health care card, thereby being eligible for Austudy as well. I appeal to the minister to listen to this case: the stupidity of that line is revealed by the fact that at the moment we do not have hordes of Collins Street farmers applying for the health care card and the considerable benefit that that brings. If there had been a loophole which had allowed that and they had seen the benefit, they would be there in their hordes already. They patently have not. I do not see many examples of the sorts of people the minister was describing cruising around using their health care cards. The contrivance which would be necessary would be so humiliating that I think the gain would not be worth the pain of changing their circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to the minister that we do not have rows and rows of Collins Street farmers on health care cards at the moment. That would be the case if what he described as a risk actually existed. That excuse was also given by Mr Free when he spoke about this matter in the other place. Quite frankly, I think that risk is over-stated. It does not recognise the reality that these people could at the moment contrive to put themselves in that situation and certainly have not. So I think the fear there is entirely misplaced. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of political points have been made here that cannot be ignored. Those opposite&mdash;not the Democrats&mdash;have attacked this government for not reducing the budget deficit as much as they would have liked. They wanted it to be below $10 billion. They are always screaming, `Cut government expenditure, reduce taxation and balance the budget.' That is their economic policy. But in this isolated case they are screaming that they want another $10 million to be spent when, at the macro level, they are arguing that they want the deficit reduced further, they want government spending cut. But they, as a permanent opposition, are never willing to indicate where that expenditure should be cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite cannot have it both ways. They cannot scream out for fiscal rectitude by reducing the deficit and then, in every individual case in which they see an advantage by providing some political opportunity for a political sectional group in the community, claim that they want to spend more money on that group. One reason why those opposite have been in opposition for 11 years is that they cannot work out the overall macro picture and explain why macro settings have to be right and, in particular, how we can reduce the deficit at the same time as wanting to increase expenditure for every pressure group that turns up to curry favour for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is about the health care card itself. As I have just said, there are people out there who will work out a way to what I would call rort it.

For anyone who gets it, it may add up to a few hundred dollars benefit at the most per annum. But as a result of that health care card, people can get hold of the Austudy allowance&mdash;for those who come from rural areas in particular, that includes the living away from home allowance&mdash;a $6,000 a year benefit. That will be attractive to some people. They might get their smart accountant to work out a way to minimise their income for one month of the year to get the health care card, knowing that once they get it they can then get an Austudy allowance worth $6,000 a year.

They would be able to show that they are eligible for a health care card and could then claim an Austudy allowance of $6,000 a year. If they have three or four kids between the ages eligible for Austudy for education purposes, they may be looking at three or four times $6,000&mdash;that is, $18,000 or $24,000 a year.

The minister referred to benefits to isolated children and said that the Liberal and National parties are the heroes in Australia for having established benefits for isolated children.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the minister tried to put what he called a political point. He said that that political point was about the deficit. The deficit in the Australian budget is too high. Through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, I put two simple points to Senator Schacht. We do not accept the $10 million estimate that the minister and Mr Free referred to. It is an exaggeration, and we do not believe that that is the case. The government has not demonstrated that it is anywhere near that amount. And I put the argument back that actually this legislation has a number of very good elements to it that we support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Hang on. Those are disciplines that will limit overpayment, that will tie together benefits under veterans' entitlements, the Social Security Act and the Austudy provisions, for example, and we believe these disciplines are fair for all taxpayers and that they will save taxpayers and the government money. The savings are much greater even than $10 million. If the government does not go ahead with this legislation for want of the two amendments on this one matter, the government will make the deficit worse and, therefore, the responsibility for lowering the deficit relies upon the government accepting this legislation that it has moved. We called for the disciplines with regard to Austudy, we called for the saving of taxpayers' dollars, and it is in this legislation. The legislation will not proceed if Minister Free and his colleagues in the government do not accept this reiterated message from the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Reference was made to the health care card. Senator Schacht's rhetoric, his debating point about Collins Street farmers, fell flat last time and it has fallen flat again. He says that all the fast accountants will fix their affairs through a great loophole that we are opening up. That was his term&mdash;`they will fix their affairs'. He shed all sorts of crocodile tears about how all sorts of wealthy Collins Street farmers would fix their affairs to take advantage of this health care card provision. But he cannot show me one who has already done it; they do not exist. The minister puts up a straw man, and it is not convincing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point is the minister's reference to families who are struggling in the rural recession who happen to have a large asset. We acknowledge that this occurs. But he wants to deny the children of those families access to secondary and tertiary education. He is saying, `Don't worry about the farm boys and the farm girls, the rural families of Australia.' He is saying, `If their parents have an asset that in normal times is substantial and that normally would preclude them from access to secondary and tertiary education assistance, we won't have anything in our hearts for those children in those families when the recession means that they haven't got an income that could pay for their studies in a school or a university.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties have different values from that. We are saying there is a temporary problem regarding these normally asset rich families. But we will not see the children of the bush suffering the denial of secondary or tertiary education on that account. It is a strongly held value within the Liberal and National parties that we will stand up for rural children, we will stand up for the bush&mdash;and we will stand up for anyone in the cities who is in like circumstances. It happens to be the case that increasingly over the last decade those who have least access to education in this country are from rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Studies at the Australian National University on participation in higher education demonstrate again and again that the children of families living in rural areas have the lowest access to higher education in Australia, and we will not allow this measure to be taken away from the bush by a hard-hearted Labor government.

He must be joking! There are enough advantages for the government in this legislation that it would cut off its nose to spite its face if it did not agree to this legislation going ahead. It is to the advantage of taxpayers, to the advantage of the government's budget, and it is to the advantage of sensible outcomes of debate in parliament that this legislation proceeds, and it will proceed on the basis of the Senate amendments being agreed to. </PARA>

Is the minister going to tell me that that was such an abject failure, that the handful of people who trotted along and made application was a good reflection of the government's publicity at the time? If a couple of us talking about it for a few minutes in this chamber is going to publicise it to such an extent that the government is going to be overwhelmed by these fast accountants, I really think one must question the value of any publicity that the government gives. Senator Boswell reminded the minister that it was printed in the booklets that were distributed right to the target audience, right into the place where the people who were concerned would find out.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This is the first environmental audit of AIDAB operations which has been carried out entirely by external consultants and it is worth noting that the work was guided by a steering committee with representatives from CEPA, DEST, AGFOA and AIDAB. The audit was designed&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to assess AIDAB's implementation of internal environmental procedures and judge the contribution of AIDAB's program to achieving ESD.</PARA>
<PARA>While we have had the report for only a short time, a glance is all that is necessary to give the reader an uneasy feeling that the environmental principles which underlie AIDAB's aid programs may be seriously flawed. For instance, there is a rewriting of what ESD&mdash;ecologically sustainable development&mdash;should mean in the implementation of programs. Page 2 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Central to ESD is the notion that continued economic and social development is essential if human impact on the biosphere is to be reduced while providing people with more options rather than fewer and improving their quality of life. The challenge is to ensure that such increases in economic activity have steady or declining impacts on the biosphere at levels which are ecologically sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA>This is counter to the widely accepted definition used in the Brundtland report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Our Common Future</EMPHASIS> which has ESD in a proper perspective by stating that ecologically sustainable development means&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . meeting the needs of the present generation without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.</PARA>
<PARA>As the recommendations from the auditors points out, there would even appear to be confusion in AIDAB about how to define the environment without reference to ESD. Recommendation 2 says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a need for clear working definition of `environment' as distinct from ESD.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 11 of the report the report limits the definition of environment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . for this audit only the impact on the `natural' environment was considered; this includes the components of land, (including agricultural land) air, water and biota but not people and the constructed environment (ie. buildings, roads etc.)</PARA>
<PARA>It is worth noting that the auditors are critical of the marker system used throughout the report. But one of our greatest concerns is the complete over-emphasis on the ESD, particularly bearing in mind the definition that the study was using. The auditor's report says of this that any analysis based on the ESD marker would at present be misleading. Any desktop environmental audit has three important facets which must be in place to assure the value of the audit. The first is the value and depth of the information provided to the audit. Many of the recommendations of the external auditor will cover this matter. The second is the terms of reference and so-called scope of services that set out the task of the auditor. The final facet is the quality of the auditors, and it is unfortunate that it appears the report does not provide any background on the auditors other than the names of the people involved. I cannot stress strongly enough that, if we are going to have reports that profess to concern themselves about ecologically sustainable development, they should actually address that and not incorporate the goals of economic rationalism that have growth&mdash;and limitless growth&mdash;regardless of the impact it might have ensconced within it. </PARA>

<PARA>This report focuses on the progress of 25 area strategies throughout the country and describes the main achievement, if we can call it that, of each strategy in 1992-93 against program objectives for each state and territory. These 25 areas which were originally proposed by the states are very different in nature, ranging from new or upgrading existing road, water, sewerage, infrastructure. Others involved the redevelopment of industrial sites, obsolete port, rail and industrial land, the revitalisation of inner city living, housing, redevelopment and new open space areas. The report acknowledges:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . that overall progress in 92/93 was less than anticipated but that action has been taken regarding the delays and progress since then, and indicates that 93/94 evaluation should show a marked increase in levels of activities.</PARA>
<PARA>At the Senate estimates hearing in September 1993 and, I remind honourable senators, well into the year following the program, a number of concerns were expressed by the department. At this time, concerns were expressed to the committee by departmental officers that milestones were not spelt out adequately, that they were inadequate in their reporting of back data and that some of these agreements had to be revised due to the lack of tight planning in their initial preparation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I read this report and see that 18 out of the 25 projects undertaken have experienced some sort of delay, it merely highlights this government's mismanagement of the original agreement negotiations. I remind the Senate that the building better cities program, when it was originally initiated, was the fillip of the Labor Party leading into a federal election campaign. There were many carrots put forward at that time, and many of these projects. </PARA>

The words `milestones are not being met', `strategy has been minimal' and `behind schedule' also appear time and time again. It is a report of a program that was obviously ill-conceived, poorly administered and carried out through the basis of an election campaign.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Greens WA support the concept of a better cities program in principle, but this program has done too little and, unfortunately, is winding down under the government's deficit reduction strategy. This is a very short-sighted attitude. The community will ultimately pay enormous environmental and social costs if our cities are not restructured properly. It should be noted in this context that the majority of Australians live in cities and, therefore, the Greens consider the program essential from the standpoint of energy conservation, social equity and environmental quality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is potentially a major component of any plan to make our cities ecologically and socially sustainable. There are initial costs involved with making some of those changes, but most of those changes make savings in both environmental and social terms as well effecting savings to the economy in the medium term. It is extremely difficult for states to do that without that initial incentive because the federal government is cutting down its grants to the states year by year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are currently faced with massive problems in our cities. Car dependence in Australia is amongst the worst in the world, and this has resulted in massive urban sprawl and traffic problems. Pollution levels are dangerously high in many Australian cities, with high levels of ozone, lead, carbon oxides, nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, benzine and aromatic and polycyclic hydrocarbons. Demographic problems have also arisen, with low income earners being squeezed into the poorly serviced urban margins and being caught in the poverty trap that we have heard so much about in the last few days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are soaring costs of physical infrastructure as the urban sprawl continues and there is massive pollution of waterways. There is increased demand for resources such as wood, water, brick, stone, et cetera and an increase in crime rates as the sense of community that once maintained cohesiveness disappears. Proper restructuring of cities could reduce energy use substantially; could reduce imports of cars, steel, oil et cetera; could reduce the need for roads and parking; could provide significant real employment; and could create a healthier and more sociable society. The better cities program is certainly valuable, but the states unfortunately maintain a commitment to roads and urban sprawl. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that context, the current debate concerning the shift to put more funds into general grants is of great concern. The Commonwealth government has an important role to play in promoting ecologically and socially sustainable cities, and therefore the Greens feel strongly that this ought to be part of their criteria for providing funds, not just in this area, but in regional development areas. The creation of conditions for this purpose will also ensure that taxpayers' funds are used in an efficient manner that avoids massive social and environmental costs in the future. Surely that is what good government is all about. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a couple of comments about this report which I have only just recently seen. I cannot help but agree with Senator Tambling about the general execution of this program. Things do seem to be delayed. There seems to have been a lot of talk and a lot of fanfare, but very, very little action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a couple of the particular projects in the part of Queensland in which I live. One is the better cities program in relation to south Townsville. I should, of course, indicate at this stage that I have an interest in that program, in that I have a small ownership interest in property that will benefit from this program in the south Townsville area. I make that clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The project proposed is not a bad one, but it does relieve the Townsville City Council of many of the works and jobs that it should be doing out of its normal revenue. One of the main elements of the strategy was to improve sewerage and stormwater drainage in this south Townsville area. That is an area which the Townsville City Council had neglected for many, many years. It had neglected it because in local political terms it was always a safe Labor area. With the Townsville City Council being run by the Labor Party at the present time, and the state seat of south Townsville being held by the Labor Party as a fairly safe seat, the Labor Party has simply taken those areas for granted over a long number of years, and has ignored sewerage and drainage systems in that area&mdash;and roadworks&mdash;and has just let them run down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This system came along, as Senator Tambling pointed out, in 1992 in the run-up to the March 1993 election. It was announced with a lot of fanfare, everyone was taking credit for it; but there has been very, very little action since that time. Having got over the federal election, the Labor Party again skilfully used that project in south Townsville as a re-run for the recent city council elections in Townsville where the Labor Party was facing a very determined challenge and kept using this proposal for south Townsville&mdash;the better cities money, federal money&mdash;as some sort of fillip on how good it was at managing the city. The truth is quite the contrary. Its management of the city is very poor and its participation in this project is typical of the way the Townsville City Council operates; fairly slow, not much action. We can only wonder whether the money that has been spent has been properly spent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mackay Urban Consolidation Project is another one which was a good idea and it is being executed well. That was in an area being organised by the Mackay City Council and the then Pioneer Shire Council, since amalgamated, but both very efficient and good councils. One often wondered why they got the nod and got some money. However, we must realise that the electorate of Dawson centres on Mackay and was one of those seats that the Labor Party desperately wanted to win in the 1990 election. It threw a lot of money and effort into Dawson, and threw in this sort of project; but to no avail. The seat was retained by my friend and colleague Mr Braithwaite, and the Labor Party was again defeated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot help thinking that this was simply an attempt to buy votes in that area. Notwithstanding that, the project is a good one and it is moving along. In talking about the political overtones of this project, I highlight the fact that Rockhampton desperately needs this sort of funding to upgrade its sewerage system. The council made a very good submission for funds which was completely ignored. One cannot understand why Townsville&mdash;a fairly marginal federal seat, one that the Labor Party had to prop up&mdash;was favoured, and not Rockhampton in the seat of Capricornia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to look at the figures. The Labor Party thought Capricornia was a safe Labor seat before the election. As it turned out, it was not so safe after all. It turned out to be fairly marginal, thanks to a magnificent effort by the Liberal and National party candidates there. Because Rockhampton was thought to be in a safe Labor seat it did not get anything. The Rockhampton City Council, which desperately needed this sort of federal funding for the sewerage works that are very necessary in that city, went begging because the Labor Party was not interested in those areas.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>It is an unhappy coincidence that this document has reached us on this day&mdash;a day on which we have spent a considerable amount of time speaking about the poor operation of the higher education contribution scheme. That is what this document is about; it is the eighth report of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training on the operation of section 14 of the Employment, Education and Training Act 1988 and the higher education contribution scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what we heard today during debate on another bill before the Senate, one would think there was a great need to alter the higher education contribution scheme. That is what the government was proposing and the coalition agreed&mdash;that things were not so rosy in that particular area of legislation and government operation and great changes were necessary. But if we turn to page 7 of this report we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was general agreement among council members and institutions that there has been an incremental improvement in the understanding and operation of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA>One would imagine from that that everything is going along fine and that the status quo should continue. But no; what we had here today was further evidence of the attitude which was introduced when changes were announced in the 1993-94 budget. Page 7 of the report lists what those proposed changes were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first was an increase to 1 1/2 times the standard rate of HECS for students taking more than the minimum load for a course, plus the equivalent of one semester's load to complete their courses. The second change announced in the 1993-94 budget was for double HECS for undergraduate students undertaking a second or subsequent qualification at the same level or above. Honourable senators will recall the uproar that greeted those announcements. We read in the report a short paragraph describing what happened, and it is characterised in this way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government eventually dropped the first of these charges as part of the budget negotiations.</PARA>
<PARA>It then reports:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposal to charge double HECS to certain categories of students was not supported in parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>In no way does it say that the fallacy of these plans was revealed to the government which finally accepted the stupidity of the proposition. It puts it in a very neutral way, saying that it was not supported in parliament. We cannot blame a report for that because it probably would not use the value-laden terms that I just used, but that is how it happened&mdash;the proposition was revealed for its stupidity. The problem is that on page 8 we see a description of the 1993 changes to HECS characterised another way, and it is this that I want to address. The language is misleading because at the end of the paragraph about the impact of the 1993 changes to HECS, we read:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, as neither of these changes was eventually put in place, the council feels that most of those concerns have been assuaged.</PARA>
<PARA>They were the concerns that were expressed by students, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, and many others who are interested in education in Australia. Those concerns have not been assuaged because today we saw a continuation of the attitude that our students are seen as a source of funds for the government and that the government is justified in changing agreed principles and established arrangements to rake in more money from students, without regard to the arrangements that have already been made. These are real people who make plans for their lives, and we saw evidence today of the concerns that people have about the government's attitude. Those concerns should not be assuaged, they should be re-stoked, re-established and re-emphasised. I suggest that anybody who reads this report should not be misled by the language used in it, but should be warned by it. </PARA>

I am pleased to see Senator Collins here tonight because he and I jointly attended the opening of the last stage of the freeway. The Senate will recall that at the time we made some dire predictions about the effect of the completion of this freeway on local road programs nearby because it had not been taken through to the obvious point of joining with the New England Highway and finished instead eight kilometres short in a swamp just west of Minmi.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The freeway has had an absolutely disastrous effect on local traffic conditions.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="O15">Senator TIERNEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, and it is a great pity that the road that I have to travel on has not been properly upgraded, either. Where that freeway joins a local road, we are very much still in the horse and buggy age. The RTA carried out an impact study in December 1993 and estimated that 12,000 vehicles per day would use this road&mdash;a 49 per cent rise in the volume of traffic along Lenaghans Drive. Residents near Lenaghans Drive opposed this plan at the time and appealed to the minister for an alternative route because of safety and environmental concerns. The residents really had cause for concern and since the opening of the F3 freeway and its link to Lenaghans Drive their worst fears have been realised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RTA carried out a survey more recently and it proved that, since the opening of the expressway, traffic volumes were far higher than originally calculated during the EIS. Traffic along Lenaghans Drive has not increased by 49 per cent as forecast but by 100 per cent and is now at 15,316 vehicles per day. Heavy traffic was originally calculated to rise by 10 per cent and in February it had gone up by 20 per cent. Those figures were published in February this year, and I am comparing them with the September 1992 figure for heavy traffic volumes. Residents have reported being intimidated by heavy vehicles in this area, by the use of turning lanes as overtaking lanes and dangerous behaviour at roundabouts. The RTA noise survey shows that seven out of the 16 sites had far higher than predicted noise levels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stage 3 of the F3 freeway extension was to commence in roughly 10 years time when, according to the surveys or the estimates of the department, traffic volumes would have reached 15,000 vehicles per day. Already it is higher than that, and the figure I quoted earlier is higher than 15,000 a day. So if we are up to the point where stage 3 is needed 10 years early, we ask the government: where are the plans to start stage 3?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a news release here from the honourable Laurie Brereton which is talking about future road funding in New South Wales and across Australia, and I look in vain through the list for the proper completion of the F3 freeway or any feasibility study to provide the proper link from the end of the F3 to the New England Highway, and therefore to the Pacific Highway. I would urge the government to move quickly on this matter. We cannot afford to wait 10 years. The traffic volumes are there now, and growing, and there is considerable danger to people in the local area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is so much traffic congestion around the area now because of local roads that the local authorities are going to spend many millions of dollars creating a new road so that the local traffic does not have to go anywhere near the highway. This would not have happened if there was proper planning at the start. For years we had a situation where traffic west of Toronto was in chaos when the F3 freeway ended there. The fact that it was going to do the same thing west of Minmi, 13 kilometres on, could have been foreseen 10 years ago. The government should have planned properly for this and it should have in place the proper completion of the F3 freeway, which would provide a road service of high class, dual carriageway running from Sydney through the New England Highway and on to the Pacific Highway, thereby completing proper traffic connections into northern New South Wales and to Brisbane. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to make some brief comments on the report by the parliamentary Joint Committee on Public Works relating to the further development of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> on Garden Island in Western Australia. At the outset I would like to express my concern at the lack of proper process in relation to consideration of the proposed development. The fact that so many community and conservation groups managed to provide submissions to the parliamentary committee on public works is more than an indication of the commitment of those groups than of the time allowed by the committee for community groups to provide submissions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, and of greater concern, is the fact that the navy admitted to the committee that it had commenced preliminary work on some of the facilities. This displays a remarkable arrogance and a disregard for the proper review process that should be pursued for development proposals such as that at Garden Island. I am reminded of the comment made by Senator Ray during the estimates committee hearings. He said, `Why should I need to consult the community for something that Defence needs to do?'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of great concern is the apparent duplication of facilities that are inherent in the development proposal for Garden Island. It is pleasing to see that the committee has acknowledged this in its recommendation No. 4, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has yet to be convinced that a need exists for a small arms range at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA>I trust that the navy takes note of this comment and eliminates any plans for the small arms range on this island. Finally, I would like to express my concern that the environmental and cultural concerns outlined in the various submissions have not been properly considered. The four species of fauna which are rare and vulnerable, that is the Tamar wallaby, the carpet python, the lion skink and the brush bronze wing, require maintenance of habitat integrity. In addition, there is a particular need to protect the Rottnest Island pine forest and the cheesewood forest on the island. In that context I am concerned that assurances from the Department of Defence concerning environmental management are insufficient and require scrutiny by independent experts in ecosystem management. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Starcke Gold Pty Ltd is recorded as having spent $30,430 on exploration costs between 31 March 1992 and 28 February 1994.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Starcke Gold Pty Ltd is an Australian-registered company under the Corporations Law of Queensland incorporated in 1991.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) On 28 February 1994, one month before the expiry of Exploration Permit for Minerals (EPM) 8634, Starcke Gold Pty Ltd conditionally surrendered EPM 8634 in favour of an application for a new exploration permit (EPM 10035). This saw a sizeable part of the original permit surrendered, for a small additional area on the east where geochemical anomalies have been encountered. This additional area is still within the proposed Resources Reserve designed to encompass the potentially mineralised area. The Queensland Department of Minerals and Energy granted the permit, subject to the receipt of a security deposit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(a) No. The companies that enter into these arrangements place great store in honouring their agreements. They operate on a global basis and have global as well as domestic clients, including other governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The PfD scheme encourages the headquarters of companies to thoroughly explore opportunities for investment which make good commercial sense and which complement their global and regional strategies.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some have had more difficulty than others in identifying activities that make good commercial sense. For example, changes to the global structure of the industry have necessitated some changes to their corporate strategies and Partnership business plans. My Department has worked closely with these companies to ensure that the appropriate consideration is given to investing in commercially sustainable activities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this context, it is important to note that the Government provides no guarantees to Partners about levels of government business.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall the PfD Program is continuing to deliver very encouraging results and Partnerships firms remain committed to achieving the levels of activity they have volunteered under the terms of their agreements. Between 1988 and 1992, the Partner companies alone have delivered some $860 million in R&amp;D and $2.4 billion in exports between 1988 and 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that Partnership companies would be prepared to brief you on their activities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(b) The Department considers that the PfD Program does not contravene Australia's GATT obligations. The PfD Program does not involve any form of Government assistance to participating firms. The Program merely provides a framework for international and Australian companies to develop commercially sensible new products and services in Australia and win new export markets.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A January 1994 report by the GATT Secretariat on Australia's trade policy and practices noted that Australian officials have stressed that "policy implementation has remained free of any discrimination between participants and non-participants in PfD initiatives" and that the "authorities acknowledge that commercial realities may require changes in activities and strategic direction after signature of the Memorandum".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(c) No. I am not aware of any such advice and it is incorrect. Also, the companies have indicated that their participation with the Partnership Program is a good marketing tool and that the investments made in Australia have been beneficial to the corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)(d) No. Partnership companies report annually on their performance and are independently audited at least every 2 years by Ernst &amp; Young to validate the information. In the event of any company falling behind on its commitment, my Department works closely with the company to ensure that a program of strategic activities is established which will be sustainable over the longer term. Audit results to date have validated Partners' claimed performance.</PARA>
