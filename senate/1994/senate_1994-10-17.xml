<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is tomorrow's cultural statement intended to demonstrate the government's commitment to artists around Australia, many of whom are below the poverty line? If yes, does the government support today's announcement by the Australia Council of more than $2 million worth of grants to 11 elite artists, nine of whom reside in New South Wales and the other two in the Australian Capital Territory? In other words, not one red cent will go to any artist who does not live in the same state or territory as the Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pretty new theory of artistic merit that it is somehow geographically based. If Senator Alston cannot understand the difference between this kind of system and what it is designed to encourage and promote and some sort of strange, peculiar, perverse notion of equality of opportunity which he apparently wants to pursue, which is utterly out of kilter with the approach he adopts on these principles in every other context, he will not have too persuasive a story to sell. As I understand it, what these particular grants are about is to encourage the development of artistic excellence in the various areas which they are designed to pursue. Under those circumstances, judgments are made on that basis, and that basis alone.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I take it from that that the minister is perfectly content to endorse an outcome that basically says to the rest of Australia, `You haven't got any artists in any discipline who are good enough to get one of these elite handouts.' Perhaps the minister would like to explain what he understands to be the rationale and at the same time tell us why the government has been prepared to spend more than $10 million on these sorts of handouts to people who have already made it, who are already at the top of their own professions, without the need for any government handouts at all, when there are thousands of struggling artists around Australia who desperately need some assistance in order to enable them to emerge and come through. Why does he support this sort of very elitist concept?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The rationale for this particular program has been amply stated on innumerable occasions in the past by the Prime Minister. There is nothing new about these awards. Unlike many awards designed to encourage young artists, these are specifically designed to encourage and support people in mid-career, with an established track record in their particular artistic discipline&mdash;people whose income is very often very much less than Senator Alston might believe it is; certainly very much less than the income which he enjoys, even sitting where he is on the back bench, where he will permanently remain so far as his income is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is sitting on the front bench&mdash;it does not make any difference to his income; it only makes a difference if one is on this side of the chamber. He had better start planning another loan for the few years ahead because he will be there for a long while yet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These awards are designed to give further encouragement to and the further capability for people with an established track record&mdash;and, in most instances, an international reputation&mdash;to take their career another stage forward and to contribute in ways which we know they are capable of. That is the rationale. If those opposite had any sort of track record when it came to genuinely supporting the arts, not least those who are young and struggling, through the education system or anywhere else, Senator Alston might be a little more credible than he is at the moment, because he totally lacks it right now.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Trade. My question is prompted by the report of the APEC Pacific Business Forum which was released on Saturday. This report sets out a number of ambitious recommendations for trade and investment liberalisation among APEC economies, including a recommendation for an earlier timetable for free trade to be adopted at the leaders' meeting in November. I ask: what is the significance of these recommendations for the APEC agenda and specifically for the APEC leaders' meeting next month?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1762" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was a very important report which the APEC Pacific Business Forum presented to President Suharto on Saturday and which is now public in Australia. It is a ringing endorsement from the APEC business community for the objective of free trade in APEC by a meaningful date early in the next century. This is the direction that Australia very much wants to see APEC move in and, more importantly, it is the direction in which President Suharto, in his capacity as chair of APEC for this year, has made clear he wishes to see the organisation going.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report complements the report by the EPG which has already been discussed here in the Senate. As Senator Colston implies in his question, it sets the scene for an historic outcome from the APEC leaders' meeting in Bogor, an outcome which, if achieved, would contribute significantly to raising living standards in the region and providing a stable and certain future in the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major recommendation of the Pacific Business Forum report calls on APEC leaders to launch a process leading to free trade in the region by the year 2010, which is even more ambitious than EPG&mdash;in fact, very ambitious. But the significant thing to note is that the recommendation was adopted unanimously by business representatives in the forum from every APEC economy. There has been some debate about this country or that economy, and whether the people support this ambitious objective, but business representatives from every economy that is a member of APEC unanimously endorsed these recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It will go to the leaders' meeting in Bogor. It springs from the commitment from the Blake Island summit, and it is, I think, important as a way of maintaining pressure on governments to keep abreast of the rapidly changing commercial environment in the APEC region. We sometimes think we are setting very ambitious agendas, but the business reality sometimes passes what we think is ambitious and sets an even faster pace.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian government very much welcomes the report of the Pacific Business Forum. It is a valuable document to contribute to the discussion by APEC leaders at Bogor. It will provide a very strong commercial underpinning for those deliberations. It also has a range of very useful ideas it has drawn to help shape APEC's future beyond the question of trade and investment liberalisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One idea I want to draw the attention of the Senate to briefly is the proposal to call for leaders in Bogor to make a commitment to an immediate standstill on all new measures which obstruct trade amongst APEC economies. If the leaders were to commit to such a standstill&mdash;and it is not a simple concept; it needs a lot of discussion and consideration about its final form&mdash;it would provide an immediate and practical reassurance to the APEC business community of the stability and predictability of the trade and investment environment in which they operate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report shows a significant convergence of views within the region. It is encouraging for Australia because it is a convergence consistent with the direction in which we would like to see APEC go. I think we recognise the very important contribution business can make to APEC, and APEC will be successful only if it improves the environment for business people so that they can combine to enhance living standards in the region. So this is a very welcome report. It has potential to do a lot for people living throughout the region. On behalf of the Australian government, I would like to thank Australia's representatives on that APEC Pacific Business Forum, Imelda Roche and Philip Brass, for their outstanding contribution on this very important issue.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the reported disagreement between the government and its advisers in relation to the government's budget deficit strategy and I ask: is it not a fact that an increase in official interest rates, and therefore home mortgage rates, is inevitable between now and Christmas? Is it not a fact that impending mortgage rate increases could have been avoided if the government had brought down a much lower budget deficit for this financial year? Is it not a fact that the Governor of the Reserve Bank and the Secretary to the Treasury have been urging either a further lowering of the deficit or higher interest rates for a number of months now?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the first question is no; to the second question, no; and, to the third question, I have not seen their advice but I know that from time to time advisers to the government give opinions as to what the level of the macro-economic setting should be. Of course, the government makes decisions taking on board their views and the other obligations that a government has to the wider community. That is what we did in the last budget, and that budget has proved to be an appropriate and a fitting one for Australia, and I think we are seeing the results of that on all fronts.</PARA></TALK.START>

When the inevitable interest rate rises occur will the government agree to make public the minutes of the meetings of the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer, as is now done in the United Kingdom and in the United States, so that Australians will be in a position to judge the extent to which the government accepts independent advice and the extent to which it allows political considerations to drive interest rates?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It went up by three-quarters of one per cent. The reason why that change was made is that the government is in a position of managing a strong recovery in this economy. In order to do so, one has to balance the pressures that could have led to higher inflation and higher costs against all the other pressures in the economy. At the time the adjustment was made it was hailed universally by all the economic commentators as a responsible and appropriate adjustment. I do not have to apologise to anyone&mdash;I certainly do not have to answer Senator Gibson's question in any apologetic manner, and I will not&mdash;because we are in the business of managing an economy which on all sides we can clearly see has been successful. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology. I am aware that the minister opened Australia's investment office in Singapore last week. Could the minister advise why Singapore was chosen as the location for this office and what are the objectives both for the office and the government's investment promotion program in general?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Chris Evans for his question. Last Wednesday I had the pleasure of opening an investment office in Singapore&mdash;an investment office which will fall under the umbrella of Austrade, but which nonetheless will provide not only for Australians seeking information about investment in Singapore but also, in the wider ASEAN area, a means for that information to be funnelled back to Australia. Importantly, the office will allow investors in Singapore and in the wider ASEAN area who are seeking investment opportunities in Australia to be informed about the strength of the Australian economy and the growth in investment prospects in this part of the world. It will underpin this government's strategy on two-way investment which will bind Australia and the region more closely together.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The person to head up this office is Mr Mark See, a Singaporean by birth, who has had long experience in merchant banking throughout South-East Asia. He has latterly been an academic lecturing on international financial relations at Murdoch University in Western Australia. He is ideally suited to carry out the role that this office will require of him and be the person who will bind together investment intentions within the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Singapore is an important point for Australia to establish a high-profile position for an investment officer to attract investment to the region. Singaporean investment has been flowing into Australia. However, it has been related too narrowly, in my view, to real estate and housing, with some investment in resort and tourism. But I do think there are signs&mdash;and, indeed, during my short stay in Singapore, there were a number of interesting overtures made&mdash;of potential investment across a wider base in Australia in the manufacturing sector and in the services sector.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's white paper, Working Nation, set up a series of investment posts throughout the world so that Australia's economic profile as a source of high-level investment could be raised and begin to attract that investment from overseas and so that Australian investors could have access to overseas markets. We have put in place a number of other investment offices and, in addition to Singapore, we have posts in Hong Kong and New York. Others will be opened in the region shortly. In addition to that, the former Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, acts as a special investment representative for this nation and has been recently doing high-level work in Europe and in the United States which performs for us an essential link in bringing together investment opportunities with investment prospects here.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1993 the Australian Bureau of Statistics showed that Singapore had a stock of investment in Australia worth $6 billion and that our investment in Singapore was around $2 billion. With the opening of this new office, both those  relationships are set to get better.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Minister Crean said on national television yesterday that any further savings on unemployment programs should be spent on reducing the deficit, rather than helping the 830,000 unemployed Australians. I ask: is it not enough that this government has chosen to reduce spending on employment-related programs by $3 billion in real terms over the next three years? Is that not enough of a contribution from the unemployed? Why is the government unwilling to take heed of Vince FitzGerald's call to look at both the expenditure and revenue sides of the budget? Is Minister Crean really saying that the unemployed should be the focus of the deficit reduction strategy of this government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the two questions fired at me in this question time&mdash;one from the opposition and now one from the Democrats&mdash;I can say that we have both perspectives on the economic debate in Australia. I thank both honourable senators for their advice, but the government will nonetheless manage the economy as it has been doing quite successfully. There is no intention of doing anything other than providing a stable and sustainable future for jobs growth in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Working Nation statement, which we released in May of this year, the government committed for expenditure something like $10 billion over the next four years to provide long-term unemployed people with re-entry to the labour force and with a possibility of their obtaining longer and more sustainable employment. It is and will remain a successful policy. As a policy goes, it is probably one of the leading policies in the Western world to deal with the intractable problem of the longer term unemployed and, as a Labor government, we make no apologies for spending that extra money to create that employment opportunity and to promote job growth.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can see by resorting to statistics in the most recent publications of jobs growth in Australia that the economy is recovering, that jobs growth is growing quite strongly and that the policies we have set in train are working. In that context, I understand that Mr Crean was invited to answer a question on television about the deficit. He expressed a view which, I might say, is reasonably widely held in government. It is a view that, as I understand what he said, he will express and act on in the proper forums of government. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no possibility, as the opposition keeps raising, of there being some sort of interim budget or other refocusing of the economy. We will deal with those issues in the forthcoming budget. I understand those are entirely the comments that Mr Crean made, which are consistent with the comments that have been made by the Treasurer.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are, because that report was about national savings and any reduction in the budget deficit would contribute to the growth in national savings and the growth of investment capital in Australia for Australian industry. That is one of the things, I am sure, that Mr Crean had in mind. We are not asking the unemployed to contribute because, as I said, the program that we introduced in Working Nation is, in terms of outlays, a $10 billion boost to employment programs in this country over the next four years. Therefore, the opposition and the Democrats should simply stop trying to poke holes in what is a strong economy creating more employment for Australians. Rather, they should get behind the move to increase economic growth and spread the advantages more widely in the community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Australia condemns terrorism in whatever form it occurs. We are appalled at the kidnapping and murder of the young Israeli soldier, Corporal Waxman, by members of Izzedine al-Qassam, the military wing of the Islamic extremist group Hamas. The murder of Corporal Waxman, which was carried out in cold blood by his captors, is a repugnant act which I know will receive the unreserved condemnation of everyone in this chamber not only because of its cowardly and criminal nature but also because it was, of course, deliberately aimed at reversing the remarkable advances towards peace which have been achieved by Israeli and PLO representatives at the negotiating table.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can well understand that emotions are running very high in Israel in the wake of what has happened but it is all the more encouraging that in these circumstances the Israeli government has committed itself to resuming negotiations with the PLO. Those who would seek to destroy the peace process must not be permitted to achieve their aims through acts of violence designed to break down the spirit of moderation and compromise. The peace process obviously remains the only means of guaranteeing a secure, prosperous and fair environment for all the people of the Middle East&mdash;one in which we hope all terrorist incidents will be a thing of the past.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be said very clearly that the PLO bears no responsibility whatsoever, clearly, for this tragic episode. The victim was kidnapped on Israeli territory and held in a West Bank town well outside the jurisdiction of the Palestinian Authority at all stages. Of course, the more that the PLO can do to discourage extremist elements from performing acts of violence against Israeli targets the better for the peace process; but it is clear that the PLO cannot be held accountable for elements outside its ranks and influence.</PARA>

My department is currently investigating the condition of the Kerr block and also adjacent forest blocks in order to determine the likely consequences of any logging operations there on the recovery of the chuditch. I will report back to Senator Chamarette on the outcomes of that investigation in the near future. It is a condition of the 1994 woodchip export licences that the exporter ensures that operations approved under the licence do not endanger or threaten species.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Welcome back, Mr President. My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and involves a matter of principle relating to ministerial declarations of interest. As ministers are required under cabinet rules to report to the Prime Minister the amount of assets or liabilities they acquire to ensure there is no potential for unrevealed conflicts of interest, does he support the principle that, because Mr Keating can report only to himself about any such acquisitions, he should not enter into any new significant risk taking commercial venture while in office? As Mr Keating's decision to purchase a $2.2 million mansion in Woollahra is, according to the minister, in order to lease it out and receive a tax benefit, so exposing himself to a large commercial risk exceeding $1 million, I ask: what checks, if any, are in place to ensure Mr Keating reports any potential conflict of interest that may emerge from his business activities? To whom does he report, or is he not answerable to anyone?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Quite apart from anything else, the question is based on a completely false premise. There is no question about this particular investment being in the nature of a risk taking commercial venture operation. For Senator Baume to say that I have gone on record as saying that the purpose of this particular investment was to lease it out and receive a tax benefit from it is one of the more comprehensive whoppers even he has ever been guilty of in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Baume cannot find a single line that I have said anywhere which would remotely give rise to that interpretation. When I was asked across the chamber how this thing might be affordable in this kind of environment, given the order of magnitude of the investment involved, without even beginning to take into account considerations like the return on the property that Mr Keating already has and which he will, no doubt, sell as part of this particular transaction&mdash;without going into any of that, I said it should be taken into account that properties of this kind do have a very high rental value and, on any view, that would make a pretty significant dint into any particular interest commitment that anyone got into.</PARA>

In those circumstances, Mr Keating is engaged in nothing more than all the rest of us have been engaged in throughout our adult lives when buying houses for our families and, as the occasion has arisen, upgrading that housing. Many of us, including me, were lucky enough to ride a housing price boom in this respect. I do not know whether Senator Baume was, and I am not in the slightest bit interested. Nor should anybody else be interested in the details of this, which simply do not bear upon Mr Keating's role in public life. It is once again a grubby, sleazy attempt by Senator Baume to get his head down in the muck barrel, again with his little legs waggling up in the air, his snout down in the slime trying to find something to throw.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Zakharov, who has had a long interest in training matters, for her question. There are 14 information technology centres, ITECs, across Australia which are run by community-based sponsor organisations. They are designed to enhance the practical experience that long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged job seekers have of information technology. Also, access to ITEC facilities is available to small businesses on a cost recovery basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government provides up to 50 per cent of an ITEC's annual operating cost and the balance is met from industry, community contributions and income generated by the centre. In 1994 ITECs will receive $5 1/2 million under the skillshare program, one of the government's most successful labour market programs. Skillshare is delivered by community-based organisations and aimed at assisting long-term unemployed and other disadvantaged people to obtain jobs or to go on to further education training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Skillshare has assisted more than 400,000 people nationally through vocationally oriented skills training and self-employment enterprise based activities. In 1994, 44 per cent of skillshare participants have been successful in achieving some form of employment, further education or training.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brisbane ITEC, which was officially opened last week, is sponsored by the Catholic Archdiocese of Brisbane. The centre will receive $176,000 in 1994 for the establishment of premises in the Brisbane central business district, the purchasing of equipment and the provision of training. During the remainder of this year it will provide structured skills training to 100 participants with a focus on areas such as PC maintenance, open learning and bookkeeping.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ITEC concept is yet another initiative under this government that has proved to be very successful. In 1993 ITECs assisted nearly 5,000 participants nationally and they are well on the way to achieving the 1994 target of more than 5,000. During the first six months of this year 48 per cent of ITEC participants have been successful in obtaining unsubsidised employment on non-DEET funded education or training. This program, as part of the government's commitment in Working Nation to help the long-term unemployed, has been very successful. This, coupled with the excellent employment figures that came down last week of another 75,000 new jobs in Australia in September, shows that people have an opportunity to get jobs in the private sector market with, above all else, the government's well-targeted labour assistance programs such as ITECs and skillshare.</PARA>

Of course we know there is concern by growers and manufacturers. We have also had discussions with the Queensland state government, which has made some proposals about this. The replacement of non-tariff measures such as local content schemes with tariff quotas is an important part of the Uruguay Round agreement.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to win in some places, we cannot avoid the consequences for ourselves. We have to look at how we accommodate them. The conversion of the local content scheme to tariff only protection had already been announced by the government in November 1988. The effect of the Uruguay Round outcome is to bring the action forward by some months, from September to an earlier date&mdash;either 1 January or 1 July next year. We will be continuing to consult with the industry about what should be done as a consequence. I accept that the industry has legitimate concerns. As I have said, they are not all caused by changes the government is making. They are significantly influenced by the very desirable&mdash;in my view&mdash;change in consumption patterns of their product. Nevertheless, some of the outcomes are caused by decisions implemented by the government to the benefit of Australia as a whole. In the light of that and the Industry Commission report, we will be continuing to consult with the industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement made on 7 October is the second time this year that Canada has had to modify its 1994 import regime to ensure that its processors have sufficient supplies. Ensuring that Australian beef exports secure better access to the Canadian market is a very high priority for the government, and we will continue to pursue it. It is very hard to understand why a government would have a policy that says its consumers cannot have good beef at low prices and its processors cannot be competitive because they cannot get access to the product, but this is the policy of the Canadian government, and we continue to make representations to seek to change it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to underestimate the extent to which we appreciate the change that has been made. It will be better for the rest of this year for Australian beef exporters. It will open up a market, and I am very confident that we will win a fair share of it. But the bottom line is that the Canadian government must act to roll back its beef import restrictions against fair trading nations such as Australia. We are not asking the Canadians to give us a handout or to give us some special assistance or to do us a favour. All we are asking them to do is to recognise their own self-interest, the self-interest of their consumers and their processors, and to act accordingly. Australia will then take its chances on succeeding in the international marketplace in beef where I think we will win.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans), to a question without notice asked by Senator Michael Baume this day, relating to investments of the Prime Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I thought I asked a fairly simple sort of question that basically related to the fact that ministers of the Crown are obliged to reveal to their Prime Minister when they undertake any liabilities or acquire any assets. The cabinet rules state that they must reveal this in terms of the actual amounts of money involved. They cannot just say, `I bought a piggery' or `I intend to buy a piggery at some stage.' They have to actually reveal the details to the Prime Minister. I might say in passing that at no stage were such details ever revealed to Prime Minister Hawke when Treasurer Keating bought his piggery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps that is an indication of why there is no feeling that Mr Keating need to report to anybody. He is accountable to nobody in the present matter. If it were one of his ministers who had acquired this $2.2 million investment property, then that minister would have been obliged to reveal to his Prime Minister the amount of exposure he had to risk&mdash;in other words, the volume of borrowings&mdash;so that the Prime Minister could be aware of any otherwise unknown potential for any conflict of interest. That is a simple principle, but whom does the Prime Minister report to when he is involved in the purchase of an investment property?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard the most incredible weasel words from Senator Gareth Evans today about whether or not this was an investment property. He very selectively quoted from two lines of his answer instead of quoting from the rest of it. Apparently he is at last getting a copy of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to see what he really said. I am so glad he is, because he will see what he said. I will help him; it is on page 1296. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . in the present environment, the Prime Minister will have no hesitation whatsoever in entering into a very long lease indeed in order to lease out that particular property and derive a sufficient income . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The interesting thing there is that I suppose we should take no notice of what Senator Evans volunteers in this place because it is not a matter of substance. He manages to recall lots of things, except important things, and he obviously failed to recall this little bit. It seems to me that here we have evidence from Senator Evans that `he imagines' that the Prime Minister had no hesitation whatsoever. One would presume he would not dare make such a response without prior consultation with the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In any event, the Prime Minister's own evidence in the other place last week was that he had no intention of living in Woollahra for as long as possible and that his address, which he hoped to maintain, was 2603. By the way, I think he has got the postcode wrong, but that does not surprise me. The fact is that the Prime Minister himself has conceded that he will not be living in that Woollahra property. His principal place of residence, as he wishes, will be in Canberra at the Lodge, and he made a lot of fun, song and dance about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the facts are simply these. Here is the Prime Minister going into a commercial venture where, according to Senator Evans, he will have no hesitation whatsoever in entering into a very long lease. He exposes himself to commercial risk. If it were one of his ministers, the minister would have to reveal that to the Prime Minister. Who does the Prime Minister reveal his exposure to? He reveals it to himself, and it is probably not a pretty sight!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that Prime Ministers do not enter into this kind of commercial venture for this very reason. The only people they can properly report to after they have been elected, because the people did not know they had this exposure beforehand, would be the Australian people who elected them. That is why Prime Ministers generally do not enter into this kind of venture. If they do, they must report it properly to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this Prime Minister is accountable to nobody. He believes he can break conventions such as this. He believes he can enter new commercial risk taking operations without being accountable to anybody. The Australian people are entitled to know about this. If this Prime Minister determines to break this sort of tradition, he should properly expose all his risk. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The outrage from the Federal Opposition and sections of the media about the Prime Minister, Mr Keating's purchase of a $2.2 million residence is misplaced. Mr Keating has simply done what many people do or hope to do&mdash;traded upmarket in the interests of his family's comfort and economic security. </PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what Mr Keating has done. When the opportunity arose to get, within a kilometre or so of the property that he already has in Sydney, a better property from the point of view of his family, a property that is better constructed and better laid out for his family as they get older&mdash;in particular, with a little flat out the back, which he is anticipating will be used by his son, who is not a kid any longer and is now approaching a reasonable age of maturity&mdash;the Prime Minister grabbed that opportunity with both hands, and it is entirely appropriate that he should do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to reveal all the circumstances of Mr Keating's financial arrangements as I know them.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Senator Baume began his question today, premised as it was on this notion of commercial risk in a commercial investment, he purported to quote me as having gone on record as saying that Mr Keating was doing this in order to derive a tax advantage from it. What I said began and ended with the paragraph on page 1296 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> to which he referred, and I will read it into the record. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I simply make one obvious point, which even Senator Baume should appreciate, and that is that a particular property of this kind has a very high rental value indeed&mdash;an extremely high rental value&mdash;and, as such, sufficient, I would imagine, to service whatever size mortgage was necessary to enable a purchase of this kind to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA>I said nothing about tax advantages but simply about the income flow, the income stream, from a transaction of this kind. In view of the present political environment, which is guaranteed to grant almost permanent tenure to the Prime Minister for as long as he would wish to remain living in the Lodge in Canberra, I went on to make this point:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I further imagine that, in the present environment, the Prime Minister will have no hesitation whatsoever in entering into a very long lease indeed in order to lease out that particular property and derive a sufficient income from it.</PARA>
<PARA>I was simply making the point that it is far easier to find a tenant when one is entering into a lease for a period of more than 12 months than it is when entering into a lease for a period of less than 12 months, such as for three months or six months at a time. I am simply making the point that in the political environment, contributed to by Senator Baume's incompetence, it is a pretty reasonable environment in which Mr Keating could quite confidently settle for at least the next four years&mdash;in fact, until such time as the next term of parliament is over, which, I imagine, is the time span in which he and most normal mortals in his position would be reasonably thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the only point in issue there is deriving a sufficient income from it in order to cover whatever interest payments might be due on whatever sum of money it might be necessary to borrow in order to cover the gap that arises between whatever he realises on the sale of the existing property. Beyond that, it is absolutely none of Senator Baume's business. There is no evidence whatsoever about this particular transaction, there is nothing remotely colourable about this transaction, such as to justify the kind of fulminating indignation which Senator Baume has made peculiarly his own. On that particular matter, there is no basis for him to go skirmishing around the registration of interest to pursue that matter further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actual dollar sums that are attributed to particular investment transactions that ministers enter into is entirely a matter for in-house consideration and determination by our own government. It is not a matter for scrutiny by anyone other than the Prime Minister and it is not inappropriate under these circumstances, given the confidence that we all have in the Prime Minister, that the system should work in the way that it does here. There is nothing colourable about this transaction except Senator Baume's determination to get in the bottom of the barrel and throw some muck around in order to keep his perfect record intact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was an astonishing response that Senator Gareth Evans made to the points raised by Senator Baume. Senator Evans said that it was of no interest to anybody what particular transactions Mr Keating undertook. Yet the cabinet guidelines would require Senator Evans, if he wished to buy a large house in Holt for $2.2 million and had to borrow large sums of money, to inform Mr Keating of that transaction&mdash;the cost of the transaction, the borrowings that he made and who he borrowed that money from.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans has confirmed for Senator Baume that Mr Keating does not have to abide by those rules. Senator Evans said that he had sufficient confidence in Mr Keating that this matter was of no particular interest. Does Mr Keating have sufficient confidence in Senator Evans and his ministers? They are required to abide by certain rules when they make purchases, when they borrow, and when they sell things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with this Labor government is that there seems to be one set of rules for one group of people and another set of rules for another. I think Senator Baume raised a fair question today in relation to this matter of principle: where a very large transaction is involved, is Mr Keating required to be subject to the same rules as other ministers? The answer that Senator Evans gave us was that he is not. Whereas Senator Evans would have to declare his borrowings, assets and so forth, Mr Keating does not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then the issue was raised as to whether this was a commercial transaction. Senator Evans fulminated long and loud in question time and, as usual, had an unpleasant whack at the questioner. But it seems to me that a fair reading of the answer that he gave&mdash;which he, himself, read into the record&mdash;is that this is a commercial transaction.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Loosley shakes his head. Senator Loosley's experience in this area is not great and neither is his record. This is a commercial transaction and it raises the issue of taxation and negative gearing. Mr Keating has very large borrowings. He abolished negative gearing and then he brought it back.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put it to Senator Evans that he gave a very poor response to the issues that Senator Baume raised. There is an issue of principle of disclosure of conflict of interest. If Senator Evans had come into this chamber and said, `We will follow the practices of this government'&mdash;I do not know whether this would have been satisfactory, but he could at least have said it&mdash;`as we tell Mr Keating of our transactions so, on the other hand, does Mr Keating inform his cabinet of his transactions,' that would have been an answer of sorts. While it might not have been a satisfactory answer, at least it would have been an answer of sorts. But Senator Evans could not say that. All he could say was, `We have complete confidence in Mr Keating.' As for the second aspect, namely, whether this is a commercial transaction, I put it to Senator Evans that his answer last Monday, 10 October, and reconfirmed by him today in this chamber confirms the point that clearly this is a commercial transaction.</PARA>

<PARA>In noting the minister's comments regarding the international convention on climate change, we should recognise the emerging difference of opinion within the government regarding these sorts of international treaties. Last Thursday, I asked Senator Faulkner whether the government would delay its proposed signing of the international convention on desertification. Senator Faulkner dismissed my plea in that regard.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to Senator Gareth Evans in a moment. Senator Faulkner said that he did not give a damn about the coalition's inquiry. In my question I had referred to the committee of inquiry the coalition had established into the government's proposal to sign this treaty, and to the overwhelming response we had received by way of submissions from very significant community groups, including the Australian Mining Industry Council, the National Farmers Federation, state farmer bodies, local government authorities and many individual farmers, pastoralists and other interested community representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Faulkner said that he did not give a damn about any of that. He may not give a damn about those wide ranging and many submissions that were lodged with our Liberal and National parties committee of inquiry but, in contrast, foreign minister Evans, while confirming that the government would proceed to sign this convention over the past weekend, said that the government would consult widely before deciding whether to ratify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I make the point that that is a very significant change in the government's attitude to this matter. It is a major victory for the inquiry that was undertaken by the Liberal and National parties because, quite apart from the nature of the convention and the government's intention to sign it, the major issue that was raised with our committee in relation to this matter was the government's failure to consult sufficiently widely in the community before it made a decision to sign this convention and ratify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This lack of consultation was raised again and again in submissions to our inquiry. As I said, it is worth noting that Senator Evans has now said that, although the government has proceeded to sign the convention, before it proceeds to the next step&mdash;ratification&mdash;the government will consult widely. I notice that Senator Evans has included a bit of a fairy story in that statement because in his press release on Friday he said that this would be done consistent with the government's practice of widespread consultation. Of course it is nothing of the sort because the government does not consult on these issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have just said, one of the main complaints about the decision to sign the convention was the government's failure to consult sufficiently widely. Nevertheless, we have the recognition now with regard to ratification that the government intends to consult with relevant community groups, including industry and state governments. I welcome that and note that it is a direct result of the pressure that has been put on the government by this inquiry of the opposition parties. But mere consultation regarding the ratification of this convention is not enough because there are other issues of importance besides consultation. That consultation must bear fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD"></EMPHASIS><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First, unless state governments, relevant industry groups and other community groups involved in the process of consultation that the minister has promised agree to ratification, the government most definitely should not proceed to ratify this convention. Secondly, the community and certainly we in the opposition will not be satisfied until the government goes one step further and unequivocally rules out the use of the external affairs power via this convention to interfere in the land management decisions of state and local governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We recall that earlier this year when the then minister for the environment, former Senator Richardson, was questioned about it, he refused to rule out that possibility. He refused to rule out the possibility that the federal government, when it proceeded to sign this international convention on desertification, would in the future use that power to take control of land management from the states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must now make an unequivocal statement that it will rule out that abuse of the external affairs power. If the government ratifies this treaty community fears about the nature and intent of the government's signing of it will continue.

<PARA>I am grateful for the minister's answer&mdash;as far as it went. However, it was a little short on detail. He mentioned two conflicting opinions which were offered by the DPP.

<PARA>There is no doubt that the deficit that this economy labours under is a burning issue that needs to be dealt with. Clearly the August figures indicate that, rather than getting better, the situation is getting worse. In August we returned a figure of $2.1 billion&mdash;in other words, a $2,100 million deficit for the month of August. </PARA>

Whilst Australia is suffering from this problem, we have government ministers fighting amongst themselves as to the appropriate strategy for dealing with this burning question. Whilst the Australian economy is sinking, we have the spectre of government ministers arguing about how to rearrange the deck chairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This problem needs a proper assessment and has to be dealt with. But this government does not have the will, the capacity or the foresight to deal with the problem after its last attempt. Let me simply remind the Senate what the last attempt was. The last attempt to rein in this burgeoning current account deficit was to initiate the recession we had to have, in the words of the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. We had to have this recession to overcome our burgeoning current account deficit, our overseas debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We went through all the pain of that. We are now emerging from that recession and the simple question needs to be asked: has the current account deficit improved? The answer is no. Has our overseas debt improved? The answer is no. So we have gone through all of this pain for no benefit whatsoever. It is for that reason that the answer given by Senator Cook was so poor. What he told us was that the rate of unemployment is decreasing and economic activity is increasing. That is true, but from what benchmark? From the benchmark, from the low, that the Labor Party established as a result of its deliberate economic policy of creating this recession that we had to have. So its attempt to deal with the problem has been an absolutely dismal failure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, when people in this chamber ask questions about the government's deficit strategy&mdash;my colleague and friend Senator Gibson asked a question about it today; I asked a question about it today&mdash;we get pure invective from a minister who is unable to grasp the problem, deal with the problem or provide a solution to the problem.

Those opposite are absolutely humiliated because they had to get a commitment from John Langmore to ensure that the Aboriginal cultural artefacts were not exported en masse to Adelaide against the wishes of the community, who were not even consulted.</PARA></TALK.START>

The government did not do that when it came to creative fellowships. Those opposite will not dissociate themselves from the fellowships. They think it is a good idea for Rodney Hall to get three lots of $65,000 a year when he has just picked up a second Miles Franklin Award&mdash;and $25,000 goes with that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In one way we can understand why this matter of public importance was proposed today. It is the absolute last day on which a matter such as this could have been proposed and the debate reduced to negativism and point scoring, because tomorrow the cultural policy statement will be brought down. Anybody who wanted to have a substantial discussion about arts policy would have waited until tomorrow. People then may well criticise the statement. They may think it is a terrible statement. They may think there should have been twice as much money or that the money should have been spent somewhere else. That would have been a perfectly proper time to debate priorities in the arts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people choose to make their major statements on the arts the day before the policy comes down, we know that they do not want to discuss the substance. They want only to engage in point scoring and denigration. This is the last day on which such a matter of public importance could have been raised. Tomorrow we can have a debate about what the substance is and what the priorities are. We can have a debate then about the statements the government has made, many of which do not accord with the  assertions made by Senator Alston&mdash;and this is not something I will pre-announce today. Like his leader, the last thing that Senator Alston wants to do is talk about substance because there is no question of there not being a coherent, consistent approach to developing a policy; building on previous reforms for the next set of reforms; and having a consistent, coordinated approach to great issues of national significance, which I consider cultural policy to be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we had this fascination about arms-length funding. We have known in the past that Mr Downer used to be for arms-length funding; then he was against it. Then we were pleased to see that he was back supporting cultural funding again. The first time the opposition was put to the test&mdash;the first occasion that an arms-length funding decision was made after declaring how much it supports arms-length funding&mdash;it attacked the government for that decision and attacked the people who made the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not matter whether I agree or disagree. The Australia Council makes a lot of decisions: I agree with some and I disagree with others. When I was the arts minister, I never criticised any of them or endorsed others. I said, `I don't want to be the person to announce them. They are your decisions, whether I agree with them or not.' It is the case with this as well. We have to have a little consistency, principle, pattern and purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow's cultural policy statement will be an important statement. I very much welcome the fact that it is being brought down. But it is not a one-off statement. It cannot be seen as some sort of isolated statement&mdash;a fashion of the day. Suddenly arts have become a bit popular. Suddenly there is a bit of interest. The opposition says, `We had better make a statement about the arts; we had better try to dash in and get it out two weeks before the government, even if we haven't got anything to say.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is part of a systematic program. In the last election campaign the arts were not fashionable. We were there when the arts were not fashionable; when they were not the flavour of the month; when the opposition was criticising the amount of funding in the arts and proposing to cut it. We made a commitment. We put that forward in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS>, which was the most comprehensive arts policy ever presented in an election. We said that we would, in broad terms, do two things. One was a very long commitment, and I do not have time in this sort of debate to go through it all. Firstly, we said that we would pump some more money in straight away on a series of defined initiatives. Secondly, we said that we would bring down a major cultural policy statement. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS> budget commitments were honoured&mdash;every one&mdash;in the first budget. There was $331 million for the arts in that budget, honouring every spending commitment that was made in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow we will come to the question of the cultural policy statement, which was the other key element of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that we would develop a broader framework that would be the next stage of the development of cultural policy. No one statement is ever the end of the process of reform. There will be more that will need to be done in subsequent years. It will not be the end of the process; but it is an important next stage, an important enhancement. It will be a very substantial reform in a number of areas of administration and funding, making possible a whole range of new cultural activity for Australians. It is important to remember that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to contrast Senator Alston's unfortunate contribution. All that the honourable senator did was to try to assert that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has no interest in Australian culture because some of the things that he prefers are Australians doing better than anybody else what the rest of the world likes. Our Australian Opera went to the Edinburgh Festival and was considered sensational. It was extremely successful. Our Prime Minister arranged for a whole range of Australian arts to be on display last week in Washington. That promotion was an outstanding success for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unAustralian that the Prime Minister likes the Australian Opera's performance of Mozart and the Bell Shakespeare Company's Australian interpretations of Shakespeare.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct. Let us have a look at the principles that we think should underpin arts funding. I did not hear any statement about principles from Senator Alston&mdash;anything about what he thought the core issues were. Let me tell the Senate what I think they broadly are. Honourable senators can define these things in different ways at  different times, but I will give them a set of views that have been guiding us. There will be more articulation of this tomorrow in different words in the speeches of the Prime Minister and Mr Lee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, what do the funding initiatives in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS> budget package seek to do? They seek to encourage the production of the best that Australians are capable of producing and to fund the new, the risky, the cutting edge and the things that challenge the conventional wisdom. They do not always make people such as members of parliament comfortable. They get out there and do things that we might disapprove of. They say things that we do not agree with. They challenge the things we say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is one of the great roles of arts in a democracy. That is why we have arms-length funding and why we have to accept that decisions are sometimes made which we do not agree with. This does happen; the Australia Council makes such decisions. Key things are issued in ways that maybe I would not do, but they are done by honest Australians doing their best for the arts as they see it, and I respect and endorse their decisions. They are at least as valid as mine or Senator Alston's. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the funding initiatives allow maximum participation. One of the most unfair things that Senator Alston said in his criticism related to the question of the Sydney focus. One of the most significant changes that have taken place&mdash;not just since the election, because some were during the last term of the government; but, to generalise, let us talk about what has happened since that period&mdash;has been the enhanced access of Australians, wherever they live, to the best that Australian arts have to offer. This is done through the playing Australia, the performing arts touring program, the visions of Australia program, the visual arts touring, and there is more to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot, of course, announce it today. If Senator Alston had wanted this debate tomorrow, we could have discussed the substance of it. But I can tell him that there is more to come: getting the best that there is out to where people are so that the taxpayers who fund it in Alice Springs, Mount Isa and Darwin, wherever they live, can see the best that Australia has to offer; and allowing the maximum opportunity for individuals to participate, irrespective of their wealth, in developing their talent as best they can through enhancing arts training. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow we will announce something particular for Aboriginal and Islander arts training. I can say that because that builds on a commitment that I announced when I was arts minister, so it is not a `leak' of tomorrow's statement. The detail will be in that statement. The people who most need that assistance will be getting it, as was the case with the Australian Youth Orchestra when we set out to make sure that, wherever one lived or whatever one's income, one had an equal opportunity to participate if one had the talent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arts and culture is an industry that employs a lot of people. We aim to recognise it as an industry, to develop it as an industry and to develop its capacity to export. It is arguably one of our top 10 industries&mdash;one could get into a definitional debate and I am not interested in that today. However one defines it, it is a substantial industry, an industry that employs a lot of people, that generates a lot of wealth as well as providing a lot of pleasure, and it is developing an increasing capacity to export effectively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are providing more assistance as a result of previous budgets and the activities of Austrade to build on those exports. We will do more. The arts and culture industry has a tremendous capacity to project an image of Australia, first of all to ourselves, which in some ways is the most important, and also to the rest of the world. We will be doing more about that tomorrow also. If Senator Alston had wanted to debate the substance of that, he would have waited till tomorrow, until after the statement came down. We then could have talked about priorities and whether he liked the way we were doing it and whether we were putting enough money into it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is fascinating to watch honourable senators opposite&mdash;no wonder they like being in opposition; it gives them a certain comfort. On the one hand they can say, `Public spending should be less' but on the other hand they can then say, `Every area that I care about should have more spent on it.' Every shadow minister says that we do not spend enough, but the shadow finance minister says we spend too much. They cannot all be right. According to Senator Alston's matter of public importance&mdash;to which he did not actually refer in the sum total of his contribution&mdash;we have not substantially delivered the concrete action in support of the arts to match our rhetoric on the subject. But we have put the dollars there. Some people might say that we should put in more, but there is more than ever before. Funding was increased to $330 million in 1993-94, there was more again this time and there will be more again tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So in two budgets and less than two years of government there has been a big increase in the budget and there will be a cultural policy statement tomorrow. The dollars are there, the commitments in principle are there and are available across the range to Australians wherever they live, whatever their income, to enable them to participate and to have access to the best that Australians have to offer. This is part of a systematic program that we have developed to enhance our cultural industries, to give national support to what is one of Australia's largest industries occupying a very significant place in the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we were supporting the arts in developing a comprehensive policy for the arts in Australia when it was not fashionable. I am delighted that we have made it a bit fashionable, and so other people are seeking to jump on the bandwagon. Welcome aboard! It is not that I am concerned that people want to jump on the bandwagon. I wish they had been on it earlier; they are very welcome. Unfortunately, the only seats left are at the back because the rest of us have been on the bandwagon for a very long time. We are seeking to continue the momentum and, to the extent to which opposition senators want to join in, argue about the priorities and seek to have more funding and more commitments, they will be very welcome on board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But when we came down with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS> and made the commitments in the last election about the importance of the arts to Australia, did those opposite recognise that and say, `Yes, we agree also'? No! They tried to attack the Prime Minister. Somehow, because he was increasing the profile of the arts, they attacked him for denigrating the coal industry. I never did quite understand that point. Nevertheless, that was their response. They took one thing he said out of context. In no way did they say, `We will match that funding. We think those initiatives are worth while. We think the inspirational capacity of the arts&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But one sees the opposition's attitude expressed every time these creative fellowships are brought down. As soon as it is suggested that one Australian who has made an enormous contribution to the arts might get something remotely approaching, for a limited number of years, the salary that a backbencher gets, it is a scandal. Every year when the creative fellowships come down, opposition senators say, `These people are being made rich. This is outrageous!' Don Burrows has not made a sufficient contribution to Australia to be worth as much as Senator Patterson or Senator Alston!

However, the opposition has taken this pre-emptive action and it is in that context that we have to deal with it. We are arguing now across the chamber in the absence of the one document which could genuinely help us to assess the government's action in the arts area. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats do not dispute the suggestion that the federal government's rhetoric in the arts has, for much of the last decade, not been matched by any real commitment to the Australian arts community. We need look no further than the Labor government's record in funding the arts since it took office in 1983 to realise that the arts community in Australia has not fared well in this country since the mid-1970s. It goes back, indeed, before Labor actually came into government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is on the funding criteria that the Labor government begins to look rather poor in this arts area. For instance, Australia's primary arts funding body, the Australia Council, has had to endure some very substantial funding cuts since the mid-1980s under the guise of the economic recession. This has meant that very little money has been available for new arts initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is understandable that thousands of Australians who are involved in the arts begin to question this government's commitment to the arts when our premier arts organisation&mdash;the Australia Council&mdash;has been starved of funds.

These funding cutbacks have significantly affected all sections of the arts community in Australia, including most obviously our performing and dramatic arts, as well as visual and music creators. At a time when it is widely acknowledged that the Australian arts industry is one of this country's biggest industries and a credible export earner, we should be encouraging and fostering our export industries and not starving them of funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest Australian Bureau of Statistics reports on the arts reveal, for instance, that the various Australian arts industries create in the order of $13 billion worth of goods and services, making them roughly the same size as the banking industry and twice the size of our sheep industry. Against this background, the Democrats have consistently maintained at budget time over the years that the government was making a huge mistake in seeking to reduce outlays by cutting funding to the arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true&mdash;and the Democrats will acknowledge this&mdash;that last year's federal budget represented a reverse of this trend as far as the Australia Council is concerned, but this increase has come after years of neglect. The government will need to continue to make real funding increases. I was pleased to hear Senator McMullan mention the intention to further increase funding in succeeding years. The government will need to continue these funding increases to agencies such as the  Australia Council for many years to come if the damage over the last decade is to be repaired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result, if the government wants to avoid the accusation that it has engaged in nothing more than politically inspired rhetoric in the arts, it will need to deliver a cultural statement tomorrow that includes substantial spending and policy initiatives for a multitude of arts activities. This must include considerable funding initiatives, especially towards agencies such as the Australia Council, the Australian Film Commission and Ausmusic, and in the specific area of Aboriginal and multicultural arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In tomorrow's arts and cultural statement, the Democrats will also expect government action in providing genuine incentives to encourage corporate support for the arts sector. Essentially, the Australian Democrats will want to see measures that will prove that the government is serious about fostering the commitment to the creative growth of Australian artists and to the economic development of our nation's culturally related industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, this will require a sincere commitment by the government to the areas of arts infrastructure and creative development. In other words, if the government is to fulfil its promises to the arts community, there has to be the provision of specialist training facilities and opportunities for artists to develop their specialist skills. At the moment, these areas are seriously underprovided for, and their continued absence is severely limiting the potential of the arts community. The Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts is currently looking at education in the arts. Having looked at some of the submissions which have come in to that committee, I have found that there is a genuine and very consistent complaint about the matter of training in arts education. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is right across the board; not just in fine arts, but in the area of music, dance and visual arts. This will require action also in the important areas of strengthening Australian content guidelines. The Democrats have consistently advocated the need to increase Australian content in both broadcast and production levels. Australian content&mdash;particularly in television, whether free to air or emerging pay television&mdash;must be protected if we are to preserve and enhance our cultural heritage. Unless we can ensure an increased Australian emphasis in the areas of film, radio and television, Australia's very unique cultural identity will continue to be threatened.</PARA></TALK.START>

I draw attention to both the government's and the opposition's support for GATT and praise the French&mdash;and honourable senators will not often hear me praise the French, but on this occasion I will certainly praise them&mdash;for their stand in protecting their cultural activities from being overrun by massive and cheap American exports. This most recently negotiated GATT agreement could see the end of a number of countries' arts and cultural industries which are reliant on government involvement to ensure that a nation's unique identity is fostered and portrayed in the arts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another key related area which the government must address tomorrow is that relating to the future role of information superhighways in fostering Australian culture and creativity. It is already clear that our existing regulations system overseeing the Australian communications industries is inadequate, and unless the government acts now to address these problems, any promise or rhetoric that Australia will see a bright new age of diverse and accessible information flows will not be realised. The superhighways of the future could be an exciting springboard for cultural development, but only in a regulatory environment which promotes diversity, equitable access and creativity and not one that penalises them. </PARA>

In both these areas, the solutions for the government are quite simple.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition is representative of a bankrupt estate in terms of arts policy. Of course the coalition would choose Elizabeth Bay House to launch its so-called directions statement. The ideas in the statement were older than the building itself. If we are looking at the Labor government's strengths at the moment, arts is one of them in terms of policy, as we saw today and we will see again tomorrow, in terms of achievement&mdash;and I will say a bit more about this in a moment&mdash;and in terms of electoral support and endorsement. Obviously, this is what has caused the coalition to begin to be active at long last. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Alston was prepared to criticise the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for having an interest in Mahler. Before he proceeded to trash Rodney Hall, he trashed Mahler. But if we look at Senator Alston's own list of interests&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Forshaw for drawing specific attention to this in the adjournment debate the other night&mdash;we find that among his own interests he lists: English literature; films, particularly films with Woody Allen, an American film director; third-world arts; coptic crosses; Billy Joel, an American rock and roller; and Central Asian and Middle Eastern Carpets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before saying that Senator Alston ought to be rolled up in one of the carpets, where is the mention of David Malouf, Tom Keneally, Patrick White or Olga Masters? Where is the  mention of Bruce Beresford or Peter Weir? Where is the mention of Midnight Oil and Yothu Yindi? No wonder Senator Alston does not like Rodney Hall; he is too busy looking at the productions of artists from various parts of the world. His interests are bankrupt in terms of Australian comment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a rich field if we are looking at the coalition in terms of false and misleading statements. It says one thing, does another and then says the other thing. For example, at one time Mr Downer said, `There is a role for government in arts funding including, at the federal level, the Australia Council, but that funding should be at arms length.' Fair enough, honourable senators might think, but on other occasions he has said exactly the opposite. He said, `Labor has hidden behind the false and intellectually dishonest facade of arms-length funding.' If we look to the coalition's policy document now for some degree of clarity, we find that there is both. It is now committed to peer assessment and arms-length funding. It is an absolute potpourri in terms of any kind of policy output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is happy to stand on its record in these matters and to amplify them. I went to the awarding of the creative arts fellowships this morning&mdash;the Keatings, as they are popularly known in the industry&mdash;and a great many very talented, very able Australians were acknowledged by their peers. I agree with Senator McMullan that it is entirely appropriate over a period of three years to give people who are contributing in a splendid cultural way the simple backing of a backbencher. For a person like Rodney Hall, who has contributed a great trilogy to Australian literature, that is important in terms of guaranteeing the future, and I think the awards were thoroughly well deserved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also put into perspective, courtesy of the remarks of the Prime Minister, just where the government stands in respect of the arts. Earlier today he talked about the statement that Minister Lee will bring down tomorrow. He said that in the belief of the government the arts are not peripheral to Australian life but central to it. That is correct in terms of an acknowledgment, an undertaking and an obligation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it may be true that the coalition has arrived at one minute to midnight in terms of an arts policy, people cannot walk away from the realisation that the prime ministers in Australian politics who will be acknowledged as the great supporters of Australian arts, of legitimate Australian cultural endeavour, are Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating. I acknowledge John Gorton and Bob Hawke&mdash;there is no question about that&mdash;but the prime ministers who will be most closely associated with Australian creativity will be Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating, and for very good reasons: because of their personal interest and their preparedness to guide and craft policy. </PARA>

The history of the Liberal Party in the arts area, as well as the contribution that Mr Gorton made, has been a long and proud history. I will not go through all the things that were developed under Liberal governments, but many of the greatest arts institutions owe their beginnings to a Liberal government. So Senator Loosley should not perpetuate that myth that we have no concern about the arts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern the coalition is expressing now is with the way in which this government is directing the arts. Mr Keating mouths support for the arts, and he throws some crumbs from the emperor's table, but actions speak louder than words. What have been the emperor's actions? Let us look back, as Senator Alston did, to Mr Keating's election eve speech. He said, `We've had great support from the arts, and we have not done much for them. We will give them a kick along.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The price of having this kick along is quite high. The arts community, who are the interpreters, the shapers and those who depict our culture&mdash;they play many roles&mdash;ought to think about the emperor's culture and the culture of the tribe to which he belongs, the ALP. One aspect of the culture of that tribe is about mates' rates and jobs for the boys. Some of the girls get jobs&mdash;if one is Mary Crawford one does not get a job&mdash;but it is mainly about jobs for the boys and retribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen retribution, especially in the right wing of the ALP, to which Mr Keating belongs. If the right wing does not get its way, someone gets his face bashed in. That is the culture of the ALP. It is a culture of worshipping at the altar of political correctness. If the arts community gets too far into bed with the Labor Party, that is the culture to which it will be exposed: mates' rates, jobs for the boys and retribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The culture of the ALP ought to sound a warning bell to the arts community, and if it does not heed that warning bell, it will be hearing a death knell. We have only to read Paddy McGuinness. I do not always agree with Paddy McGuinness&mdash;I have known him since I was about 15&mdash;but in this case in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> on Saturday Paddy made a very powerful statement about what happens when we get the government or the state too closely involved in the arts. He talked about how we have seen that in communist states and he highlighted a book called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Velvet Prison</EMPHASIS>, written by a Hungarian writer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is impossible to read this book without being reminded of the way in which cultural policy operates under the present Australian Government and its instrument of cultural policy, the Australia Council.</PARA>
<PARA>So he is expressing some concerns. If we look through recent articles by arts journalists, we will begin to see concerns expressed about the direction in which the Labor Party is taking the arts community. For the Labor Party and its culture there is no such thing as a free lunch. If the arts community accepts Mr Keating's kick along, it has to understand there will be strings attached. It really should not allow itself to be sucked further and further into the ALP lair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arts community needs to stand up and not just lobby for funds, lobby to be noticed or lobby for its position, and rightfully its position, in our community as people who lead debate on issues and cultural ideas, but also demand that the government and whichever party is in power remain at arms length in principle and also in practice. That is not happening. We have advocated arms-length funding, but we can direct that arms-length funding by putting qualifications, guidelines and all sorts of constraints on funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the culture of Labor&mdash;I have mentioned what that culture is&mdash;intrudes into the relationship between the arts and the government, as it has begun to do in no uncertain terms, the arts community and the Australian community as a whole ought to be concerned. The warning is there. We have seen it happen in other countries where the state has become too involved in directing the arts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direction, as I said before, can come in subtle and not so subtle forms. We have seen what happens to arts groups who do not conform. Senator Alston reminded us of the Australiana Fund. It is a timely reminder. An excuse can be found to explain why one's services are no longer needed, why Australians do not now have an opportunity to see some of the works that have been collected of Australian craftsmen and people who have contributed to the furnishings of the public buildings that Mr Keating happens to inhabit at the moment, hopefully very temporarily, in the Lodge and at Kirribilli House. Australians are no longer allowed to see those because the Australiana Fund did not do what he wanted&mdash;did not let him buy his Thai teak table. So its service is no longer wanted&mdash;a warning and a possible death knell. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I had responsibility for the arts portfolio, I spent an enormous amount of time moving throughout Australia consulting with people in the arts community. Over and over again I heard the misgivings of the arts community caught in the double bind of needing grants and support from the government and yet concerned about the constraints that funding imposed. There are an increasing number of guidelines, expectations and innuendos constraining and directing the cultural life of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the most frequently expressed concerns was the need for works to have an Australian input and content. I am the first one to applaud the increasing amount of world-class artistic works coming out of Australia today, but I also acknowledge the importance of training in and exposure to the classics. Senator McMullan talked about that today. But if the arts community feels that the only way it can get grants is by avoiding performing the classics, we will see a demise of an emphasis on that area as well, which provides a foundation from which we can then move to developing enduring world-class Australian art forms. There ought to be a balance between those. If we get that out of balance because the government is directing it rather than letting the arts community decide what it feels is important, what it feels the Australian community needs to see or wants to see and what it feels it needs to perform, and if we start to see government directing it because it determines grants by its guidelines, we ought to have real concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some information provided to the recent cultural ministers council reveals that clearly the government is considering using its cultural statement to set up a major organisations board which would directly fund a further 16 arts organisations. The grants to these organisations will include objectives for the period based on government priorities. There would be a list of priorities. Here we again see the government intruding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there has to be accountability when funding is given and there has to be appropriate management. But when we start to see the intrusion of guidelines which may determine in some ways what those organisations can perform or the direction in which they are going, then again, as I said, the warning bells ought to start ringing very loudly. If the arts community sells its corporate soul, it will never be able to buy it back. That is the message. The price of conforming with the ALP culture will be mates' rates, jobs for the boys&mdash;and possibly some girls&mdash;and also retribution for non-conformity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tomorrow the community will finally hear the details of the long-awaited cultural statement. They got behind the Prime Minister at the last election and listened to him give his promises. There was a promise that there would be a cultural statement. That was talked about in 1991. Minister Fatin announced membership of a panel in 1992; in February it was announced that the statement was almost done; it was delayed by Senator McMullan; and it was delayed again by Minister Lee. We have been waiting 18 months, the longest gestation period for any statement I have ever seen. That was promised in the election&mdash;and we are getting it tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that was promised was a national museum. Senator McMullan said that all the promises were met. I do not think the people of Canberra would agree that the national museum promise has been met. It was on again, off again, on again last week&mdash;hardly a promise being kept. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other area that was in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS> program was the Australian Cultural Development Foundation. Again, as I moved around, the arts community expressed concern about that and the direction in which the arts were going. One of the things that ought to be of great concern is that the Prime Minister, when launching the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Distinctly Australian</EMPHASIS> statement, talked about the Labor Party being about guiding and creating society, and harnessing feelings through the arts community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. On 25 August 1994 the Selection of Bills Committee referred the Legislative Instruments Bill 1994 to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances for inquiry and report. This was the first time that a bill had been referred to the committee under the selection of bills procedures. The bill, which implements the government's response to the recommendations of the Administrative Review Council in its report on rule-making by Commonwealth agencies, makes important changes to the power of parliament to scrutinise delegated legislation and to access by the public to such legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Delegated legislation, unlike primary legislation, is at present not always easily accessible to the public. The bill should substantially remedy this defect. It provides for an electronic register of all new and existing delegated legislation which the public will be able to scan to find legislation which may affect them. New delegated legislation will not be able to be enforced unless it is registered and existing legislation must be registered within a limited time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for rule-makers to consult with affected parties when making delegated legislation which will affect business. This should ensure that any defects in the proposal are exposed and can be corrected before the instrument is made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also gives parliament a greater role in the scrutiny of delegated legislation. All legislative instruments subject to the bill will be disallowable, which is not the case at present. Delegated legislation must be tabled within six sitting days of registration instead of the present much longer 15 sitting days after making. A house will also be able to defer consideration of a motion of disallowance for up to six months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the above reasons the committee generally supports the bill, which should provide inexpensive and easy access by the public to delegated legislation with more effective control by parliament. The committee has, however, a number of concerns about specific provisions of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In particular, the committee has reservations about a power under which the Attorney-General may issue a conclusive and unreviewable certificate that an instrument is or is not a legislative instrument for the purposes of the bill.

The committee recommends that this power be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other less significant provisions of the bill which the committee suggests should be changed and the present report draws attention to these.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the point I was making. Two years ago a sales tax amendment bill was introduced which had the unintended consequence of removing the tax exemption from transceivers used by operators connecting to the flying doctor network. Under this legislation, that sales tax exemption will be reapplied for wireless transceivers used by people defined as operators of mobile outpost stations. That is all very well, but as well as the mobile outpost stations, does that include the base stations? With this sort of network there is a base station that a pastoralist, for example, might use. The flying doctor network has a lot to do with the pastoral industry, so there is a base and X number of mobiles.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The bill seeks to reinstate the exemption for taxpayers who use wireless transceivers to make contact with radio services conducted by the Royal Flying Doctor Service and similar bodies. However, the problem is not in relation to these sorts of provisions; it is related to the Royal Flying Doctor Service and these sorts of transceivers. It is associated with streamlined sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the current sales tax legislation exempts wireless transceivers for use by authorised persons `mainly' in conjunction with radio services for the RFDS and others. The concern is that the word `mainly' in the legislation has effectively removed the exemption for most people authorised to use wireless transceivers, because it is extremely difficult to satisfy what I term the prescriptive words `for use mainly' test. `Mainly' was defined as meaning more than 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1992, which implements the streamlined sales tax, says that there will be no significant change in the coverage of the exemption. But, as a result of streamlined sales tax, there is now a significant change in the coverage of the exemption for the people who use these transceivers. In my earlier remarks in the committee stage I indicated that the Adelaide branch of the Taxation Office has not been following the strict letter of the law and has been permitting certain organisations to apply the `for use' test existing in prior legislation rather than this legislation. I compliment the people there for the practical approach they took, given the importance of this service to the people in the outback of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By virtue of the practice in South Australia, the tax office obviously holds the view that the current legislation is incorrect. I believe the government needs to address this issue immediately to make sure there is uniform application and to ensure that the original intent prior to streamlined sales tax is followed and adhered to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax exemption is necessary to encourage current remote area communication for emergency purposes and public communications and, more importantly, as a safety measure. I applaud the government for plugging one loophole in relation to this bill, but I draw its attention to another problem that arises in the `mainly for use' test, which effectively precludes a lot of people who I believe are entitled to the exemption from getting it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Watson and Senator Panizza for expressing their concerns. Hopefully, I will cover their points in the explanation I will give. Both Senator Watson and Senator Panizza are concerned that the exemption is narrower under the new sales tax law than it was under the provisions which operated prior to 1 January 1993. Under the old sales tax law, exemption was available for transceivers which transmitted on RFDS frequencies even though use with the RFDS was only incidental.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the sales tax laws, exemption is available only for transceivers that are for use mainly&mdash;that is, more than 50 per cent&mdash;with a radio that is conducted by the RFDS. The RFDS provides an emergency service, including regularly scheduled services, and a public correspondence service. Both these uses and use of any other service conducted by the RFDS can be counted for the purposes of determining whether a transceiver is eligible for exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the new sales tax laws were introduced, it was decided to narrow the scope of the exemption for the following reasons. Firstly, there was evidence that the receivers were being used by transport operators, miners, et cetera in ways which had virtually no connection with the RFDS and that the exemption was therefore not serving its original purpose. Communications equipment is not generally sales tax exempt. The broad exemption under the old law resulted in anomalies in the sales tax treatment of various types of communications equipment. It would be very difficult to draft an amendment which would not be abused. The changes were noted but they were not emphasised in the explanatory memorandum for the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Panizza has raised a further issue. He is concerned that the amendment will have the effect of excluding base stations from the exemption. Persons who wish to use any service provided by the RFDS must have an appropriate licence issued under the Radiocommunications Act. The exemption is available only to persons who hold these licences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The explanatory memorandum states that the relevant licence is `an outpost station' licence, which is a licence usually issued in respect of mobile transceivers for use in the field. However, the exemption is not limited to any particular category of licence and could apply equally to a base station licence, which covers fixed equipment located in homesteads or other permanent locations. Transceiver bases can therefore qualify for exemption under the amended law. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="1805" SPEAKER="Watson Sen J.O.W." NAMEID="VJ4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VJ4">Senator WATSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (5.14 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With respect, I think this is an appalling situation given the importance of the use of radio transceivers, particularly in an emergency. It has always been the case that people have used transceivers for other purposes than real emergencies. As I said previously, it will thwart the purpose and the use of transceivers, which are absolutely invaluable in the event of such emergencies. Given the remoteness of areas and the need for speed, this legislation is a most retrograde step in terms of the services and recognition of the problems faced by people in the outback.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is certainly not a good day for the outback or for the government so far as the outback is concerned because speedy response in emergencies is absolutely vital. It is an essential service in the outback of Australia. Not only can tragic accidents be avoided but the victims of those accidents can receive much more speedy treatment if these sorts of transceivers and this sort of equipment are more freely available. That equipment will not be freely available if the government charges tax on it. It has always been the case for most people using these transceivers that the `mainly for use' test&mdash;the more than 50 per cent test&mdash;could never be satisfied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the government should be using these exemptions from sales tax to encourage the users to purchase receivers and not be worried about the few dollars in tax revenue that it would forgo. This is a safety issue. There should be a recognition of the special place that Australians in the bush have. In view of the wonderful response that Australians made to the appeal for funds for the Royal Flying Doctor Service the other day, with the cooperation of the ABC, I suggest that had Australians known about this legislation at that time, it would have been a very bleak day for the government, which is adopting a mean approach to what has become a traditional and very important Australian mechanism of communication. Over the years thousands of people have relied upon it. I say again that this legislation is a retrograde step and a matter for which the government can only hang its head in shame in its quest to extract the last few dollars from people from whom it should not be extracting this sort of money. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) for defining the situation in relation to base stations. Even though he says that base stations are included, the legislation and the explanatory memorandum do not quite say so. Senator Sherry defined an outpost station licence as being one issued for mobile transceivers used in the field, and that is specified in the explanatory memorandum to the bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry also read into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> that that definition would cover the bases. Bases are covered under a different category. I know that you have a licence. The fact is that I have a picture in my mind of what the situation is. Mobile station licences are in a different category. In fact, base station licences come under category 145 and mobile station licences come under category 156, and they are different sorts of licences. One costs $49 and the other $149. I do not know why they cost $49 and $149 and not $50 and $150, but that is the situation. I believe the definition should have been better explained in the explanatory memorandum and even in the legislation. In time, the government might have to do that, but I thank the government for making the definition definite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with everything Senator Watson said regarding the provision for equipment qualifying for sales tax exemption which states that it has to be `mainly' used for the Royal Flying Doctor Service and allied services. That may be so but, as Senator Watson said, it is very hard to prove that equipment is being used `mainly' for that purpose. I put to the government a couple of reasons why it should look at this again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, if people do not know from other sources they would know from what I have said time and again in this chamber that this government, via the National Transmission Agency, switched off the VLW transmitter in the north-west of Western Australia. An area the size of New South Wales is without any radio service at all. The ABC used to be used for a lot of safety measures and for looking for persons who are needed urgently. It would put calls over the VLW short-wave transmitter and contact might have been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With that VLW transmitter having been switched off, there is no other way to find them. The fact is that the effects from the transmitter being switched off have been felt so much that the RFDS has now put a short summary of weather conditions, important news and other urgent messages over the RFDS network. It is more important than ever before that more of these RFDS mobile transceivers are around, now that the VLW short wave has been switched off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the parliamentary secretary to comment on that, but I take it a bit further than that. If one has a mobile transmitter that has the RFDS frequency, that frequency is generally monitored all day. It is all very well to say that, if there is an emergency, you pick up the mike on your transmitter and call VJQ in Kalgoorlie, for instance, and tell them what your concerns are. But the other sort of traffic is two-way traffic because they may be looking for a particular person. The transmitter must pick up other frequencies. There is the bushfire frequency, for a start. That is essential in an emergency situation. There are other frequencies that may be used in a person's business. Apart from those, the flying doctor frequency is generally monitored all day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No doubt I will be asked, `How come you can monitor that and another frequency as well?' especially if one has a business frequency. There are two ways of doing it. Until about 12 months ago, the base would have had two transceivers. One would be switched on to RFDS all the time. At my place, one set is always switched on to RFDS because on weekends the base is not manned&mdash;although people can get through in an emergency&mdash;and it is possible to help people get out of trouble, which I have done, just by talking to them, advising them what to do&mdash;how to get a motor started or the best way to get themselves out of a bog. But it is monitored all the time with two sets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now, scanning devices in the HF transceivers are scanning all the time. So you are scanning all the frequencies, including the RFDS. Anyone who picks up the RFDS frequency uses that method all the time to get in touch with the RFDS, so it would qualify. Can the parliamentary secretary tell me whether or not it qualifies? The government whip can tell me to wind up my remarks but I will not wind up in a hurry on this matter because it is a very important service for the outback, and I know what it is like to rely on it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Can the parliamentary secretary give us some idea of the extent of the abuse which has brought this kind of regulation into play? If the abuse is significant, I would be concerned, but I wonder whether it is. If the government is going to kill a mosquito by hitting it with a hammer, I am very worried indeed. I would always be prepared to allow a certain amount of abuse to ensure that an essential service was maintained. Every government service is abused to a certain extent. But if the abuse is, as I believe, really minimal, surely there is not much point in trying to stamp out that abuse with this very blunt instrument. I wondered whether the opposition was prepared to move some amendment along these lines. That would have been helpful. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can add a couple of further points, although I do think the matter has been substantially answered. Whether or not honourable senators agree with the answer is up to them. In terms of the point raised by Senator Panizza, it will depend on the evidence that is gathered, if there is a clear use of the RFDS for purposes that are not appropriate by a transport operator, a trucker or a miner&mdash;and that is where the significant abuse of this sales tax exemption has occurred. As with all regulations, if someone abuses it, evidence will have to be gathered. The main test will depend on the number of calls, I assume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the matter raised by Senator Woodley, the sorts of services he outlined do not come within the legitimate use of RFDS, as I am advised. He says that every government service is subject to some form of abuse. I do not take that as an excuse for not minimising the sort of abuse that this service has been subjected to, unfortunately, by some transport operators and some miners. It has become reasonably serious. I cannot give figures from the department; we do not have them here today. But it has been a serious abuse issue amongst a number of operators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson, in one of his heroic work-up moods, as I describe it, says that this is an attack on the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It is not an attack on the Royal Flying Doctor Service; it is an attack on people who are misusing a provision that they should not be entitled to. The persons who are not entitled to misuse the service are people like transport operators and miners. If we accept that these forms of equipment are not sales tax exempt, why should a number of people use what has in the past been a loophole quite incorrectly, at the cost of government revenue? That is why the government has decided to close this loophole.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, once again the Senate gets the opportunity to address another very important and historic piece of legislation. On this occasion it is the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. This piece of legislation flows through in a continuum of legislation that has been brought about by the development of various aspirations for Aboriginal people throughout Australia, and in many ways brings together a number of the commitments and special obligations that were created and imposed by this Labor government following the enactment last year of the native title legislation that flowed through and followed from the historic Mabo decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is incumbent on this parliament to look very carefully at all legislation of this nature. We have gone through a tremendous investment of time, a tremendous investment of issues, and a great deal of consultation with Aboriginal people throughout Australia and with many other interested groups who are affected by the import and changes that legislation can bring. It is also a very serious indictment that the government has to deal through legislation with so much of the correction of problems for Aboriginal people. I say that very sincerely. Since the referendum of 1967 governments have had before them an obligation to Aboriginal people throughout Australia that has not been properly addressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we go to the issues that are fundamental in addressing what are often broadly described as problems for Aboriginal people, we must deal with and cope first with the very core emotions of why Aboriginal people themselves see `problems'. I would identify three important areas of core emotion that are generally defined by Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first is dignity: so many Aboriginal people throughout this nation, despite all the intent and changes of the last 20 or so years, are still paralysed by despair. The second emotion that Aboriginal people have to deal with is marginalisation: the feeling of powerlessness, of lack of participation, of lack of involvement in the wider community and what is so importantly caught up with it. The third core emotion that has to be dealt with is that of bitterness by Aboriginal people with regard to the issues that they must address, and this entire area that I would define as a feeling of alienation within the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we track through those core emotions we have to go to the causes. What are the causes of them that still express themselves? Probably the most important one that I would identify is poverty; the second is that of identity. If I can talk for a moment about poverty: this expresses itself through the areas of minimal education, poor housing, homelessness and lack of accommodation, disease, ill health, alcohol and substance abuse, and, more recently, problems resulting in the health area of HIV and STD risks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of identity, it is often the wider community's problem because it has failed to address the ethical foundations of Aboriginal society. The community has not formed a proper and decent appreciation of traditional Aboriginal culture and, more recently in our society, contemporary Aboriginal culture, which must also be properly recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do these emotions and these causes manifest themselves? They have many effects and expressions in our community. Generally the ones that come before us, because they are so visual, are unfortunately the areas that are highlighted again and again by negative media. They are the areas of violence, discrimination, inappropriate administration and, very recently because of the things that have happened through ATSIC and other areas, leadership tensions in the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must come back always to questioning the motivation of politicians, the motivation of bureaucrats and the motivation of Aboriginal people as they start to emerge through the broad community. Today, if anyone wanted to put together a library of events or academe or of good study of these issues in Australia, I am sure that we could almost call for a special library of Aboriginal interests in Australia. There have been volumes of words said and, unfortunately, it comes to this point of tension that we must always look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was attracted to some papers that were produced recently by a group of Christian leaders who were attempting to address this issue. They sought to explore a range of issues and tried to involve so many of these areas that I have identified as core emotions or causes or effects. There were many prominent academics participating in that particular conference. There were a number of anthropologists, including Dr Stephen Davis and Dr Ron Brunton. There were a number of politicians including the Labor Party's Mr Graeme Campbell, the member for Kalgoorlie. Very interesting papers were presented by theologians across a wide scope of Australians. A very interesting paper was given by Sir Harry Gibbs, formerly of the High Court. I was attracted to many of the issues that were highlighted right through all of those areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points made by Sir Harry Gibbs was that, according to the results of the last census, the indigenous peoples comprise 238,590 persons regarded as Aborigines and 26,902 regarded as Torres Strait Islanders; in all, just over 1.5 per cent of the total population. Sir Harry Gibbs broke that up by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the total number of Aboriginal people, 33 per cent live in rural areas, 24 per cent in major urban areas and 42 per cent in other urban areas.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, if we track back through all of those particular issues, we come up with these particular areas that need to be highlighted. Let me quote some of the other speakers at that conference. Dr Steven Davis, on culture, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many anthropologists have for so long viewed Aboriginal cultural as being static. Of recent times with the many land claims and now native title claims it is becoming obvious that there is a significant fluidity in Aboriginal culture. It is clear that Aboriginal culture is not static but rather it is fluid, vibrant and dynamic.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, on bureaucracy, Dr Davis said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In its knowing and presumptuous way the government has set up structure after structure to `cure the Aboriginal problem'. In fact, what has largely been achieved is the replacement of a bureaucracy dominated by whites, with a bureaucracy dominated by Aborigines with little if any traditional background. This new bureaucracy, Aboriginal in name only, does not reflect the traditional structure of Aboriginal authority. Thus the new quasi-Aboriginal bureaucracy has continued the work of much of the European bureaucracy in undermining traditional Aboriginal structure and destroying the social fabric of traditional Aboriginal life.</PARA>
<PARA>It was Mr Graeme Campbell, the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, who said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Aboriginal industry is a cancer which thrives on a guilt-induced diet of $2 billion a year and consumes the responsibility, independence and ultimately the dignity of the very people it purports to serve.</PARA>
<PARA>They are damning statements to a conference that set out to address this particular issue. They go a long way towards explaining why, in the challenge of the next 20 years, we cannot and must not repeat all of the mistakes and go over all of the problems and the financial wastage that have hurt so many Aboriginal people for so long. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the legislation before us today comes about after a decade of failure by a Labor government. That is a very severe and damning indictment. Looking back over that decade, let us address for a few moments issues such as the relationships in Aboriginal affairs between the states and the territories. What have they been? How have they manifested themselves? Basically, the situation has been of frustration and counterproductive effort. If we look at the initiatives that were highlighted in the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and all of the programs flowed from it, basically we see that that was a camouflage. The results that have flowed through have been a camouflage by putting tags on government expenditure items. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was the ATSIC dream. In 1989 in this parliament we set up a new bureaucracy which, as Dr Davis said, replaced a white bureaucracy with a black bureaucracy. Aboriginal people are now questioning the values of that ATSIC dream. The CDEP program is trying to introduce the work ethic. There are some very good examples of this throughout Australia but there are also a lot of failures. In the whole area of initiatives in the Department of Employment, Education and Training, training and education ought to be the outcome but, unfortunately, so many of those programs are doing nothing but creating false expectations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the area of land rights, which we addressed last year in the native title legislation, we can look through Labor's gospel and see that it does not produce results. Mabo, native title, and now this legislation do not guarantee what Aboriginal people are looking for. I know from my own electorate's point of view that if we look at the focus of the Northern Territory's land rights act and other legislation over a period we see that what has really emerged is a land council monopoly which for too long has been run by the Australian Labor Party's left-wing agenda. It has only been in the last year or so that we have started to see that issue being addressed fundamentally and the land councils moving away&mdash;and they have moved away&mdash;from this dominance of control that has created so many of these problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look very carefully at this legislation we see that it sets out to provide for the acquisition of land for Aboriginal people and Torres Strait Islanders who are unable to benefit from native title. The bill also establishes the Indigenous Land Corporation to manage the acquisition of land and to provide for the management of land held by indigenous people. These are important aspirations and there are going to be very big tests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me remind the Senate that we can certainly demonstrate from the Northern Territory's point of view that land of itself does not cure the issues of health. Aboriginal health is still appalling. Graphs that I have seen very recently prove very dramatically that when we relate mortality from all causes&mdash;respiratory diseases, infectious diseases, or diseases of the circulatory system&mdash;to areas where Aborigines have lived for ever, such as Arnhem Land or in the central parts of Central Australia, and where they have basically held land continuously, we find that the worst affected areas for mortality and disease are in those very areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the Northern Territory, we have had the experience of the land rights act since 1976. There has been an important exchange of correspondence between the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Perron, and the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) over this legislation that we are addressing today. Mr Perron has set out that there are major points that need to be made with regard to those areas. I was pleased to see that the Northern Territory Minister for Aboriginal Development, Mr Steve Hatton, appeared before the Senate committee that looked at this legislation. I note that my colleagues Senator Ellison, Senator Campbell and Senator Troeth, in their minority report to that Senate inquiry, highlighted many of those very issues that Mr Hatton and the Northern Territory government have been raising continually. In that regard, I seek leave to table an exchange of five  letters between the Northern Territory Chief Minister and the Prime Minister on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are so many issues that time does not allow us to address. I was pleased to note a paper that was delivered to my office in parliament house last week. It was distributed by the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation and by ATSIC. It was over the signature of Patrick Dodson, as chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, and Charles Perkins, the deputy chairperson of ATSIC. It brought together a summary of reports of consultations right around Aboriginal communities. It is a very important document.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It refers to many of the issues with which we have had to deal here in this parliament&mdash;issues which, from a white man's perspective, we have been harping on far too often. It has often been felt that the criticisms were being imposed by the opposition, or by parliament, or by white fellas. But this is a document that brings together a whole series of consultations throughout the Aboriginal community. It highlights and brings home many of those same priorities&mdash;accountability, employment, housing&mdash;that are all so fundamentally related to providing benefits for those Aborigines who do not have land rights bestowed on them by the Northern Territory land rights act or by the native title legislation. Many of the issues are in the sections under access and equity, and equity and accountability, where Aboriginal people suggest options and float many ideas which I think are deserving of a lot of commendation and a lot of addressing. It will be incumbent on ATSIC, as the principal bureaucracy in this area, to pick up many of those issues and properly address them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware that last year I called for a special audit by the Australian National Audit Office into the land councils. That report was very important because it brought down some 53 recommendations for very significant change. Let me prophesy, let me point the bone, let me say that we must watch and be careful that any of the mechanisms we now create under this legislation to set up very special investment boards, handling sums of money which will accumulate to $1.5 billion, do not repeat those very problems into which the land councils got themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) basically delegated his authority away from his essential primary responsibility in the history of the last five or 10 years, and millions of dollars, properly the property of Aboriginal people, were totally dissipated and wasted. The precedent of that report into the Northern Land Council is one that must, at all times, be read alongside this legislation and what we are now seeking to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This last weekend whilst I was in Canberra, I had the opportunity to look at the excellent art exhibition at the National Gallery. It is an excellent exhibition from the point of view of traditional Aboriginal art and also of modern urban art. Whilst much of that art in the modern urban section is very angry and very bitter, it is a very important statement by these Aboriginal artists and how&mdash;quoting from the catalogue&mdash;two artists in particular, Gordon Bennett and Richard Bell, `explore the development of negative stereotypes of Aboriginal people which have been created since the coming of Europeans and which led to popular misconceptions and downright lies concerning indigenous people'. That is a very fundamental expression in a visual form. In this legislation we are again trying to come to grips with it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which was tabled last week. The government acceded to a very cursory glance at this legislation and walked away from the fundamental responsibilities that the parliament needed to address. It was again left to my colleagues in the minority report to put down some 40 pages of recommendations which we will be bringing here by way of amendments. I note that the Australian Democrats and the Greens (WA) have been attracted to many of those fundamental issues but not the Australian Labor Party. It still wants to be run by a left wing, patronising agenda of telling Aboriginal people where and how they should be going. That is not the way this legislation should be progressed, nor is it in the best interests of listening to the voice of Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much is to be gained for this legislation in the whole spirit of reconciliation. Much is to be gained for Aboriginal people.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994 is very important indeed. In fact, in December last year when this Senate engaged in what I believe is the longest debate in its history, on the Native Title Act, many people thought that that was one of the most important pieces of legislation which the Senate had ever dealt with. But not many people realise that the origins of this legislation are found in that part of the preamble to the Native Title Act which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also important to recognise that many Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, because they have been dispossessed of their traditional lands, will be unable to assert native title rights and interests and that a special fund needs to be established to assist them to acquire land.</PARA>
<PARA>So, at the start, we see in that legislation that the government acknowledged that there were two groups of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In fact, I recall the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) stating that five per cent or thereabouts of Aboriginal people would be able to claim native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This legislation really has much more to do with catering for the land needs of the Aboriginal population of this country. It is of wider application. I would suggest that the government has failed to recognise this in its legislation, because the spectrum of people this legislation should be looking after runs from an Aboriginal person in Redfern to a fringe dweller in Kalgoorlie in Western Australia. In fact, it was a matter raised in the recent report by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration&mdash;a report that I was thankful to be involved in and for which I had the privilege of taking evidence. Mr Aden Ridgeway, the executive officer of the New South Wales Land Council, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The principle consequence of moving the scheme from the Native Title Act to the ATSIC Act is that the preamble to the Native Title Act will no longer provide any assistance in interpreting the powers of the Indigenous Land Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA>That point was driving at the fact that the preamble to the Native Title Act, which I have just recited, is not to be found in this bill. I would have thought that the starting point would have been that part of the preamble of the Native Title Act to give this bill its proper direction; but, unfortunately, it is not and I believe that it should be incorporated in this legislation so that it remains a statement for generations to come as to what precisely this land fund is about. I questioned Senator Gareth Evans on this point during the course of the committee hearing that I mentioned. I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I understand that the purpose of this legislation is to cater for those Aboriginal groups which might not be catered for by the Native Title Act. Is that the case?</PARA>
<PARA>And he replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yes, essentially. It also caters for those who are not able to take advantage of the provisions of the Northern Territory Land Rights Act, which will continue to have applicability until 1997.</PARA>
<PARA>So we need to be very clear at the outset about what this bill is intended to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect which needs attention in this bill is the criteria for granting land or for making grants in relation to the management of land. At the moment the bill provides that the purpose of such grants is to provide economic, environmental, social or cultural benefits for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. I would have no quarrel with that. But there are wider aspects to be looked at in the granting of land and assistance for the management of land. I believe that the coalition's proposition for health, housing, educational needs, or economic viability just make commonsense in relation to how this land fund is administered. During the hearing I put to Senator Gareth Evans that the question of water and its availability might be a key issue in the granting of land to, say, fringe dwellers in an area where they have no native title but where they perhaps chose to live on the outskirts of a town because they have lived there for some time. I have no problem with that but one does have to look at the provision of water, sanitation and the basic conditions that any human being should enjoy. That is essential also in providing funds for land management because it establishes some priority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have already seen that the government coffers are limited. If there has to be a choice between two Aboriginal groups and one is in desperate need of funding for the management of its land which would incorporate dams and windmills, that needs to be included in this criteria for grants because another group that might need money for the construction of a shed or the clearing of property to improve it might not be in as much need as the former group. But the present criteria will not help in the determination of how to grant those funds. If this is to be incorporated in any sort of reconciliation process, it cannot be denied that matters such as health or economic viability are essential in the administration of this fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other aspect is the preparation of national and regional land strategies. For my part, I would prefer to see regional strategies prepared before national strategies. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in a given region are much more equipped to provide input for their particular area than are bureaucrats in Canberra, but as this bill is structured, we have the national strategy and the regional strategies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems I found during this hearing in relation to the bill was the lack of consultation by the government in assessing what exactly Aboriginal people wanted. I cannot speak on behalf of Aboriginal people, but I can certainly relate to the Senate what I heard in that hearing. I can tell honourable senators that Dickey Cox from the Kimberley Aboriginal Association and Robert Bropho from Swan Valley certainly had not been consulted sufficiently in relation to what they thought should go into this bill. I am not saying that those who came along and said that they had been consulted sufficiently had any case to answer in this matter. They certainly did not. The body that has the case to answer in this matter is the government. It is the government which had the carriage of this matter and the carriage of wide consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aden Ridgeway acknowledged that in the Aboriginal community we would find diverse opinion and differing views. There is nothing wrong with that. We would find that in the wider community of Australia. When dealing with human beings, if there are two in one room, people could bet their bottom dollar that there would be some sort of difference between those two people. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that but, having acknowledged that, does the government go further? Does the government go and consult with individual groups or does it just consult with the land councils concerned?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is no criticism of the land councils; it is a criticism of the government for not seeing that there is more to the Aboriginal community and Torres Strait Islander people than just land councils. There are small groups, families and Aboriginal trusts all over this country that need to be consulted. That just was not done, and we can see that in the drafting of this bill because one of the fundamental flaws of this bill is that grants are available only to corporations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 26 August this year, Noel Pearson said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Meanwhile, strategies for self determination and self management&mdash;involving Aborigines managing structures imposed by non-Aborigines&mdash;was often mistakenly installed in its place.</PARA>
<PARA>He was saying that we used the structures of white men in order to govern the affairs of the Aboriginal people. If a corporation is not an Anglo-Saxon structure, then I am afraid I am absolutely mystified as to what it is. I believe the fundamental flaw in the Native Title Act was that we had this problem of title not being granted to individuals, and there was a good deal of controversy in relation to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I took part in the hearings in relation to the legal and constitutional committee in relation to that bill and there were a substantial number of witnesses who said that native title is a matter which should be enjoyed in an individual sense. I have had experience in Western Australia of communities which are not incorporated. I have had experience with families who exist and live in an area and are not incorporated. In fact, in some areas the number of indigenous people can be few and the setting up of a corporation may not be in their interests. This bill entirely overlooks that. Aboriginal groups have to be a corporation in order to fit in with this bill. It is the all-encompassing, centralist approach that this government loves to indulge in. That is where I say that this bill is fundamentally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect is that this bill allows for the granting of land which is separate to native title land. I put it this way: if the small percentage that the minister mentioned can claim a piece of land, then that piece of land should not be available for a land fund grant. The land fund is about giving land to those Aboriginal people who cannot maintain a native title claim. If we mix in the two, I tell the Senate now solemnly, we will rue the day because we will be encouraging division between Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation could arise that we grant to one group, a dispossessed group which cannot maintain native title, a piece of land. We then have another group which can then maintain a native title claim over that piece of land and we then have a conflict of interests&mdash;a classic conflict of interests. We should insert provisions in this bill which ensure that as much as possible the Indigenous Land Corporation ensures that the land which is about to be granted or which it will acquire to pass on to Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander groups is not the subject of a native title claim. That is another fundamental flaw. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects, too, which concern me in relation to this bill and these were all raised in the minority report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Briefly, the aspects of accountability in relation to the Indigenous Land Corporation, I believe, do not go far enough. I believe there is insufficient accountability, not only for the recipients of the land but also for the Indigenous Land Corporation itself. If we do not provide clear guidelines and rules of accountability, we leave a body such as the Indigenous Land Corporation open to attack. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also do not provide that assurance to the recipients. For instance, there should be a time limit that if the Indigenous Land Corporation says it will grant land or do something it will do it within a certain amount of time so that the recipients know that they will get that within so many months, that such and such will be done in relation to the management of the land within a certain time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also stress that in relation to the running of the land in question the board should possess, among other attributes which are covered in the legislation as to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, the attributes of some skill in the management of land. I am not saying that perhaps the whole board needs to have qualifications in relation to land management or land development, but there needs to be expertise on that board in relation to land management. After all, we have millions of dollars of taxpayers' money being used in the position of trust for recipients who really are placing their trust in the proper exercise of duty and management of this Indigenous Land Corporation. So the corporation owes two duties of care: one to the Aboriginal people it is supposed to be serving and the other to the taxpayer at large who is funding it. The government of the day needs to wake up to this and ensure that there is expertise there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another aspect which appeals to me is that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander members of that board should be as diverse as possible. I mentioned the differing views we had in the Aboriginal community and in relation to the hearing when we looked into this bill. I see nothing in this bill which states that the government should address that aspect; that is, to make a conscious effort to accommodate the wide group that we have in the Aboriginal community, not only land councils but also individual communities, fringe dwellers and urban dwellers so that the people from Redfern to the people living on the fringes of Kalgoorlie have some sort of representation on the board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are other aspects, which I will not go into detail about. Suffice it to say that when we are dealing with land tenure we have to provide protection to the land holder and also to third parties who come along and deal with the land. I believe the coalition has some commendable amendments in relation to third interests. This point was actually made in evidence by Aden Ridgeway. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any land or interest in land which is acquired by a body corporate with the assistance of the ILC other than by way of guaranteeing a loan cannot be sold, mortgaged or otherwise disposed of without the consent of the ILC. Any such disposal without that consent is deemed to be of no effect or null and void.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not provide any mechanism by which the ILC is obliged to lodge any caveat giving notice of its interest. There is a very real likelihood that any third parties that may be involved in any land transactions or deals would be unaware of the ILC's interests, and those parties may be prejudiced by unauthorised dealings.</PARA>
<PARA>If this bill is not drafted correctly, if the government does not get it right in the first instance, it will only create division. If there are third parties who are the victims of, say, an unauthorised dealing in the land, I would put it to the Senate that the blame should rest largely at the door of the government for not ensuring that there were sufficient safeguards in this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, what we are about in this Senate is ensuring that the legislation we pass is proper, effective and achieves what it sets out to do. I do not believe this land fund does that. There are many flaws with it. I believe no-one could argue with the preamble that I cited at the outset, and it has much merit. But are we putting that preamble into effect with this intended legislation? That is the question. I would say to the Senate that indeed we are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have a duty to ensure that every dollar is accounted for; that it is spent efficiently; that it benefits the recipients we intend to benefit; that it affords to the taxpayers security so that they know that their dollar is being spent properly; and that the people whom we set out to help know that they are getting the best help possible and that, along the way, it is not being wasted or it is not being lost in some giant bureaucratic machine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition has some worthwhile amendments, and I have also seen some other amendments, from other sectors not aligned to my party, that I think have some merit. The government's intransigence in this matter is</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The main reason why I want to speak in this debate is to answer a couple of the points made by Senator Ellison and his colleagues from the opposition who were members of the former Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public  Administration inquiry into the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill 1994. I first emphasise that this proposal for a land fund is not a new proposal. It is provided for in the Native Title Act. All that this bill does is transfer the administrative arrangements for that land fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole concept of it was part of the consultations and the debate leading up to the enactment of the Native Title Act. Despite the assertions about the lack of consultation by the opposition and by some witnesses before the finance and public administration committee, there was in fact a high level of consultation; and it is difficult to see how much wider the consultation could have been on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing to emphasise that is mentioned in the majority report of the committee on this bill is that the issue of health and education, which the opposition has wanted to drag into this matter, is indeed a matter for the social justice package, which also is a relevant part of the whole dealing with this Aboriginal affairs matter, which was again part of the negotiations leading up to the drafting of the Native Title Bill and which is part of the overall process of the government in dealing with this matter. The land fund is dealing with the issue of land for those who do not have access under the Native Title Act. The social justice package is designed to deal with those other issues of education, health and so on. I am looking forward to that as the next step in this overall process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular matter I want to draw attention to is one part of the opposition committee members' minority report. I would be particularly interested in Senator Ellison's response to this because I do not believe that he, Senator Campbell or Senator Troeth read the draft of this minority report before they signed it. I do not believe they could have. Obviously someone other than Senator Campbell, Senator Troeth and Senator Ellison wrote this minority report, but they have signed it and ought to take responsibility for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could not work out whether to be angry, annoyed or just puzzled by the comments of Senator Ellison, Senator Campbell and Senator Troeth on this matter. Maybe they can explain to me at some time the basis of these comments. I will quote the last part of their minority report, under the heading `Witnesses Biased'. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is one of the saddest indictments of a Senate Committee for the majority Government members to state at the outset of a report that it mostly invited witnesses that had some objection to the Bill. The ALP Senators then go on to reject all the evidence of the witnesses except that of the Minister, ATSIC and the Central Land Council.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a disgraceful and judgemental conclusion for the Committee to report they had called witnesses on the basis of their views.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Chairman of the Committee should make an explanation to the Senate as to why he decided to invite a biased group to give evidence.</PARA>
<PARA>I guess I will be satisfied with just being puzzled about it rather than angry. But the point is that, in the discussions between me and Senator Campbell over who should be invited to give evidence to the committee, it was acknowledged, as it is naturally acknowledged by all committees when they are preparing a list of witnesses, that there should be an attempt to ensure that people who have particular suggestions to make about how the bill should be different are given some additional ability to give evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole point of the comment in the report that most of the witnesses called were those who had some objection to the bill, I would have thought, was that it was just an obvious way of dealing with the bill.

If we wanted an overall response based on all the Aboriginal groups that there were around the country, we could have had a team of thousands. Of course, there was agreement between us that it should be limited to save committee time, to save people trouble and expense in having a whole string of people. It was agreed, in order to ensure that the contrary views were adequately represented, that that would be covered by those alternative witnesses that were suggested. I wish to place on record my rejection of the unreasonable, to say the very least, comment by the opposition members of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to deal quickly with the other matter in that section of the opposition's dissenting report. They say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is useful to note that the ATSIC representative, after just one witness opposed the Bill, decided to withdraw from the table and refused to answer criticism of the Bill or ATSIC's role in consultation on the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>What actually happened was that I had suggested that the ATSIC representatives might like to remain at the table in case issues arose during the questioning of the other witnesses which they might like to deal with. It was entirely my suggestion and, on reflection, it was probably inappropriate. I had not consulted with the ATSIC representatives before I had made that suggestion, and obviously I should have. The situation was that they wanted to be regarded as witnesses, not as just other assistants of the minister and the department. It was a question of protocol&mdash;that is all: they saw themselves not as just other officials assisting the minister but as giving their opinion as a distinct set of witnesses, as were the other witnesses. It was just a question of protocol: they saw that it emphasised their status as witnesses not to remain at the table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to this question of refusing to answer criticism of the bill or ATSIC's role in consultation on the bill, as I made clear at the time and as could have happened at any committee member's suggestion, those ATSIC representatives could have been requested to return to the table and give evidence and answer other questions later in the day, as I had foreshadowed early in the piece in any case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was no refusal on their part, merely an indication that they should be at the table only when called to give evidence rather than just be seen as assisting the minister and the representatives of the department. Any committee member could have asked for them to return if there were any further questions to be asked of them. No such request or suggestion was made.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support my colleagues on this bill, which is known as the indigenous land bill. The main purpose of this bill is to establish a fund which Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders can access for the purpose of purchasing land. The beneficiaries will be those who do not benefit from the Native Title Bill. That is a very hard definition to accept.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any fund must have a fund manager. So we are establishing an indigenous land corporation to provide management for the acquisition of such land. It will be accessed by those who are dispossessed. I presume the ones that are dispossessed the most are the ones that are living in the big regional centres and cities and may not want to access land or even go back to the tribal lands of their forefathers. We are going to establish this land management by amending section 201 of the Native Title Act that we passed last year. The Prime Minister, Mr Keating, in his second reading speech, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is difficult for non-indigenous Australians to understand what Australia's indigenous people feel about the loss of their land.</PARA>
<PARA>I presume Mr Keating was saying that the Aborigines have not got access to any land, or minimal access to land, at this stage. So I will give a few figures from my own state of Western Australia. In Western Australia land held in various forms, but not including pastoral land that was bought by ATSIC and not including freehold land bought for Aboriginal organisations, totals 27.1 million hectares; in other words, 271,000 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you know, being a senator from Victoria, Madam Acting Deputy President, the size of Victoria is 227,000 square kilometres. Tasmania is 67,000 square kilometres. That means that the 271,000 square kilometres of land held by Aboriginal organisations in Western Australia&mdash;not including ATSIC pastoral areas, let me reiterate&mdash;is four times the size of Tasmania. The total area of Victoria and Tasmania is 294,600 square kilometres. So the land held by Western Australian Aboriginals is only 23,600 square kilometres short of the landmass of Victoria and Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do not let the Prime Minister tell anybody that the Aboriginals are devoid of land in Australia. The Aboriginals of Western Australia have more land than the size of Victoria. Their area is half the size of France&mdash;and France has 543,965 square kilometres. So in Western Australia alone they have land half the size of France and more than the size of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland which have 244,755 square kilometres. I again remind government senators that that is only the Aboriginals of Western Australia. They have land nine times the size of Belgium, which has 30,520 square kilometres. Their land is more than twice the size of Greece. Someone might know the population of Greece. If not, Senator Bolkus would be able to tell us. He could give us a good idea, just as I could give a good idea of the population of Italy&mdash;in case someone thinks I am being racist. As I said, Aboriginals have land that amounts to more than twice the size of Greece, which has 151,985 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal population of Western Australia at the last available census was 41,779. When Mr Keating says that the Aboriginals of Australia&mdash;and I have pointed out the case in Western Australian&mdash;are without ground, it shows that he has as much grip on this situation as he has on most other portfolios around the place, especially economic portfolios. Of course, all these things exclude the massive number of hectares tied up in pastoral stations that have been bought by ATSIC. Unfortunately, they have been mismanaged by the people whom ATSIC has put in place. I do not decry the effort of buying pastoral land on behalf of Aboriginals, provided the improvements are kept up and the Aboriginals at least try to run it as an economic unit. Otherwise, the great pastoral industry of Western Australia and, indeed, all of Australia will be in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is being done with the land that is already theirs? I am not talking about the land they may want to buy. In many cases they are doing nothing. I know one good farm holding&mdash;I am not talking about a pastoral holding&mdash;on agricultural land along the Moore River in Western Australia. Western Australians may remember that area as the Moore River Mission or the Magumba Mission of years gone by. It is a top-class farming area with high rainfall on the north of the Moore River. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From what I can see there, that land can run upwards of 10,000 sheep. It could take cropping. There is a lot of housing there: a lot of workshops, shearing sheds and so on. On the last visit I made to the place I found the Aboriginal population to be nil. I visit it quite often because I lease a farm on a long-term basis&mdash;I have for the last 15 years&mdash;straight opposite them on the river. There was only white management&mdash;a white manager and others working the place. I suppose they are working the place on behalf of Aboriginals. It seems to be an economic unit so some finance may flow into other things that help the Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But this is not the Pilbara, the Eastern Goldfields, the Murchison or the Kimberleys. It is no more than approximately 150 kilometres out of Perth. There is the odd Aboriginal there, mostly on the weekend, on shooting expeditions. Magumba was supposed to be set up as a training centre to train young Aborigines to work and manage their own land; but something has gone mighty wrong because there are never any Aboriginals there. A lot of the infrastructure is breaking down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is this bill about? It is about getting more land for Aboriginals. I have shown the Senate what has happened just in one place&mdash;and there are plenty of others. Some of the pastoral stations of the Kimberleys have been run pretty well by Aboriginals. By the same token, some are a disgrace. One is the Strelley group at Port Hedland which I have mentioned in this place before. It is a disgrace. The government should have an inquiry into what has been done there and into the money that has been wasted and creamed off by the white Aboriginal industry around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This bill is to set up a fund to get more land for Aborigines. I presume that it is for a lot of those Aborigines who are city based.

Has anyone really asked the main Aboriginal population whether they want this sort of help&mdash;this ground? My rhetorical question seems to have created amusement in the advisers box, but I will continue. Has anyone asked them? As Senator McMullan may know, the white population is drifting out of the remote areas of Australia into the cities. Is the Aboriginal population going to be any different?

Then they will take more responsibility. What happens if they do go out to the more isolated areas? It creates problems similar to those that have already been created. An example is the lack of drinking water, as Senator Ellison has already pointed out. What is the use of setting up a community where there is little or no drinking water? It creates sewerage and health problems in very tough country. I have questioned enough the management of the land they have acquired. I believe that these funds should be going into health, housing and education. Those opposite will tell us they are doing enough already.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a point; I believe that would come under health. But the government has thrown money at other things under health. There are doctors in even very remote areas like Fitzroy Crossing and Halls Creek; they have more doctors than wheat belt towns have. But that does not seem to be working and the health of people in those areas is not improving. A report&mdash;its release is around the corner&mdash;supposedly on AIDS amongst Aboriginals in Western Australia, shows that health is going backwards and not forwards. Health plus education plus housing is the best way to help not only Aborigines, but anyone, including Italians, Greeks, Croatians and Macedonians who have come to Australia from overseas. That is the way to help them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, there are doctors on the edge of the city of Perth, for instance, who work for free to help Aborigines, especially Aboriginal children. But we have to educate Aborigines as to what doctors are doing so that they will access them. What is the point of bringing a child to a doctor when the child is nearly dead? That is where education has to get through. There was one famous&mdash;or infamous&mdash;case in Western Australia where a mother brought a child to a doctor when the child was almost dead. The doctor quickly administered drugs and asked why she had not brought it in earlier. The child picked up for a week and then unfortunately died. Aborigines have to be educated to bring in sick children earlier if the facilities are there. That is where education comes in. Australian doctors are doing something towards helping, but Aborigines have to be taught to access them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Money is going into education to try to educate Aborigines to become professionals. I know the University of Newcastle has a quota for Aboriginal medical students and Murdoch University in Western Australia has five places set aside for Aboriginal veterinary students; they are given considerations and concessions to get them through. The way to go is to get them educated. If Aborigines want to live in good houses, houses that fit their needs&mdash;because they seem to want to live differently from the rest of Australia&mdash;then they should design housing. On my farm I do not build the sort of house that would be built in Dalkeith&mdash;even if I had the sort of money needed to build a house in Dalkeith&mdash;I build a house that suits the farm. That is what the advisers, the architects and the developers should be doing with houses for Aboriginals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say again that the Aboriginals this legislation should benefit the most are the city based Aboriginals who have been dispossessed, and it will urge them to go back. What is being done? Nothing in this bill says where this land will be bought, but there is plenty in and around it which says it will be community based and country sort of land. I do not think that will work in any way whatsoever because it will create more problems. If we can improve Aboriginals' health, housing and education, they will make their own decisions in due course. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I live where I live because I find it economical to do so and I find it to be a good lifestyle, but picking up people who are already city based, even though this land and money are available, will only create further problems. I believe that any money that is spent from this land fund should start with those basics, and the benefits will flow on. We will not fix this problem in two ups. It has taken 200 years to get where we are now. I believe it will take at least another 30 years of education so that they can sort out their own future. That is what we have to work at. We will not do it by throwing money at organisations which are not accountable, and where a lot of it is creamed off into the white Aboriginal society which has grown up. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a brief contribution to the ATSIC Amendment (Indigenous Land Corporation and Land Fund) Bill. I have very serious reservations about the value of the package and its benefits to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, especially as it is for those who do not benefit under the Mabo legislation. The motives of some politicians and some Aboriginal leaders also worry me. It appears to be just another chapter in saying, `Here's some more money.' Money is not the answer. It never has been and never will be. The fact that this expensive package is dressed up in land does not convince me that the health, welfare and prospects of Aboriginal Australians will improve. I am worried about getting value for money. Throwing money at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has failed dismally, actually worsening the problems in many areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 16 years from 1971 to 1986 the median age for Aboriginal school leavers increased by only 10 weeks. That is an incremental increase of only 3 1/2 school days per year. The jobless rate for Aboriginal men jumped from 6.6 per cent in 1971 to over 30 per cent in 1991. Further, Aboriginal people still earn only half the income earned by white Australians, and their life expectancy is 20 years less than that of other Australians. Child mortality for Aboriginal Australians is three times higher than the national average. Yet, despite all this, the amount of money allocated to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people has ballooned from $24 million in 1971 to $1.3 billion annually. There is more to be spent under this legislation, not on welfare but in the pursuit of justice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concern I have is that land in the Mabo context&mdash;which is acknowledged to benefit about only five per cent of our indigenous people&mdash;and now money in the context of this legislation, is just another attempt by this government to make itself feel good, with no convincing benefit. I do not know who can claim it but somebody is on the record as saying `Don't try and do us any more good; your attempts have done us enough harm already.' I think that is very appropriate in our attempts to meet the legitimate aspirations of many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our attempts to improve the prospects for them have been mixed, but the first point I wish to make is that an enormous amount of goodwill has been expended on our indigenous people. I mean that in the most generous sense. Unfortunately, this has rarely, if ever, been recognised. This probably does not wash well in the politically correct environment in which we speak, but the millions of dollars wasted, and the work of the churches and the welfare agencies, and the work of many dedicated people in the early days&mdash;like that of my late grandmother at Goodooga in the far west of New South Wales&mdash;have been motivated by people with an immense amount of goodwill. I say to Aboriginal Australians: `Recognise the efforts that have been made. It is up to you to aim for integration and partnership in this, your country.' I recognise that many Aboriginal Australians are not benefiting from the wealth of their nation, but neither are a lot of non-Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I would like to make is that I believe in one nation, one Australia. The worry I have about the Aboriginal agenda setters is that behind all of this rhetoric of getting a fair go is the creation of a separate Aboriginal landmass which would not improve the lifestyle of most Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. The preoccupation with a separate and special identity will unfortunately be to no-one's benefit in the end. I do not believe that we want this divisiveness in Australia. What is more, Australians do not deserve it, and they do not deserve to be constantly accused of being a racially intolerant society, because Australia simply is not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be remembered that we are a nation of immigrants. Many of our forebears came here because they were forcibly displaced from their homes by events outside their control. It is a fact of history, mostly unfortunate, that people and peoples are overtaken by events outside their control. Such an event occurred when Europeans came to this land. From our European heritage we have formed one of the most tolerant, inclusive and decent countries of the world&mdash;with problems, certainly, but still the envy of almost all countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the happiest Aboriginal Australians are those who have taken the best that our society offers and maintained their commitment to their heritage. One has only to look at Evonne Goolagong, the Ella brothers or many Aboriginal Australians I know, to discover that happiness comes from being part of mainstream society, not standing apart from it. Complicating our system of land tenure will make helping the majority of indigenous Australians more difficult. One has only to look at the different classifications of land we now have in this country&mdash;ordinary land, which all Australians, including Aboriginals, can buy; land rights land; ATSIC land; Mabo land; and now land fund land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the issues I have raised, the bill itself is very deceptive indeed. We were originally told that over 10 years $1.5 billion would be spent out of the budget to buy land for Aboriginal Australians. We now find that only $24 million a year extra will be spent on purchasing land, on upgrading the land they already have and on the management of that land; only a fraction of it will be spent on purchasing land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this government were genuine it would take on board the coalition's amendments to change the focus of the bill to address health, housing, education and economic issues. These are the issues that average Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders wants addressed. Ideology means very little to them. The government has indicated that it will also reject our amendments to address accountability. Accountability is the key to good government and also to the Aboriginal and white communities having faith in this land fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must get on with the job and address issues that matter to all Australians, such as the enormous waste of talent in the 800,000 unemployed, our ballooning foreign debt and our increasing social dislocation and breakdown. The land fund, unfortunately, will not provide the dignity and respectability that I wish for Aboriginal Australians. The legislation tears at the very fabric of our egalitarian society. Now is the time for all Australians, our indigenous people and those whose forebears, like mine, came here from elsewhere, to recognise that we all belong here, that we are all Australians, that as Australians we need to help one another and that we eye the future, not punish and divide modern Australia for the wrongs done long ago&mdash;to punish ourselves, in Wordsworth's view, `for old, unhappy, far-off things and battles long ago'. Health, housing and education are the help that all of us need. They are the priorities. This package does not address those. </PARA>

What we did in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act which we passed in 1989 was to introduce legislation with a preamble which I will take a few minutes to read because, Mr Acting Deputy President, the sorts of things I will now read would be the sorts of things that you, for example, would agree with wholeheartedly. The preamble to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 begins by stating:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An Act to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission and an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commercial Development Corporation, and for related purposes.</PARA>
<PARA>The preamble goes on for about a page and a half. I will not read it, but I shall read part of it. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">WHEREAS the people of Australia voted overwhelmingly to amend the Constitution so that the Parliament of Australia would be able to make special laws for peoples of the aboriginal race;</PARA>
<PARA>You would remember that, Mr Acting Deputy President; you and I were both somewhat younger but no less wise than we are now. That was a great achievement in Australian history. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AND WHEREAS the people whose descendants are now known as Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders were the inhabitants of Australia before European settlement;</PARA>
<PARA>We set that out in this act which was passed by this parliament and was welcomed by all Australians. We put that into that particular legislation and nobody has ever attempted to take that out. The preamble continues:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AND WHEREAS they have been progressively dispossessed of their lands and this dispossession occurred largely without compensation, and successive governments have failed to reach a lasting and equitable agreement with Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders concerning the use of their lands;</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AND WHEREAS it is the intention of the people of Australia to make provision for rectification, by such measures as are agreed by the Parliament from time to time, including the measures referred to in this Act, of the consequences of past injustices and to ensure that Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders receive that full recognition within the Australian nation to which history, their prior rights and interests, and their rich and diverse culture, fully entitle them to aspire;</PARA>
<PARA>I have looked at the amendments put forward today but I have seen none that in any way tries to modify or abolish the preamble to the ATSIC Act, to which the present bill will be an amendment. There is no evidence for repealing that particular preamble. I take it from that that everybody in this chamber is agreeable to the sorts of sentiments set out in that preamble. If we are all in agreement with the preamble to the ATSIC Act, the present bill fits very properly into that act, and the sorts of things it seeks to obtain are the sorts of things that should properly be obtained in conformity with that preamble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I say in passing that the ATSIC plan is a monument to the former minister for Aboriginal affairs, Mr Gerry Hand. He laboured long and hard to get this particular legislation up. It is a pity that he has left the parliament but this is one of his great achievements.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy should not interrupt; he might learn something, as I am learning as I read this speech. The fact that Australia Post is widely seen as a high-performing company which delivers a world-class service seems to be totally irrelevant. The Industry Commission has decreed that there must be more competition, and so there will be. That is not to say that the Australian Democrats are opposed to competition which is aimed at increasing efficiency, improving customer service and restraining price rises. However, our concern is that Australians expect a letter service which is accessible to everyone on an equitable basis. That is why the standard letter service is nominated as a community service obligation in the act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As honourable senators are aware, Australia Post's community service obligation can only be met by requiring urban Australians to cross-subsidise the postal services for rural and remote areas. I do not accept the common wisdom which seems to suggest that these days cross-subsidisation is a dirty word. At present, the cross-subsidy is funded by reserving a slab of postal services to Australia Post to give it enough revenue to provide a low cost standard letter service to all. That approach has been continued with this bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fairness to the Industry Commission, it must be said that its report on postal services accepts the need for community service obligations. Indeed, it argues that the community service obligations to remote areas should be strengthened to guarantee everyone two deliveries per week. The Democrats endorse that recommendation and believe that it is probably the most important one made by the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where we part company from the commission is over how community service obligations should be funded. As a matter of principle, the commission believes that community service obligations should be funded by the taxpayer from consolidated revenue. This would set the scene for its preferred option of full competition in the supply of postal services. The Democrats take the view that if it is not broken, do not try to fix it. Australia Post is not perfect, but it is widely seen as a high-performing public utility. Efficiency and customer service have improved markedly in recent years and prices have been kept down. The upheaval which would be visited on Australia Post by full deregulation is not justified by the advances it has made. It would be a poor reward for staff&mdash;</PARA>

This agreement stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be full public disclosure of all information related to the proposal and its environmental impact.</PARA>
<PARA>However, very little information has been released despite repeated requests from conservationists. We would like to see things such as the environmental management agreement which was signed by the Cardwell Shire Council, the Queensland government and the developer, Keith Williams. This is the same environmental management agreement which the Queensland government and Keith Williams have been boasting has the tightest environmental controls. But how can we believe them when they do not publicly release it so that we can be assured?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only major piece of information relating to the environmental impact of the proposal was the environment review report, which was released by the Queensland government on 2 May and which had as its author, quite mysteriously, the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government does not have sufficient information to adequately quantify all potential impacts of such a project in the area.</PARA>

This evening I want to read from a letter in reply to Mr Williams from the Office of the Co-ordinator General dated 21 April 1994 in which there are 11 pages of amendments sent to Mr Williams for his approval. On that list of amendments there are many written notations made by either Mr Williams or his staff. These notations and the amendments are very revealing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly do not have time to read them all, but let me give the Senate some examples. This letter is titled `Port Hinchinbrook Environment Review Report'. At the beginning of the letter the writer says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your comments and requests have been examined in detail and the following changes made to the document:</PARA>
<PARA>One of the changes is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The words "with limited tidal and weather access" have been added to the end of the sentence `there is a jetty at Cardwell'.</PARA>
<PARA>The comment which is written on the amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elimination of the necessity for dredging the jetty channel will offset any negative impact caused by dredging the proposed marina channel.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Williams wants to ensure that his development will be seen in the best possible light. Turning to page 3 of the amendments, under the heading `water quality' the Office of the Co-ordinator General wrote this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A new sentence has been inserted to follow the first sentence, as follows: "Stormwater and irrigation effluent may also impact on marina water quality and the Hinchinbrook Channel.</PARA>
<PARA>We would certainly agree. Mr Williams has crossed all that out and written:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not acceptable.</PARA>
<PARA>At the top of page 4 under the heading `final paragraph' the writer of the amendments says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Comment noted.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Williams or one of his staff has inserted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I insist on my comment being included because it is truthful.</PARA>
<PARA>On page 7 of the amendments there is quite a long passage which speaks about the developer ensuring that stormwater drainage is diverted away from the marina and that sewerage effluent is discharged to ensure that the run-off from the resort grounds and effluent irrigation areas do not cause contamination of stormwater et cetera. All of that is crossed out and Mr Williams or a member of his staff has inserted these words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quality of water in the marina is of vital importance to the developer and assurance has been given that all practical steps will be taken to ensure that nutrient build up will be minimised.</PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that Mr Williams would prefer that comment to the much stronger comment in the amendments. So we go on. On page 11 some words that I cannot read have been crossed out, but the comment from Mr Williams or a member of his staff is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under no circumstances will I agree to this.</PARA>
<PARA>Surely the Senate can understand the concern we have about the supposed independence of the Queensland government's environmental review report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could read on and perhaps put into the record a comment by Mr Williams which appeared in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> in a column called `Monitor at Large' on 30 March 1991. The article refers to the author attending a party at which Mr Williams:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">had built up a fine head of steam, and he had an interesting, new solution to the nation's problems and deficiencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He told me: "I think I should be appointed dictator."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the State?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"No, of the whole country. Just me, and my army."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">And some public servants?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Not for long. Once I got my army, I don't think there would be much left of the public service."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Well I never.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the Senate can understand why many people are so concerned about this development and still have so many questions to ask of the Queensland government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Employment, Education and Training has provided the following answers to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Revised Jobstart subsidy rates and durations were announced on 4 May 1994 in the Government's Working Nation White Paper. The Government substantially increased subsidies for those out of work the longest and reduced rates for those out of work for shorter periods. These changes recognise that in periods of economic recovery, those out of work for short periods need less assistance to return to work while additional assistance is required to ensure that the long term unemployed are able to compete for jobs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) All CES offices were advised about the exact changes to the Jobstart subsidy rates and durations immediately following the release of Working Nation on 4 May 1994. The new Jobstart rates came into effect on 4 July 1994. Up to this time the previous rates remained current.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) There were no legislative changes associated with the variations in Jobstart subsidies which came into effect on 4 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Jobstart Self Canvassing Cards are issued to eligible jobseekers to assist them in getting a job. The Cards inform potential employers that a wage subsidy may be available. It does not commit the Commonwealth to a particular level of subsidy. Cards are issued for a three month period and identify the rates and durations of subsidy which apply at the time Cards are issued. The actual rates that would be payable when a jobseeker finds employment may vary from that shown on the card for a number of reasons (including, for example, when a person moves to a higher rate of subsidy). Therefore, the Cards clearly identify that the employer must contact the CES to confirm eligibility for a subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Jobstart Self Canvassing Cards are an aid which jobseekers can use to assist themselves in securing employment. They do not contain commitments to pay particular levels of Jobstart subsidy. The Cards clearly state that to be eligible to receive a Jobstart subsidy the employer must always contact the local CES to confirm eligibility and to complete an agreement with the CES before the jobseeker starts work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) As pointed out in the answer to question three, rates of subsidy can vary from that shown on the card.

The National Training Wage forms the basis for the significant expansion of training and entry level places for young Australians set out and funded through Working Nation. This Award represents a partnership approach on the part of Government, industry and the trade union movement which has the interests of the unemployed, particularly the young and long term unemployed, at its centre. The Award provides for a streamlining of the traineeship system on an industry basis with a simplified wage structure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management of some Commonwealth properties has been devolved to occupant departments, such as the Department of Defence or to Government Business Enterprises such as the Federal Airports Corporation. Therefore, at present, there is no central coordinating agency able to give a decision on all Commonwealth properties in relation to this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In practice under a devolved management system, farmers seeking access to Commonwealth-owned land for stock agistment purposes would usually contact the relevant occupying government agency directly through their respective regional administration offices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The normal approach taken to the management of broadacre sites, such as Defence bases and major airports, which may have substantial grassed areas on the property is to put in place either a grazing licence or a grass cutting contract. This is part of ongoing maintenance of such properties and is essential to reduce the risk of fire.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On major Defence bases, a grazing licence is usually the best option as it ensures the fire risk is reduced and also generates a small amount of revenue for the Commonwealth. Where grazing licences are in place, availability of the land for grazing by other than the licensed grazier would naturally be reduced or precluded entirely. Approaches for emergency agistment measures would be treated on a case by case basis taking Defence needs and land management requirements into account.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On properties such as airports, or properties contiguous to airports, management would usually arrange a grasscutting contract, since the presence of grazing animals could contribute to an increased bird presence and a consequential increased likelihood of bird strikes on aeroplanes. Such contracts nommally allow for the grasscutter to cut and bale the grass and sell up to a specified limit to cover his costs. Baled grass over and above that limit may be sold on behalf of the Commonwealth, although, in the past it has been donated to drought affected areas. A recent example of this was grass baled at the former Brisbane Airport and Floodway area being transported to drought affected areas.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I expect that Commonwealth Government agencies would be well aware of the difficulties facing drought affected fammers at present and stand willing to assist where they can. For example, within the Administrative Services portfolio, Australian Estate Management Regional Managers have been instructed to look at the opportunities in their regions to help drought affected farmers by donating grass or by making properties available for grazing.</PARA>
