<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, representing the Prime Minister. I ask: what did Mr Keating mean yesterday when he said that in the last Iraqi conflict with Saddam Hussein `we should have finished him off'? Is this the same Mr Keating who, according to Senator Evans's former leader, Mr Hawke, opposed Australia's involvement by saying&mdash;and I quote from the Hawke book&mdash;`What has the US done for us?' Does this not now demonstrate not only embarrassing diplomacy but also revisionist history with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1389" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a pretty cheap collection of shots from Senator Hill, as one would expect, trying to make squalid political capital out of a very serious international affair that is unfolding at the moment in circumstances that are a matter of concern to us all. Whatever might have been said in the rough and tumble of events back in 1991&mdash;and I cannot remember what Mr Keating may have said on that particular issue in the course of the discussions which took place&mdash;it bears no resemblance whatsoever, has no relevance whatsoever, to the circumstance as it now exists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is that then, as now, this government acted in support of the gulf coalition because of the way in which it was run not as a unilateral exercise by any country advancing its own national interest but rather as part of a full-scale international effort under the full authority of the United Nations with the full support of the entire international community. It was not a situation then or now that can be characterised as a United States operation, any more than the kind of reaction that is developing in the international community now to the threatened re-escalation of this conflict could be construed as simply a United States response.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a clearly a mood to ensure that there is no repetition of the unhappy events of 1990 when Iraq did manage to invade Kuwait, taking the world unawares and its neighbour unawares as it did so. Nobody wants to see a repetition of that. Indeed, in all the circumstances of this situation as it is now unfolding it does appear that the response of the international community has been so swift and so decisive, and the messages given have been so clear, that it is unlikely that the situation will deteriorate further. That should be an occasion for congratulations and enthusiasm by the opposition, not cheap party point scoring of the kind it is trying to engage in now.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The cheap political points were clearly on the side of Mr Keating yesterday, who obviously wanted to take benefit from the success of the gulf coalition. But I am surprised that the minister cannot remember what occurred at that time because, according to Bob Hawke, Senator Evans actually contributed to this exchange. When Mr Keating said that he did not want to participate and said, `What has the US done for us?' Bob Hawke said, `I was quick to point out, as was Gareth, that we were acting to back the UN, not the US.'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is this: has Senator Evans had a word to the Prime Minister about his undiplomatic contribution yesterday and suggested that it is not in Australia's best interests? Perhaps with the benefit of revisionist hindsight, can we expect the Prime Minister to be a little more constructive in this instance than he was on the last occasion?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not occur to me to have a word with the Prime Minister of the kind that is being suggested to me by Senator Hill, because I have no quarrel at all with what the Prime Minister said yesterday. He responded to the situation as he saw it unfolding with a clear demonstration and a clear statement of the kind of support that could be expected for the international community from Australia should this situation deteriorate to the point where conflict might occur. We all hope that that will not happen. But if it does, and if a UN mandated response is in fact agreed by the international community, Australia could reasonably be expected to be part of that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the essence of what Mr Keating was saying yesterday. I certainly have no quarrel with that, and I do not think anyone else in the Australian community would have any quarrel with it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Trade. In light of the recent concerns expressed about some aspects of the Uruguay Round results, and with the implementation date of the agreement approaching, what will the successful ratification of the Uruguay Round legislation mean for Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1390" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does seem that everyone who has a favourite issue anywhere in the world has locked onto the GATT these days and the outcome of the Uruguay Round to typecast it as the source of the particular evil that is their primary concern. Recently we have heard in Australian media and other commentaries suggestions that the Uruguay Round result will do everything from worsening the plight of women in Ethiopia to making Australian labelling of Australian products illegal and preventing the conducting of a `Buy Australian' campaign. All the rumours in the world are being run. They are fundamentally inaccurate, they demonstrate a very poor understanding of what the agreement is all about, and they fail to take into account, for example, what it will mean for jobs for Australians and jobs for people in other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Uruguay Round will result in long-term major boosts to the Australian economy across all sections of industry&mdash;mining, agriculture, manufacturing services and jobs for Australians right across the board. In the absence of the Round, we would lose about $5 billion of exports, about $4.4 billion of GDP and the unemployment would be about one per cent higher than it otherwise would be. I do not know why anybody would think that is a good outcome; I do not know why anybody would be advocating that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If you want to oppose the GATT, you should not come here. You should go down to Leeton and tell the rice growers that they should not get access to the Japanese market.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking to the Deputy President. That is my responsibility and I would always do that, of course. It is very important to make those points clear. There are also concerns about the impact on developing countries. Yet the two industries of greatest importance to developing countries are textiles and agriculture, and they both make significant gains in terms of market access for producers of textiles and agriculture.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us talk about two of the specifics&mdash;first, the wonderful story that it will worsen the plight of Ethiopian women.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put another furphy to rest. There is a story about&mdash;it was on the ABC radio here in Canberra, to my great chagrin&mdash;that the GATT and the Uruguay Round will in some way stop us labelling Australian products so that we can identify them and that somehow it will stop us running `Buy Australian' campaigns. That is absolutely untrue. There is no way that anything in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will impact upon our capacity to label goods in this way or to promote `Buy Australian' campaigns to our heart's content. So let us not try to undermine the GATT by these sorts of campaigns. The last thing we want to do is to undermine something that could make unemployment one per cent higher than it would otherwise be.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. Given all of those things, will the delay in the United States congressional vote on the Uruguay Round legislation mean that it could fail to be ratified by the United States? What are the implications of that for Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1390" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important question. Many Australians who are potential beneficiaries are concerned about the delays in the United States' consideration of this matter. In the Jakarta trade ministers meeting last week the deputy United States trade representative made it clear that her view was that the legislation would pass the House on 29 November and the Senate on 1 December and that there would be a comfortable majority. While we would prefer that it not be delayed, we have to note that it is probable that it will pass the United States Congress before it passes the Australian parliament because our timetable will finish slightly later than 1 December.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is nobody's fault. They are both perfectly ample times. I am simply saying that a lot of people are concerned about the timetable. I am trying to put it in context. There is no fault in either case. We greatly support what the Clinton administration has tried to do in getting the legislation through Congress. We hope it will be successful. When the Congress re-convenes after the election it will be the existing Congress and all the indications are that there should be a majority. It is important for Australia that the legislation be passed and for that reason we have been working very hard to build up a consensus of support for it. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer the minister to his recent appointments and reappointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal. Firstly, is the minister aware of allegations, supported apparently by affidavit, of corrupt dealings by one of the Victorian reappointees, Mr Joe Italiano, and if so, what action does he propose to take? Secondly, can he explain to the Senate the reasons for appointing to the IRT two preselected Labor Party candidates for the next Victorian state election, Mr Garth Head and Ms Lyn Kosky, and for reappointing an already preselected candidate, Mr Joe Italiano? Thirdly, can he also explain the reasons for reappointing Mr Tony Labbozzetta, a member of the ALP, to the IRT in New South Wales despite his having sat on only four cases in the last four years and having made only one decision in that four-year period?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some of this information, some of this scuttlebutt, around the place. I suppose that I, in a sense, have been sickened by it. We have found that there has been the degradation of people's reputations under parliamentary privilege by the other side in the Victorian parliament. Senator Short raised the question of Mr Italiano. I have written to Mr Cooper, the person in the Victorian parliament who raised these allegations under parliamentary privilege, and said to him, `If you have got something, we would like to see it. Please provide it and we will act on it.' I say to Senator Short that I think the matters raised about Mr Italiano were raised some six or seven years ago. They had no legs then; if they have got legs now, then obviously we will have a look at them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does Senator Short no good to drag up a case and, under the protection which he has but which the person concerned does not have, raise allegations about criminality. If Senator Short has got something, he should put it up or shut up. That is what I have said to Mr Cooper and that is what I say to Senator Short.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the other people, I have seen in recent days as well that I have been criticised for appointing people with party affiliation. In that context, I have discovered that I have appointed someone with a Liberal Party affiliation to the IRT. I refer to Ms Kosky and Ms Dollis. Those two people were assessed by an assessment panel. Kosky and Dollis were recommended to me for appointment, and it would have been against any&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Short did not ask about Dollis but she is a person who has been raised as well. I raise it in the context of the slur that Senator Short is trying to raise about political appointments. They were assessed by the panel, they were very highly recommended and I proceeded with those appointments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Italiano was also recommended for appointment. He was assessed positively and he was also appointed. My point is that a number of people applied for these jobs. The jobs were advertised, a list of people was assessed by a panel, that panel made recommendations to me and, in many of those instances, I accepted their recommendations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This process has, in my mind, been geared by a number of imperatives: first, to find the best possible people for the job; secondly, to rely on and draw from a diverse group; and, thirdly, to maintain the independence of this particular body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I say to honourable senators in that context&mdash;in relation to appointments to both the IRT and the RRT, the Refugee Review Tribunal&mdash;that I have gone out of my way to ensure that the people appointed are independent of any influence from me and from the department. For that reason, we have come up with a very diverse batch of people, both here and in terms of the RRT. In fact, Senator Short at some stage in estimates committees reflected on the appointments to the RRT. The same principles apply. I want to see people in these positions who are not beholden either to me or to the immigration department&mdash;and that is what we have here. I am quite happy with the talent of the people appointed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to a couple of those reflected on by Senator Short&mdash;Italiano and Head. My information from the tribunal is that these people, who have been appointed for some time, particularly Italiano, have been performing extremely well. I would rather judge people on their performance and on their promise rather than blackguard them because of some political affiliation that Senator Short would like to draw on in a very unfair way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. I cannot thank the minister for his complete non-answer, but I pick up a couple of his points. He said that all the positions filled were advertised. Is it a fact that one of the preselected ALP candidates, Mr Garth Head, was appointed in December 1993&mdash;out of the normal term of appointments&mdash;and that the position to which he was appointed was not advertised? What were the reasons for that? As there is now a noticeable stench surrounding several of the IRT appointments that Senator Bolkus has made, and the reappointments&mdash;and, I might add, the non-reappointment of Victorian principal member Michael Clothier, who has been replaced by a former Labor party staffer without a law degree&mdash;will the minister urgently re-examine his complete non-answer yesterday to my questions on notice and come clean that the real reasons for many of his appointments are nothing other than jobs for his Labor mates?</PARA></TALK.START>

Can the minister advise us whether he has received any preliminary advice on this matter?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have, and I stress that it is preliminary advice. Commonwealth officials are now embarked on a far more detailed examination in a national audit in cooperation with the state authorities. Organisations such as the National Farmers Federation and the Grains Council of Australia are already urgently examining the situation as well. Our preliminary audit has indicated that wheat stocks will be sufficient to cover domestic wheat demands until the 1994-95 crop becomes available. Even allowing for around two million tonnes of exports, and that is going on the most pessimistic forecast for crop production, we will have enough grain in aggregate&mdash;and I stress aggregate&mdash;to meet all of our domestic food and feed requirements. But this is not the situation on the ground. That is simply to do with total tonnages.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be significant grain shortfalls in the states of Queensland and New South Wales. These will have to be met by imports from Western Australia, South Australia, Victoria, and without question in some cases from overseas. The importation of some of the higher quality wheats, such as durum wheat, will have to be considered. Applications have already been received for around 130,000 tonnes of durum wheat to be imported. Those applications are currently being considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importation in some circumstances of feed grain also is, in my view, a sensible option that will have to be considered as part of a national strategy to ensure regional grain shortages are met in the most efficient and, I stress, cost-effective way possible. It will make more sense in some circumstances for high quality grain from Western Australia suitable for premium prices in exports to be used for that rather than using it as feed grain when feed grain can be imported at a lower cost.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Applications for the import of 120,000 tonnes of sorghum and 10,000 tonnes of maize have already been approved. I must say that I am profoundly disappointed that the ever worsening drought has caused the situation to reach this stage. Clearly, imports have to be considered now as the most efficient and cost-effective way, in some circumstances, of tackling the problem of feed shortages, especially as some domestic prices are now above import parity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress, however, that AQIS is working closely with grain users and in close consultation with the Grains Council of Australia to develop effective quarantine protocols to facilitate such trade, while retaining&mdash;as we must&mdash;our quarantine integrity. The Australian Wheat Board and state grain marketers are managing supplies to ensure that domestic demand is met. Shipments of grain from South Australia and Western Australia to the eastern states are already taking place. ABARE is planning a special crop report for release in early November to update figures for the winter crop grain production. This would normally have been released in December.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is to the Minister for Trade. The minister has made a lot of claims here today about the big benefits for Australia of free trade. He might be right in the long run, but what answer does he give to the claims made at the Women, Power and Politics Conference by Canadian economist Professor Marjorie Griffin Cohen that free trade agreements and the opening up of world markets were `dangerous to women and other disadvantaged groups'? What answer does he give to her claim that the wishes of people, as expressed through the actions of elected democratic governments, are being superseded by international trade rules? I am not saying that Australia should stand aside from this. I am saying: how can you or anybody else be sure at the moment that the present international economic order will not create growing gender inequity and the loss of civilised society, as many women at the conference fear? The minister might laugh, but some people do not place blind trust in everything.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was smiling only because I was hoping to get the question. One thing that is true is that nobody can guarantee that the benefits of free trade will be fairly distributed in the societies. It may well be that women will in some instances not gain a fair share of the benefits in Australia, Canada or anywhere else. Nobody can guarantee within the countries in question how the benefits will flow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say that I thought Professor Griffin Cohen's arguments left a bit to be desired. She was, for example, concerned about the great loss of jobs in Canada. That does not accord with the statistics that I have seen. But, even if that were true, it would only be because there is a big upsurge of jobs in Mexico. That is the first problem with Senator Kernot's argument.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second problem is that all Professor Griffin Cohen's concerns relate to NAFTA. Nobody made Canada join NAFTA. Canada made a sovereign decision to join. We have had a free trade agreement for a very long time with New Zealand. None of those adverse implications have followed because of the nature of the agreement. If I might say so, the reason that they have not is that we have not tried to hang off CER all sorts of social and other elements, which is what the Australian Democrats continually seek to do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because CER does not have all of those bells and whistles, it does not have all of those consequential implications. CER has been a significant net plus for both countries. There is a great advantage: CER does not have any of those restrictions. There is nothing in any free trade agreement that Australia has joined or is contemplating joining that would have the sorts of consequences that Professor Griffin Cohen has said.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the assessments I have seen I think it is highly unlikely that NAFTA will have those consequences, but that is a matter for Mexico, the United States and Canada. They all chose to join, and they negotiated the terms and conditions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Industry, Science and Technology, Senator Cook. I refer to the release yesterday of two surveys on the prospects of the Australian manufacturing industry, one conducted by the Australian Chamber of Manufactures and the other by the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales and the State Bank of New South Wales. I am sure that senators will be pleased to note that the surveys revealed a very positive outlook for growth in both manufacturing output and employment over the next 12 months. They also show that confidence in the manufacturing sector is very high. While these overall results are encouraging, can the minister confirm whether the expectations of future growth are spread across the diverse range of manufacturing activities? Can the minister also comment on how these findings sit with the government's forecast for economic growth, particularly in relation to jobs growth and inflationary expectations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably another set of figures should be entered into the debate as well. Yesterday, the ANZ bank published its survey of job advertisements in Australia for the month of September this year. It showed an increase in seasonally adjusted terms of job vacancies in Australia of four per cent, offsetting a one per cent decline in August. The job vacancies index rose by 12.1 per cent for the September quarter, off the back of an 8.6 per cent rise for the June quarter, showing consistent levels of job vacancies arising in the Australian economy. In a year on year comparison it showed that vacancies this year are at a level of 48 per cent higher than they were at the same time last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me now turn to the two surveys of manufacturing activity referred to in the question. The Australian Chamber of Manufactures survey shows that nationally manufacturers are predicting their strongest December quarter for five years, with 91 per cent of firms surveyed expecting to maintain or increase production. In fact, it shows positive trends in all seven key growth indicators. It shows upward trends in production, in sales, in orders, in exports, in profits, in investment, and in employment. It is particularly pleasing that this growth is expected to translate almost immediately into job opportunities as well.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both surveys anticipate that some 6,000 jobs will be generated in the manufacturing sector in Australia over the next 12 months. These figures come off a very high base indeed. Forty-three per cent of manufacturers surveyed increased their production in the September quarter. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, manufacturing production rose by 8.3 per cent in 1993-94&mdash;the strongest yearly growth since the ABS series began.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The surveys show as well that this growth in production is likely to be translated into further export growth, with 32 per cent of firms surveyed expecting to increase their export sales in the December quarter&mdash;again, off a high base. Volumes of manufactured exports have been increasing at an average of 9.9 per cent year on year every year since 1986-87. A recent study by the Centre for Strategic Economic Studies in Victoria shows that exports of elaborately transformed manufactured goods&mdash;the most complex manufactured goods&mdash;have been growing over recent years at a rate of 20.4 per cent a year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Allan Handberg, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Chamber of Manufactures, drew special attention to the continued strong growth in our exports just recently. It shows that manufactures are not simply switching back to the domestic market as the pace of economic growth maintains its momentum.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was asked: is this growth going to be shared across industry sectors? The answer to that question is yes&mdash;with expectations strongest in the chemical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, printing, motor vehicles, food, beverages and textile industries. The strong trends are spread across all 12 key manufacturing sectors and across all states of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was also asked: what impact will this growth have on inflationary expectations? As manufacturing production reaches capacity constraints, one could expect some pressure on input costs, and this has been signalled. However, the survey of the Chamber of Manufactures of New South Wales and the most recent ACCI Westpac survey conclude that inflationary pressures remain under control. In particular, they point to the fact that growth in new investment and strong competition within the manufacturing sector itself will keep pressure off prices. That is borne out by the survey findings.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5K4">Senator FAULKNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Better, in fact, than at many other conferences I have been at. I am aware of the statements that Mr Richardson has made, and I can say to the Senate, through you, Mr Deputy President, that they are groundless. I think they are mischievous statements. They are certainly statements that, I believe, are out of step with many of his union colleagues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I did publicly announce in a speech I made in Hobart at the ALP national conference that I am currently looking at how plantations can play a role in relieving pressure on native forests while, at the same time, offering significant expansion of the industry's resource base. To this end, I have recently agreed to fund a national plantation study. The study is fully consistent with the national forest policy statement and will involve state and territory conservation councils. I believe it will be significant in progressing the NFPS goals of the full utilisation and expansion of Australia's plantation resource and the NFPS objectives in relation to the development of plantation based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study will develop an aggregate national overview of the plantation estate, involving the identification of the extent of hardwood and softwood plantations in each state, opportunities for processing this resource, industry expansion opportunities, employment potential and also Commonwealth actions to stimulate an increased emphasis on plantation resource utilisation. It is designed to provide a picture of the extent of the plantation resource nationwide and will identify specific development opportunities which could enjoy the support of both industry and conservation groups. It will also provide the Commonwealth with information on the potential for the ecologically sustainable expansion of industry and employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study does differ substantially from the National Plantations Advisory Committee work, which primarily focused on the development and establishment of new plantations on cleared agricultural land. It also differs from the work of the Resource Assessment Commission, which undertook financial feasibility assessments for possible expansion of the plantation estate and studies that detailed the area of land suitable for new plantation development. This study, by contrast, will focus on the extent of existing plantation estate and will examine means to fully utilise that resource. The consultant who is coordinating the study has already had very positive feedback about the study from industry sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A study proposal from Environment Victoria entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">National Plantations: Environment, Industry Development and Employment</EMPHASIS> was first submitted to my department in June of last year. A revised proposal, which was redrafted to fit more directly within the funding guidelines of the environment portfolio, was submitted in February 1994. On 1 April I received that revised study proposal with the recommendation from my department that funding should be granted for the study. I did, however, withhold further action until July, pending receipt of Environment Victoria's audited financial statement for the grants to voluntary conservation organisations program for 1993-94 and until questions raised by Mr Barry Cunningham on the extent of departmental funding to the organisation were answered. I believe this study will provide a basis for greater dialogue on plantation issues between industry, union and conservation interests. I think this is very important to the environment debate in this country.</PARA>

I refer her to the report entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red alert</EMPHASIS> which has been put together over some years by Catherine Beauchamp, acting from the Centre for National Corporate Law Research at the University of Canberra. I ask the minister: has CSL been importing human blood or blood derived materials, such as plasma, from other countries for use in the preparation of products for human use? If so, where and by whom were these imported materials tested for infectious agents, and were donors being screened? If reliance was placed on foreign testing, did any of these products come from countries where hepatitis C or other infectious diseases are common? If so, were these products re-tested in Australia before being pooled with Australian derived blood or blood products? Finally, is it possible that infected product found its way onto the Australian or overseas markets as a consequence of slackness in ensuring sterility?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In reply to that question, I can provide the following information. CSL does bring into Australia plasma from other countries to manufacture blood products for human use in those countries. However, the plasma that comes in is not pooled with Australian plasma or the plasma from other countries. What comes in stays as a separate unit for the treatment and then is sent out again. The products are then returned to the country of origin. To be clear, there is absolutely no pooling of any of that blood. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> CSL currently brings into Australia plasma for manufacturing blood products from New Zealand, Hong Kong, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia, for their respective use.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Department of Human Services and Health provides policy advice and assists AQIS in discharging its responsibilities in relation to human quarantine. Until early 1993, AQIS referred all import applications for those biological materials that could pose a possible human health risk to the Department of Human Services and Health for advice on appropriate controls to be applied in each instance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An internal review of human quarantine in controlling the importation of biological materials took place in late 1992. As a result of that, human quarantine, it was agreed, should only be directed or concerned with a limited number of human disease agents and vectors or hosts that are of distinct quarantine concern. Since the implementation of these recommendations, AQIS routinely processes most import applications for biological materials without reference to human quarantine, and in accordance with the standard protocol agreed between AQIS and Human Services and Health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief on this first one. The simple fact is that no member of the opposition was given the courtesy by the government of being invited to be a member of the delegation to the Cairo conference. It is true that the Presiding Officers asked all members and senators whether they wanted to go. Partly as a response to that, Senators Bourne, Reynolds and Harradine, who said they would like to go, were stuck on the delegation later on. But there was no proper process and no courtesy given by inviting any member to be a member of that delegation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly take note of Senator Bolkus's reply to my question today concerning his recent appointments, reappointments and non-reappointments to the Immigration Review Tribunal. My question followed the minister's response yesterday to questions I had placed on notice on 25 August about these matters. Just as he did in his response to my questions on notice, Senator Bolkus today totally failed to provide reasons for his appointments of several people who would not, on the face of it, appear to be appropriate persons for these positions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather, the appointments appear to have been made for purely political reasons: to find jobs for Labor apparatchiks or Labor Party candidates for the next state election in Victoria. No fewer than three of the IRT appointees in Victoria&mdash;two new appointees and one a reappointment&mdash;are Labor Party candidates for the next state election. Two of them&mdash;Mr Garth Head and Ms Lyn Kosky&mdash;were appointed when they were already pre-selected candidates. The third&mdash;Joe Italiano&mdash;who had previously worked for a senior Labor Party politician in Victoria, Ian Baker, was pre-selected after his appointment as a member of the IRT. Despite that, he apparently took no steps to resign his position, as I thought would have been proper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same Mr Joe Italiano has been accused in the Victorian parliament of corrupt dealings on migration matters. I make no accusations on this point. I do not know the facts but I am aware that the accusations are supported by affidavits and that those affidavits are in fact in the possession of a Labor Party Victorian member of parliament. As far as Mr Garth Head is concerned, I am advised that the position to which he was appointed last December was not advertised, despite claims by the minister today that all positions were advertised. If my advice is correct, the minister clearly has misled the Senate today and must be brought to account for that. First, he must give an explanation as to why he has, as I understand it, misled the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another extraordinary appointment is that of Ms Michelle Scott as the principal IRT member in Victoria. She was appointed to this position from South Australia. She was previously on the staff of a Labor politician in Western Australia. She does not have a law degree. She is the only principal member of any state not to have a law degree. She replaced as principal member an acknowledged expert on migration law, a person with vast experience in these areas, Mr Michael Clothier. Again, there has been no explanation for these seemingly extraordinary appointments and non-appointments. </PARA>

I understand he is known as the phantom member&mdash;and for good reason. Mr Labbozzetta has been on the IRT for four years. During that time he has sat on only four cases, and on only one of those was a decision made. Worse still, all four cases were heard in 1991-92.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to express the greatest of concerns about what has been revealed by my colleague Senator Short which follows some comments in the press about appointments to the IRT. I wish to put a number of specific questions to Senator Bolkus that I would like him to respond to. I have before me a list of IRT appointments which have been made by Senator Bolkus. A very high proportion of these people are ALP selected candidates, former ALP staffers or others who have extremely close associations with the Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bolkus said in response to Senator Short that these appointments were made from a very wide range of people. I ask Senator Bolkus how it is possible that so many of these appointments have such close Labor Party associations. My second question is: what is the process by which these people are appointed? Who are the people who make recommendations to Senator Bolkus?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am mindful of a problem which emerged in the Victorian government. When Attorney-General Wade was asked how people were appointed to various tribunals under the former Labor government, her department said that it had no idea how they were appointed. The Attorney-General just gave the department a list, a list which was presumably prepared by the Labor Party. I think Senator Bolkus now has to assure this parliament and the Australian public just what the process is by which these people are proposed and then appointed to the IRT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third question is a specific question relating to an individual. Senator Bolkus, in making his recent appointments, has refused to reaffirm the appointment, for example, of Mr Michael Clothier. Why was Mr Anthony Labbozetta also reappointed when he has apparently made two decisions in five years? How could that have happened? Does Senator Bolkus approve of Mr Labbozetta's specific performance?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think that what we are seeing here is the unfolding of a potentially major scandal.

I think it is important that Senator Bolkus stand up and explains to us how these things could have happened. Maybe there is an explanation for this. I think it is most unlikely, but maybe there is an explanation why so many Labor people are able to find their way onto the IRT. Unless Senator Bolkus's explanation is satisfactory, unless he can convince this parliament and the public that people have been appointed on a fair basis and unless he can assure the parliament about the independence of the IRT, we are facing a major scandal here. </PARA>

When the appointments to that tribunal were made, certain members of the opposition attacked certain appointees to the Refugee Review Tribunal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), to a question without notice asked by Senator Troeth this day, relating to the accreditation of child care centres.</PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed regrettable that Senator Crowley chose to indulge in personal abuse of those who dare to question the government's accreditation process. I would like to remind her and the government that very real concerns are being raised about the whole accreditation process at the moment by parents and child-care centres. This has been borne out by meetings that I have attended in both Queensland and Sydney, as well as other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real concerns which are being raised by those parents and proprietors of the child-care centres involve, among other things, the costs of child-care accreditation&mdash;this was raised in both Queensland and Adelaide. The costs, as witnessed by the figures that I raised in my question to Senator Crowley, have now been estimated at $25 extra per week per place instead of the 88c per week per place that was first put forward by Senator Crowley during debate last December. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the meeting I attended in Queensland last month, the audience of child-care proprietors was evenly divided over whether or not the accreditation costs would significantly add to their costs of maintaining their centres. The conclusion that those people came to was that, if those costs did occur, they would have to be passed on to the parents, thereby causing those parents to pay more for their child care. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the other problems that have been raised with me by parents and child-care proprietors include the staff time that will be absorbed in administration of the accreditation process and therefore less time devoted to children. For instance, parents commented on the fact that there was less change and variety in children's pictures on the walls because staff now had to spend a great deal more time preparing paper work to deal with accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only that, it has been pointed out by many commentators&mdash;one of whom was Jackie Lacy from the Australian Consumers Association who spoke at the recent EPAC child-care conference in Canberra&mdash;that there is a serious deficiency in child-care services in rural and remote areas. Families in those areas simply do not have neighbours or, indeed, in many cases, extended families with whom they can entrust the care of their children while they need to perform other necessary tasks. Neither do they have access to child-care places, and that is an aspect that will have to be looked at very closely by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ann Sherry, the former assistant secretary of the Office of the Status of Women, made the following comment at the recent EPAC conference on child care:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If banks were treating consumers in the same way that a lot of consumers feel they are being treated by children's services, we would be out on the streets.</PARA>
<PARA>The children's services area is simply not being provided for by the government. Not only that, Jackie Lacy, the speaker from the Australian Consumers Association to whom I referred earlier, talked about `inadequate or inappropriate hours' and claimed that the system was not keeping pace with changes in work patterns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In modern day Australia, we have not as much nine to five work. We have rotating shift work, casual work, on-call work and occasional work. The recent employment statistics show that the turnaround in jobs in recent months is largely in the area of part-time female casual work. The statistics also show that women are still responsible for the arranging of child care, yet they cannot get child-care hours to suit them. Workers need access to child care that matches their needs and work patterns, otherwise we will continue to lose skilled workers from industries. That was shown in a recent Victorian survey. It estimated that half of all respondents indicated that they had been more than one hour late for work or had left more than one hour early because of difficulties with child-care arrangements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to reply to some of those claims made by Senator Troeth&mdash;particularly to the emphasis that suggests our child-care program is in total disarray. It is anything but. Since we came into office, we have increased child-care places from 46,000 to more than 240,000. We have seen a rapid extension of child-care assistance to keep child care affordable, not only for people in the community based sector but also for people using the private centres. That has happened since 1991, with a dramatic increase in places. We introduced the accreditation program, which has seen a national program for quality across all the long-day care centres in this country, except those like Mrs Young's that are not yet prepared to come within the fold.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that Senator Troeth said was that I claimed that it cost 88c per child per week; that the cost of this program is very confused; and that South Australian figures now suggest that the cost is $25. I simply refute that again. If Senator Troeth has a look at the details of those figures&mdash;and I suspect that she may have&mdash;she should know, but perhaps she does not, that many of the things that are counted in those costs are matters of state licensing regulations, and they are not part of accreditation. They may be costs that centres have to introduce, but they must not be sheeted home to the accreditation process. That is the distinction we have been drawing all along: a distinction that most people fail to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Certainly, I think what is important about the South Australian figures is that they were provided with the best intentions in the world and with the intention of trying to find out. This is the very best of what accreditation programs are about&mdash;when centres and the government, or the accreditation council, can work together to make clear which costs properly belong to accreditation and which do not. Those are the sorts of things that most centres are finding of great assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that people in South Australia are not being fierce or adamant. Their assessment is that the cost comes to $25. My assessment&mdash;and I have only roughly looked at it, but it is the more accurate assessment&mdash;makes it clear that some of the things that they are including in that $25 assessed extra cost do not belong to accreditation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of those things is the cost of providing information on noticeboards for parents. That is costly in terms of hours used by staff to provide that information. I think we would have expected most centres to provide that, and it would not be seen as an add-on cost due to accreditation. We need to be a bit cautious about these costings. Certainly, the advice that I have is that those figures are again inaccurate because they include the wrong information. I will say again, for the record, that I did not say it was 88c per child per week. That is the best prediction that the Pitcher Partners consultancy firm could provide. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing is that the benefit, as I said, is cheerful&mdash;and that is exactly the word. In fact, it is much more than that; there is excitement in some centres as they implement the accreditation process.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Consumers Association report on whether child care is up to scratch reportedly said that one in five parents cannot have choice. What the report does not say is that four out of five parents are getting a choice of child-care centre. Also, it does not explain that many parents in rural Australia are very happy to have child care and that they are not really beating a path to my door to say, `Why can't I choose between long day care and family day care?' What they want is access to child care, and they are pleased to have it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying there is nothing wrong with child care. In an industry that has grown as much as child care has, clearly things are emerging that we want to iron out, that we want to redress and that we want to improve. Many of the comments by Ann Sherry about children's services pertain far more to the services provided by states and their failure to cooperate with the Commonwealth in getting the best mix between child care and preschool services. Yes, there are some things in the child-care area that need to be addressed. I am addressing them; I have been doing so and I will continue to do so. We must have the very best child-care industry and the best services for parents. I strongly believe that quality care for children should be at the centre of our program. </PARA>

<PARA>It frequently happens that I miss the call during taking note of answers to questions, but I have never sought an extension of time. On this occasion I do so because of the importance of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To pick up on the answer given by the Minister for Family Services (Senator Crowley), I point out that in Australia in 1990 there were 30,000 cases of hepatitis C infection known throughout the whole nation; that is, one person in 500. There are currently 1,600 people in Australia with haemophilia with an 85 per cent infection rate with hepatitis C. Where has that infection come from? Clearly that infection has come from inadequately sterilised products with which haemophilia patients are treated. The question of the safety of the products which CSL is putting on the market is very much at issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister's response to my question was that CSL was not mixing foreign blood with plasma from Australia which had come from Red Cross departments in various states. On 12 March 1986 the Red Cross in fact wrote to CSL asking it not to mix its plasma from foreign sources with plasma from Australia. Mr Neville McCarthy from CSL wrote back on 27 March 1986 defending the practice and saying that no other practice would in fact produce the cheap product, and that if CSL sought to keep the products separate the costs of production would be prohibitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to that letter, the Red Cross wrote to Mr McCarthy on 2 May 1986 saying that in view of its legal advice in relation to the safety of its products, it was then refusing to use CSL products for the treatment of patients. Therefore, the minister has given an incorrect answer to the Senate. CSL has been mixing foreign plasma with Australian derived plasma and has in fact been using that both overseas and in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Red Alert</EMPHASIS> to which I referred was prepared by Catherine Beauchamp from the Centre for National Corporate Law Research at the University of Canberra. It goes into considerable detail in relation to this matter and specifically draws attention to the fact that infected material was sent back overseas. She quotes an extensive interview with a senior officer from CSL in relation to hepatitis C in Hong Kong in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What's interesting about that particular issue is that Hong Kong at that particular time didn't test for hepatitis C. . .</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, that is quite contrary to what the minister just said, namely that the standards of testing overseas were equal to WHO standards and equal to standards in Australia. The interview went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . so I doubt that Hong Kong did destroy it,&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, hepatitis C&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">because it's almost endemic in Hong Kong, so since they don't test for hepatitis C in all likelihood the material that they always use in Hong Kong has hepatitis C in it, if you follow the correlation. It's an interesting thing; there are many countries that don't test to the degree they could or <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">should</EMPHASIS>, they use the justification of cost, but in fact in the Hong Kong case I'm inclined to think they didn't destroy it because their approach would be, well, we don't test for hepatitis C anyway, hepatitis C is endemic to our region and therefore they have almost a hundred percent assurance that they have from a thousand donors, that one would have hepatitis C. . .</PARA>
<PARA>That is the source of the infection in the mixed plasma, which is imported into Australia and then mixed with Australian plasma which has caused the infection in the haemophilia patients in this country. I believe this report, which I will seek to table so that other senators can have access to it, contains a lot of very important information which needs a great deal more and much closer investigation. I seek leave to table the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I thank the minister for his very prompt reply to my question. I must say my information was that the voyage had been delayed by up to 12 days, but I hear now that it is eight days behind schedule. I refer back to the concerns that I showed at estimates in June. I think my concerns are shared by quite a few people at the Antarctic Division. At that time the minister said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think you can very comfortably blame me. I am the minister.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope, and I made this point in June in estimates, that we do not have to blame the minister too much. At that time Mr Sayers stated on behalf of the Antarctic Division that this decision to reduce the Antarctic budget by $4.2 million was made in a very short space of time during budget discussions and very little time was given to assess the impact it would have. He said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I guess, at the end of the day, the government made the decision that the one-ship option was best overall for Australia's interests . . .</PARA>
<PARA>That may be the case in the government's opinion, but I can assure honourable senators that that is not the opinion of a lot of the scientists and the people who work in the Antarctic Division. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go back to my genuine concerns, which I share with those people in the Antarctic Division. Although the minister has said that the ship went down a month earlier, that it has not encountered all the heavy ice and extra risks and that there have been no risks to the ship or to people, I remind the minister that things happen in southern waters at the drop of a hat or when least expected, as was borne out by the unfortunate accident of the InCat last weekend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am still concerned about the fact that we have only one ship and no backup support. I have made that point continually and I will continue to do so, because what would have happened if that ship had been beset for a greater period and could not extricate itself from the heavy pack ice? The minister has raised the point about blizzards and whatever, but he has not answered the question as to what measures the government has in place to prevent what could not only be a potential disaster for our Antarctic program but could also perhaps place expeditioners at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister has admitted that the program has been delayed by eight days. The cost of one of those ships is in excess of $100,000 a day, so if it is delayed by eight days my arithmetic shows that that is $800,000. It will not take too many delays to add up to the $4.2 million that the government is trying to save. The point I am trying to make is that I think it has been pound wise and a penny foolish and, at the end of the day, may rue the decision. I do not blame the Antarctic Division in any shape or form. It is doing its best with what it can. As I said, I will point the finger at the minister and will continue to point the finger at the minister. I am pleased to see that he has big shoulders and is willing to take the blame. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every third-rate film or public showing has a sequel or a return. I remember many years ago&mdash;and I am sure my colleagues will remember too&mdash;the very graphic photos of the ALP conference; of the ALP determining policy with its leaders locked outside the door of the room where the decisions were being made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a horror sequel to that third-rate production so many years ago we now have the Hobart ALP national conference where, although some of the elected leaders now sit inside, they are still told what to do by unelected people, and they are told how they should govern Australia and how they should react and vote in parliament. This has become endemic in the way this nation has been governed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We only have to look at the recent debate on uranium in this country to understand how the elected people of the parliament, but particularly those who occupy the government benches at the present time, simply are unable to govern in the best interests of the nation but are required instead to govern in the interests of the ALP factions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you would be well aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, many Labor politicians, those in power&mdash;for example, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Resources and the Minister for Primary Industries, who occupies a seat in this chamber, to name just three&mdash;were determined to overturn the ALP's quite ridiculous three-mine uranium policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three elected politicians clearly understood the stupidity of that three-mine policy. The policy says that uranium from three mines&mdash;two, in fact, as it is&mdash;is okay, it will not cause any problems, but that uranium from other mines is no good. We have good uranium from three mines and every other piece of uranium is bad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These three men&mdash;the Prime Minister, the Minister for Resources, and the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, from this chamber, who represents the Northern Territory&mdash;wanted to change that. Senator Collins has been quite vocal and open about the need to change that policy. The Prime Minister, as well, understands the stupidity of that policy and the damage that that policy is doing to our international credibility and standing, particularly in the business and finance world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those three elected parliamentarians understood the absolute necessity for a change in that stupid, hypocritical policy. They clearly want it to change. Senator Collins, in this chamber, has said on a number of occasions that he wants to change that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was also clear that the Prime Minister of our nation wanted that change. But were they able to do so? Were they able to debate that matter in this chamber, in this parliament or in cabinet and determine that that policy should be changed? Were they, as the elected parliamentarians, able to make decisions in the interests of Australia and Australians? They were not. They were told by a group of 100 or so, I understand&mdash;perhaps half of that&mdash;unelected people, who have absolutely no accountability to the Australian public whatsoever, that they were not allowed to do what they knew was best for the Australian public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Were they told that at the ALP conference out of a concern for the environment? Did the powerbrokers of the ALP tell them they could not do that out of concern for world peace? Did they do it out of a real and genuine interest in disarmament? Did the powerbrokers of the ALP tell the Prime Minister that he could not change the policy out of some real concern for pollution?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Or did the powerbrokers make their decision for none of those reasons but simply as a payback to show a particular mining company in this country that it could not ignore the union movement, that it could not create an enterprise agreement which would give good wages and conditions to its workers and which would help the company and Australia's international competitiveness but without union involvement?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union bosses did not like that. They were determined to ensure that that company was punished for trying to avoid the unions. To make that company understand that it could not buck the unions, the unions and the ALP bosses told the elected Prime Minister that they could not change the three-mine uranium policy which the Prime Minister and most of his ministers understand is an absolute stupidity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an ugly day for Australia when a group of union bosses, because their union was not getting its way with one of Australia's leading companies, hold Australia to ransom&mdash;simply say to Australia, `We don't care what's good for Australia. We don't care that changing that policy would create $1 billion in export income over the next 10 years.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> This policy, if changed, would create many jobs for Australians.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the ALP conference in Hobart we have a sequel to that previous third-rate horror show: we have the return of the faceless men who determine what is best for Australia's future.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This series will really be fun. It will talk about what Sir Robert Menzies has been able to achieve.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the recent ALP conference, we will notice that Bill Ludwig, the national President of the Workers Union, was reported as controlling between 10 and 15 votes out of 102. I would like to see where Bill Ludwig sits in this chamber or in the other place. This is the very point we are on about.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been involved in the Liberal Party organisation for many years and I can see the benefits in managing different points of view. But one thing we have never gone for is having unelected people having a say in how the government of the day&mdash;that would be a Liberal government&mdash;would handle things. Graham Richardson wrote in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> of 11 October 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Labor's platform, mineral exploration is now permitted in national parks, although this occurred more by accident than design. More than half of those who voted for the amendment thought they were restoring the original words of the platform when they were in fact inserting key new words.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for Senator Faulkner's well-run party. There we have a classic case where former Senator Richardson acknowledged that there was a stuff-up. People did not even know what they were voting for. Jennifer Hewett, in reference to the conference, stated in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> dated 30 September 1994:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paul Keating was praising the triumphant pragmatism of the ALP. By yesterday morning a lot of very irritated delegates were calling it much more unpleasant names.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, so much for Senator Faulkner's well-run party. The thrust of this proposal is that the people of Australia are being governed by people who are not in this chamber or the other place. I mentioned the influence of Bill Ludwig. There is also the influence of Bill Kelty, the Secretary of the ACTU, who made his influence felt on uranium mining issues and the rescue of ANL. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just dwell on a couple of matters where policy has been changed by this so-called well-run machine that Senator Faulkner referred to. Firstly, we have the privatisation of airports. Laurie Brereton wanted to sell the federal airports. The unions would not agree and then brokered a deal which saw that the airports would be tendered out for lease&mdash;again an influence from an outside body. I note in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> an article headed `ACTU proposes radical revamp of copyright law'. I suppose that now means that the government's platform will be dictated by the ACTU and the government will revamp its whole standing on copyright law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us get back to the ANL. Bill Kelty, another one of the old mates of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) who was angered by Mr Brereton's pre-emptive attempts to shut out the Maritime Union from ANL discussions, believed that the Maritime Union played an important organisational and financial role in securing Labor's 1993 election victory and therefore could not be overlooked. Brereton, as the Senate would know, comes from a different faction. What we had there was another brokering of a deal. Eventually the minister publicly retreated and threw a fistful of dollars at the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps the greatest example of the Prime Minister of the day being dictated to by the conference was the three mines uranium policy. The Prime Minister would say that he did not really have his heart in it, that he was not really involved in the matter. Nonetheless, he was rolled and we had a situation where the so-called well-run machine fell into disarray because the Right disintegrated in the face of the Left. What we had again was the subservience of the government to unelected people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the factions, which Senator Faulkner mentioned, there are people who have not been elected to this parliament.

I just wonder whether the government of the day will have the guts and fortitude at the polls to tell the people of Australia, `Look, sorry, boys.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was the three-mine policy upheld in Hobart? It was upheld for one simple, ridiculous and bloody-minded reason: because the Queensland division of the AWU was in the midst of a dispute with CRA, the major mining company that would benefit from uranium mining. It was nothing more than a normal industrial dispute, but because the AWU was in the midst of that dispute during the conference it directed its right wing delegates to vote down any change in the government uranium policy. It was done simply to punish CRA. There have been many failures to deliver in government in this country. I have to say that that decision, made by the AWU, is the most bloody-minded decision yet.

The completion of the Aussat sale in December 1991 marked an important step in the development of Australia's telecommunications system.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conducting its review, the committee took a forward looking approach and focused on aspects of the sale which affect the Commonwealth's future interests. Two areas were of particular interest to the committee. The first was to ensure that appropriate mechanisms were in place to monitor the future performance obligations entered into by Optus. The second was to draw lessons from the Aussat sale experience which may help improve future sales processes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As part of the sale agreement, Optus undertook to achieve certain goals in the period up to the end of the telecommunications duopoly. The main undertakings were: to extend its fixed and mobile telecommunications network throughout Australia, achieving certain `network roll-out' milestones at various dates up to June 1997; and to achieve certain levels of investment, Australian content, and expenditure on training and research and development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the committee's concerns was that, at the time of sale, the Department of Communications did not have in place any arrangements with which to monitor Optus's network roll-out performance. By way of contrast, the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, as it was at the time, had an extensive system in place to monitor Optus's industry development undertakings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee acknowledges that the Department of Communications now has in place an acceptable monitoring system. However, the committee believes it to be important that such arrangements be negotiated as an integral part of a contract for the sale of an asset. It is inappropriate and unnecessarily risky for the Commonwealth to seek to negotiate such arrangements after a sale has been concluded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second lesson to be drawn for future sales is that any provision for `excusable events' should be clearly defined so that the rights and obligations of all parties are clearly understood. The committee explored the Audit Office's concern that the excusable events clause in the Aussat sale deed could threaten the timing of Optus's network roll-out. This stemmed from the vague, broad nature of the clause and the limited and inflexible range of responses available to the Commonwealth in the event of any network roll-out delays. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the public hearing into the sale, the committee was pleased to receive advice from Optus that there had been no excusable events to date and that Optus had agreed to give the department forewarning of any intention to invoke the excusable events provisions. The committee sympathises with Audit's concern in relation to the breadth of the excusable events provision in the Aussat sale contract, but accepts that the provision was the best available in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth's relatively poor bargaining position also contributed to the absence of any liquidated damages provisions with the contract. The committee was advised by the department that inclusion of such provisions was considered by Optus to be a `deal breaker'. The committee was informed, however, that, despite the absence of such contract enforcement provisions, there were various commercial incentives for Optus to fulfil its obligations. These were: the opportunity for fines under the licence agreement if Optus failed to meet its network roll-out milestones&mdash;the licence conditions are monitored by Austel; secondly, Optus's acknowledgment in the roll-out deed that failure to meet its obligations will yield the Commonwealth pecuniary and non-pecuniary damages; and, thirdly, most severe of all the loss of favourable introductory interconnect rates with Telecom if the Optus system is connected to Telecom's after certain specified dates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee was advised during the public hearing that Optus was in fact substantially ahead of its roll-out schedule. Nevertheless, the committee notes that towards the end of network roll-out&mdash;as less profitable areas are reached and as the end of the duopoly approaches&mdash;the commercial imperatives for Optus could weaken. This is not to say that Optus would forsake its obligations&mdash;as I have said already Optus has more than met its obligations to date. Rather it is to say that the `reserve powers' of regulatory penalties could become more important to the Commonwealth than they are at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee therefore considers that in future sales the Commonwealth should seek to enforce performance covenants through a combination of commercial and regulatory penalties or incentives. In conclusion, the committee believes that although there are aspects of the Aussat sale agreement which are less than ideal from the Commonwealth's perspective, the Commonwealth achieved the best possible outcome in the circumstances. Those involved in the second telecommunications carrier selection team should be congratulated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The audit report and the Committee's review have highlighted issues which the committee hopes will assist in any future sales of Commonwealth assets. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill provides for the classification of films, publications and computer games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The agreement of the States and Territories to the Bill proceeding provides a unique opportunity, on a co-operative national basis, to make Australia's censorship laws more uniform and simple, with consequential benefits to the industry and the public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is the Commonwealth's contribution to revising the current legislative structure in cooperation with the States and Territories. The Bill, when enacted, will not be able to be brought into force until complementary State and Territory enforcement legislation is enacted. The model State and Territory legislation is currently being drafted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australia's censorship laws are in an unsatisfactory state. They comprise Regulations under the Customs Act 1901, which, among other matters, establish the Censorship Board and the Film and Literature Board of Review, a Commonwealth administered Australian Capital Territory Ordinance and State and Territory legislation. The Censorship Board has, for many years, performed the classification function for films under State and Territory legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are considerable difficulties in administering the current laws as they are unnecessarily complicated and not uniform.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this background in mind, the Australian Law Reform Commission was asked to report on how the laws could be simplified and made more uniform and efficient while preserving the co-operative nature of the current scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission presented its Report on Censorship Procedure in 1991 and the Bill has been prepared, in consultation with the States and Territories, following the recommendations in that Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Reflecting the co-operative nature of Australia's censorship laws, the Bill is for a Federal Act for the Australian Capital Territory under section 122 of the Constitution. The Australian Capital Territory self-government legislation reserved to the Commonwealth the power to classify material for censorship purposes. This was to ensure that a national censorship scheme was preserved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will establish the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board and set out the procedures for classification. Classification decisions will be made in accordance with the National Classification Code and Guidelines to help apply the Code. Both the Code and the Guidelines must be agreed between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new scheme it is proposed that State and Territory legislation will adopt, in enforcement laws, the classification decisions made under the Commonwealth Act. It is the State and Territory legislation that will, in effect, govern the submission of films, publications and computer games to the Classification Board for classification. It will also deal with the consequences, in the respective jurisdictions, of the different classifications given by the Board to films, publications and computer games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recommending the structure reflected in the Bill, the Commission observed that it accurately reflects, and maintains, the balance of responsibilities that has currently been arrived at between Australian jurisdictions. It also recognises that, in relation to the classification criteria and categories, the Commonwealth, States and Territories are equal partners and that policy on these matters is derived from agreement between all jurisdictions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission noted that the benefit of the new scheme was that `[t]here will be a single procedure, avoiding the overlaps and duplications that presently exist, and the classifiers will derive their powers from a single source, removing the difficulty that they sometimes face now of conflicting legislation from different jurisdictions.'</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new legislative scheme is an excellent example of co-operative Federalism. For example:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will only apply by its own force in respect of the Australian Capital Territory and the extent to which classification decisions under it have effect in other jurisdictions is a matter entirely for the State or Territory concerned;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commonwealth and the States and Territories have equal voting rights in settling the criteria and guidelines under which classification decisions are made;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories are given the right to be consulted about appointments to the two Boards; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">The States and Territories will receive a guaranteed share of the revenue from fees collected to assist with enforcement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In case all States do not agree to adopt the classifications under the Commonwealth Act in relation to films, publications and computer games, the Bill, in order to preserve a national scheme, makes provision for the States and the Northern Territory to confer functions on the Classification Board under their own legislation in accordance with an agreement between the Commonwealth and the jurisdiction concerned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill is essentially procedural in nature and reflects the current approach to censorship matters agreed by the Commonwealth, States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill material will continue to be classified on the basis of the principles that adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want, that children should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them, and that everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material they find offensive. The Bill also introduces a new principle, namely, the need to take account of community concerns about depictions which condone or incite violence, particularly sexual violence, and the portrayal of persons in a demeaning manner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite the unsatisfactory state of our current laws, Australia is at the forefront of other comparable countries in its approach to censorship matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The basic approach adopted is to give adults sufficient information, through the classifications given to material and the consumer advice provided, to make an informed choice about what they want to see, hear or read and what material they allow their children to have access to.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I was interested to note from a recent Australian Bureau of Statistics survey, commissioned by the Office of Film and Literature Classification, that significant use is made of the classification system by adults in selecting suitable viewing for their children and also for themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In relation to the content of the material to be found in the various classifications, I and my State and Territory counterparts are well aware of the genuine concern in some sections of the community about the amount of violence in films and the possible harmful effects this might have on children and some adults.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Governments have already taken positive action to address community concerns. The measures include the tightening up by Censorship Ministers of the guidelines for the `M' and `R' classifications, the introduction of the new `MA' classification and a stricter regime for the classification of computer games.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The question whether classification decisions reflect community attitudes (and thereby enjoy general community acceptance) is ultimately dependent on the individual and collective decisions of the people who comprise the two classification Boards. There is a need, recognised by all Censorship Ministers, to ensure that the Board members who make the classification decisions on behalf of the community are, as far as practicable, broadly representative of that community. I have been paying close attention to the composition of the current Boards in consultation with my State and Territory colleagues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure Board members remain aware of community attitudes the Censorship Board has, as recommended by the Law Reform Commission, a continuing community consultation program which includes arranging for ordinary members of the public to come in and review films and indicate the classification and consumer advice they would award to them. This is supplemented by research projects on community standards, the results of which are made available to Board members.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As to the provisions of the Bill itself, I have already mentioned that it establishes the Classification Board and the Classification Review Board. It also contains procedural provisions relating to applications, decision making, notification of decisions and review of decisions. As the Government intends to establish the Office of Film and Literature Classification, which services the two Boards, as a separate business unit, there are also standard financial and accounting provisions in the Bill to achieve this end.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new scheme all films and videos, except those for business, accounting, professional, scientific or educational purposes, must be classified. In relation to publications, the Law Reform Commission recommended that the current voluntary scheme be replaced by a partially compulsory scheme and this is reflected in the Bill. Under this scheme publications will be classified by the new Classification Board, and not departmental officers as at present. A partially compulsory scheme is achieved by, in effect, requiring publications that straddle the Category 1 restricted classification, which is the lowest classification for restricted publications, and the upper end of the Unrestricted category to be submitted for classification. Failure to do so will be an offence under State and Territory legislation. This should result in many more publications being submitted for classification.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Bill will enable the Director to call in publications that fall within this class, which are called submittable publications in the Bill, for classification. Failure to abide by the Director's request will be an offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes provisions to enable the classification of computer games. An interim scheme to enable computer games to be classified was introduced earlier this year through amendments to the ACT Classification of Publications Ordinance 1983 which is administered by the Commonwealth. Following the decision of the States and Territories to not allow `X' or `R' classified computer games to be available the Bill makes no provision for these classifications. It also clarifies the definition of `computer game' in response to anomalies arising from the interim scheme that have been brought to the attention of the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under current arrangements, fees are levied under State and Territory legislation, collected by the Commonwealth and shared equally between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to levy classification fees in the future. In return for the States and Territories foregoing their fee powers, and in recognition of their enforcement costs, it is proposed that they each receive the average of their share over the last five years, a total of $600,000 in 1994-95. This amount will be adjusted in future years by the changes in the Consumer Price Index.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will also enable the Commonwealth to increase, over several years, charges for classification services so that there is substantial cost recovery. This will be done by introducing charges for new initiatives and increasing existing charges to reflect the cost of the service provided, thereby providing savings to the Commonwealth. These changes will not only fund the Government's initiatives to address the community need for readily accessible classification advice but also enable the provision of a more efficient and timely service to clients.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I believe this Bill represents a significant advance in an area which has a daily impact on the Australian Community. It is a welcome co-operative initiative between all Australian Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Regulations, as contained in Statutory Rules 1994 No. 259 and made under the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987, be disallowed.</PARA>
<PARA>The effective aim of the regulations is to allow for ANSTO to condition a quantity of radioactive wastes, which is the responsibility of the Commonwealth, Australian Defence Industries Ltd, and the Australian Radiation Laboratory, and then transport that conditioned waste to Woomera for storage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rationale for disallowance of these regulations is simple: a risk is associated with the transport and processing of this waste, as with any nuclear waste, and these risks have not been sufficiently considered in the context of normal environmental and planning laws, nor in the wider community through proper consultation. The issue of ANSTO's immunity from proper scrutiny under normal state and territory legislation is also crucial in this context, and I will return to this issue shortly. The environmental, public health and occupational health risks associated with nuclear processes, technology and waste are well known but, unfortunately, are rarely acknowledged by authorities, many of which are part of the nuclear industry&mdash;a case of self-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia recently, Dr Stephen Proud, a member of the Medical Association for the Prevention of War, spoke at a media conference about the health effects of uranium and associated nuclear materials. He cited evidence that uranium, for example, affects the genetic make-up of the male sperm and increases the incidence of childhood leukaemia. Radioactive contamination also damages the DNA, which irreversibly creates a legacy for all future generations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following extracts from a recent media release by the Medical Association for the Prevention of War provide graphic evidence of the very real concerns about uranium and the nuclear industry. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Radioactive waste from nuclear reactors contains several hundred elements, many of which remain radioactive for hundreds, and some for thousands, of years. Plutonium is so toxic that hypothetically half a kilogram if adequately distributed, could initiate lung cancer in 5.6 billion human beings. Its half life is 24,400 years and it only requires 5 kilos to manufacture a nuclear weapon. Each thousand megawatt reactor manufactures 200 kilos of plutonium per year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Strontium 90, a calcium analogue with a radioactive life of 600 years causes bone cancer or leukaemia. Caesium 137, a potassium analogue, also dangerous for 600 years causes muscle sarcomas. Many isotopes, including radioactive iodine which causes thyroid cancer, strontium 90, caesium 137, plutonium and many others are concentrated at each step of the food chain. Furthermore they are tasteless, odourless and invisible, so contaminated food is not detectable by human senses.</PARA>
<PARA>The irony of this sad tale is that the nuclear industry often attempts to justify its existence by referring to the use of medical isotopes to treat the very cancers caused by these radioactive elements. Perhaps we should be looking at preventive medicine, as MAPWA states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We spend hundreds of millions of dollars attempting to cure cancer and/or prevent it. On the other hand, mining companies wish to make money by exporting the element which can increase the incidence of these diseases. Doctors know that the most important principle of preventive medicine is that if a disease is incurable the only recourse is prevention.</PARA>
<PARA>There has also been a great deal of work done in Australia and in other parts of the world on the possibility of using cyclotrons for the relatively small amount of nuclear material that is used in diagnostic medicine in Australia. Therefore, the actual amount of nuclear waste that we create in Australia could be very much reduced without the need for nuclear reactors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These environmental health problems are not theoretical. There are many examples around the world of long term or sudden exposure to uranium tailings, radioactive waste or radioactive fallout having caused substantial community health problems. While the thousands of deaths and genetic mutations in Chernobyl are probably the most recent high profile example, there are many others around the world. In the western United States there has been an unusually high incidence of birth defects among babies born to Navaho Indians, due to the proximity of the Navaho nation to more than 350 abandoned open-cut uranium mines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the history of accidents and problems at the ANSTO facility at Lucas Heights, it seems ludicrous to consider adding to the risk by transporting nuclear waste from St Marys, or any other site in Australia, to Lucas Heights for storage for an indeterminate period while it is processed and then transported to Woomera or other waste storage sites. The problems at Lucas Heights are well documented. In July 1990, for example, there was an extensive article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Bulletin</EMPHASIS> entitled `How safe is the old lady of Lucas Heights?' In this article, senior engineers expressed concern about the safety of the HIFAR facility. Other reports in 1990 highlighted serious concerns about health problems linked to uranium dust. In 1993, the Sutherland Shire Council, which is responsible for the region around the Lucas Heights facility, claimed that the people living in the vicinity of the nuclear facility are at a significantly higher risk than had previously been admitted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of radioactive waste management in Australia is also a woeful tale of incompetence. For years, radioactive waste has been created with no thought to its eventual disposal and, indeed, in the full knowledge that no disposal method exists. That the Commonwealth government now wants to reward some of the organisations which have caused this problem with immunity from state and territory laws is hard to credit. Organisations such as ADI have been shown to be reckless in their creation of radioactive waste in the past. To make them less accountable for that radioactive waste is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal by the government fits well with the sorry state of radioactive waste management in this country. Currently ANSTO is trying to deal with its stockpile of 1,600 spent nuclear fuel rods. Its solution up to this point has been to send them on a hazardous sea voyage across the Pacific Ocean and dump them in the United States. This is a reckless option and one which the 1993 <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research Reactor Review</EMPHASIS> described as `morally dubious'. It may also be impossible. The spent fuel would, under the ANSTO proposal, go to the Savannah River site in South Carolina, yet recently a US court placed a permanent injunction against such shipments. While the US government will appeal this decision, it may be too late for ANSTO, which needs to make a shipment of spent fuel by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is also trying to find a site for a national low and intermediate level waste dump. Again, it is a flawed proposal, which basically would involve dumping radioactive waste out of sight and then, hopefully, out of mind. The national dump would be a shallow trench in an arid area&mdash;a method which is environmentally unacceptable. It is also politically problematic. The government hopes that by dumping the waste in a remote area people will simply forget it exists, leaving ANSTO free to continue creating radioactive waste. It is not a solution to the problem; it is simply an attempt to deny that the problem exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The granting of immunity from state and territory laws to these radioactive waste creating organisations is just another example of the way in which governments seek to shield the nuclear industry and its related organisations from proper public scrutiny and accountability. No other industry has enjoyed such protection and favour, not only in Australia but also internationally. I would remind senators that it was only in 1987 that the Atomic Energy Act 1953 and its draconian security provisions were repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current federal government, whilst repealing that act, has still allowed ANSTO unacceptable freedom from even the most basic accountability. Currently, ANSTO is subject only to Commonwealth legislation as a result of the 1992 ANSTO Amendment Act. This is of great concern, given that existing legislation relating to ANSTO is so deficient. There is no legislation, for example, that covers discharges from ANSTO's HIFAR reactor. This reactor is located in a residential area in Sydney's south and releases large amounts of certain radioactive isotopes. Its discharges of radioactive iodine 131, for example, are 20 times higher than the massive Sellafield reprocessing facility in the United Kingdom. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill asked who I think should regulate it. I will mention this as I go further. The evidence of proper consultation with the community, environmental groups and local governments has, not surprisingly, been poor. Specifically in relation to the proposal that is the subject of the regulations we are discussing here today, I am aware that the Sutherland shire was advised, not consulted, on the same day that these regulations were tabled in this parliament. Government advisers have assured me that there will be consultation with environmental groups, but there seems to be little evidence of this. Even if that consultation takes place, it will be too late. Consultation should take place before legislation and regulations are drafted, not after they are tabled in this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been concerns expressed about the independence of the Nuclear Safety Bureau, which is given the responsibility of monitoring the activities of ANSTO. These concerns have been partly addressed by merging the Nuclear Safety Bureau with the Australian Radiation Laboratories to form the Australian Institute of Radiation Protection, which is under the control of the minister for health, Dr Lawrence. Unfortunately, there is still a conflict of interest here as the health department has an involvement in nuclear medicine. In addition, the AIRP is still largely staffed by ANSTO personnel or ex-ANSTO personnel. I would like to know why the government does not establish a truly independent monitoring body, with independent nuclear scientists, under the control of the environment minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The federal government's response to the appalling problems associated with ANSTO and the inability to properly handle nuclear waste has been to extend the immunity referred to earlier, which ANSTO enjoys, to other organisations, spreading the cloak of secrecy and protection. Such immunity should not be granted to any organisation. It runs completely counter to the principles of open, democratic government and the right of citizens to hold government instrumentalities accountable for their actions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thus, organisations such as ADI have got themselves into a situation where they have created radioactive waste with which they are unable to deal. To get them off the hook&mdash;that is what the government is trying to do&mdash;the federal government is prepared to rely on such anti-democratic legislation as the 1992 ANSTO Amendment Act. The question must be asked: why does this government go to such lengths to protect the nuclear industry and its cohorts? If we look purely at the economics of this industry, which is all the government ever does, we see that the Australian taxpayer has invested the 1991 dollar equivalent of $2.5 billion in the nuclear industry since the 1960s and received the extraordinary return on that investment of approximately $110 million. What a wonderful investment! One can only ask why the government will not implement the only real solution to Australia's current radioactive waste crisis: stopping it being created in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the proposal that is the subject of these regulations, I would propose that there be a comprehensive environmental impact assessment process that incorporates proper rather than tokenistic public consultation. I am aware that the government has expressed concern that the disallowance of this motion will result in the waste being left at St Marys but I feel that if proper consultation had taken place on this issue before the regulations were finalised some positive options could have been examined. There are people working in the environment movement and in academic circles who have extensive knowledge of the nuclear industry and the options for nuclear waste storage. We do not have to rely entirely on ANSTO for advice in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that this proposal for an environmental impact statement and public consultation on storage options is acceptable to the Sutherland Shire Council and to environmental groups such as Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace which have been actively involved in this issue and which have considerable expertise in these issues. I am sure that the government of the state of New South Wales would also welcome the opportunity to have proper input to a process such as this, given the concerns that it has expressed in the past. I trust that the Senate will give this disallowance motion serious consideration. It is not a move that the Greens have taken lightly. We are concerned about the whole issue of nuclear waste disposal and feel that this regulation is a good example of the problems that we will continue to have to face unless the issue is seriously addressed in this parliament and in the broader community. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, the Australian Democrats have pleasure in supporting Senator Margetts's motion to disallow the ANSTO regulations, and for very much the same reasons as those outlined by Senator Margetts. We have been concerned for very many years about the risks posed by radioactivity to workers and to the general community, and we have taken a position of opposition to both the military and civil use of nuclear power.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also take the position that any country responsible for the manufacture of chemical or radioactive waste is also responsible for its safe handling, storage and disposal. This waste having been generated here, it poses a problem for Australia and we should not seek to shift that problem to another country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that, and despite the fact that the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor has been there for a long time, we have not yet come up with a permanent repository for radioactive waste. The processing which is anticipated to take place at the Lucas Heights site is really only a temporary measure while we consider what to do with this material in a permanent way. We are concerned that here we have a potentially dangerous material, about which we should have decided what to do long before this. But we have procrastinated and have not yet come up with a permanent solution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are also concerned about the matter alluded to by Senator Margetts, that the law, as amended in relation to ANSTO, absolves ANSTO from the state environmental protection laws. For that reason, if for no other, we would expect the opposition to also support this disallowance motion. If anything, the opposition has been very vigorous in its defence of states rights. Although it did not support us at the time of the passage of this legislation, I hope it will see the error of its ways and support this disallowance motion on the grounds that ANSTO is simply riding roughshod over state protection laws. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular amendment, which was passed in 1992, provides that, subject to subsection 4, the law to which it applies does not apply and can never be taken to have applied in relation to ANSTO, its property, its transactions or anything done by or on behalf of that organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Margetts pointed out, in its place we have a totally inadequate and rather internal type of supervision and regulation which is effectively no regulation at all. It is certainly not the independent regulation to which most OECD countries would adhere and which any reasonable person would regard as sensible, given the dangerous nature of many of the radioactive materials involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amounts of radioactivity involved here are really relatively small. I understand that the amounts are about seven and a half grams of radium 226, one and a half grams of americium 241, only a very small amount of strontium-cobalt, some transuranics and some carbon 14. The question is not the amount of radioactivity but the principle involved. While there is a code of practice in place for safe transportation of radioactive substances, the treatment of these materials, which is supposed to occur when they get to Lucas Heights, is not covered by a set of procedures which have been subject to close scrutiny. The proponents have outlined how they propose to deal with these things but that is not the same as having a regulation in place which lays down the rules by which that handling and treatment will be conducted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government of New South Wales&mdash;a Liberal government&mdash;had objected most vigorously at the time of the passage of the amendments, which effectively removed the rights of planning legislation and environmental protection legislation in New South Wales to carry out a supervisory role with respect to ANSTO. Again, for that reason alone, the opposition should join with us on this disallowance motion. Moreover, as Senator Margetts has already pointed out, the Sutherland Shire Council has very vigorously opposed the shifting of these radioactive wastes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, if local citizens are to have any influence at all in this chamber, then the vigorous objections of citizens both to the continuation of the operation of the reactor&mdash;it is 30 years old and it has been some 40 years since its planning&mdash;and to the movement of this radioactive material, which in the absence of a permanent repository might remain at the Lucas Heights site, should be taken seriously and we should disallow this particular regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The operation of the New South Wales law had imposed certain conditions prior to 1992. Judgments had been given in favour of the Sutherland Shire Council prior to that time, and those legal judgments are, of course, still in place. But the passage of the amendments effectively took away any rights which the people of New South Wales could use, through either their state or local governments, with respect to their perceived exposure to danger. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for those reasons that we strongly support this disallowance motion. In doing so, we enjoin the government most strongly to move forward and complete the process of determining a permanent repository site and exactly the conditions under which that repository will be run, and to set up a properly independent authority so that the public can be satisfied that those conditions are adhered to with proper sanctions, are transparent with public input and are removed as far as possible from a close association with ANSTO. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly on the question of a permanent repository, again Senator Margetts has drawn attention to the Woomera site in South Australia. We have seen just in the last couple of years Lake Torrens, to the north of Spencer Gulf, filled with water for the first time since white settlement. We have seen for several years a very significant weather shift in South Australia in which the rains have come extremely late in the year and have extended through Christmas time. That has been related to weather coming from the Kimberleys across central Australia and depositing rain in the early summer in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that Woomera is, and has been since we have known Woomera, an arid site of very little use in a conventional exploitative sense of land use. However, given the sorts of weather changes which those who are looking at the greenhouse effect are talking about, again I ask the government to consider when it is thinking about a site the fact that in a very short order in terms of human history, and given the length of time these radioactive materials remain active&mdash;I have drawn attention to the fact that one of the radioactive products involved in this shift is radium with a half life of 1,600 years&mdash;and the significance of greenhouse weather shifts, it may well be that Woomera will become the breadbasket of Australia within the next few hundred years with a very significant change in agricultural practices. We should not be precluding alternative uses of land which we now regard as arid and fairly useless and be closing off options for future generations by making them the site of radioactive dumps. We should be taking into account the need for future generations to have those options left available to them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the concerns that I have in looking at a possible site for putting radioactive wastes is that there is an assumption implicit in the criteria which are laid down that what we observe now and what we have observed over the last 200 years will be the situation for the next 200 years and another 200 years after that. That assumption is patently false and we should not be closing off options for future generations by denying the ability to use sites for alternative purposes should there be a significant change in weather patterns. I simply put that to the government to take into account in considering a permanent repository. The shifting of material from St Marys to Lucas Heights is really a much narrower consideration and we have considerable pleasure in supporting Senator Margetts's motion to disallow this regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion that certain regulations under the ANSTO Act should be disallowed. It is an important matter because it concerns the passage and storage of low level nuclear waste&mdash;waste that, we understand, is currently being stored at the ADI premises at St Marys in the western suburbs of Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 5 of the ANSTO Act sets out the functions of ANSTO. Those functions include conditioning, managing and storing radioactive materials and radioactive waste arising from a number of different sources but including the activities of other persons who are specified in the regulations. I understand that what the government wants to do is provide ANSTO expertise to put this material that is currently held at St Marys&mdash;material which, I think, is technically owned by ADI, although there may be some question about that&mdash;into a safe form for transport and then to transport it to what the government is providing as temporary storage at Woomera in South Australia. In order to do that, the government has made this regulation under the provision that I have just mentioned in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the purposes of paragraph 5(1)(ba) of the Act&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>which is the provision that I have just paraphrased&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the following persons are specified under subparagraph 5(1)(ba)(iv) of the Act:</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(c) Australian Radiation Laboratory (formerly known as Commonwealth Radium Laboratory, Commonwealth X-Ray and Radium Laboratory, Commonwealth Radiation Laboratory).</PARA>
<PARA>So what the government has sought to give ANSTO under this regulation is the very wide power to deal further with nuclear waste in Australia, waste that has been created by the Commonwealth, by ADI or by the Australian Radiation Laboratory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have listened to the contributions of the Greens and the Australian Democrats and it seems to me that the position of the coalition is a little different from theirs. Basically it seemed to me that Senator Margetts for the Greens was really attacking&mdash;I hope I am interpreting this correctly&mdash;the nuclear science facility at Lucas Heights and questioning whether the regulatory authority is sufficiently independent and sufficiently adequate to safeguard the public interest. Senator Coulter for the Democrats seemed to be arguing that the material currently at St Marys should not be transported to Woomera and put to us that Woomera some 100 years hence may well have a more valuable function than storage of nuclear waste. That might be so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the nuclear science facility. We believe that it brings benefits to Australia and the Australian people. Although Senator Margetts said that preventive medicine might be more useful to the community, we nevertheless believe that nuclear medicine has served the best interests of the community and continues to do so; that this site helps produce the material that is necessary; and the science that is carried on there is beneficial to Australian interests in many different ways. But this really is not a debate about the nuclear science facility that Australia has, nor is it a debate about the effectiveness of the regulatory authority. This is a debate about ANSTO being empowered to deal further with waste that has been produced by various nuclear facilities in this country or waste that has been brought into this country and utilised in the defence industry or in other areas of science. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to us that the nuclear waste that is currently stored at St Marys in the western suburbs of Sydney should be moved. It does not seem to us to be a suitable repository for that type of material. We are particularly disappointed that the government does not seem to have moved any further, despite its promises to provide in this country a permanent repository for this waste or the low level waste which is produced from the Lucas Heights facility and which has been stored there. We think that that is an equally inappropriate place in the southern suburbs of Sydney for the storage of low-level nuclear waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have therefore been forced to accept the reality that, as a balance of choice, it would be better if this material was temporarily stored at Woomera rather than in the suburbs of Sydney. We were unhappy that the government failed to enter into any form of reasonable consultative process with the people of South Australia in that decision, but nevertheless, as I said, we recognise that it would be better on a temporary basis that the waste be stored there than in the suburbs of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been a little shy of giving any greater level of support for that because in many ways we think it is enabling the government to further avoid its responsibility to provide a permanent repository. We would be somewhat concerned that this short-term storage may well turn out to be medium-term storage, if not long-term storage, and we would like to find ways in which we could further lever the government to meet the commitment that it has made earlier. But we do not think that this is the occasion to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, if in fact the regulation that the government had made had been limited to enable ANSTO personnel to make safe this material for transport and to enable them to transport it to this temporary facility at Woomera, then we would be prepared to support the regulation. We have said that to the government and I last said it to Senator Schacht, who seemed to have the conduct of the matter, a matter of only some hours ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have been telling the government for some time that its regulation, in our view, goes far beyond what it claims to be the purpose of that regulation. As I have said, it includes waste produced by the Commonwealth, by ADI, which the government says is the purpose, also by the Australian Radiation Laboratory. It in no way limits what ANSTO personnel might do with its material. There is concern in New South Wales that as a matter of convenience the material will be simply transferred to Lucas Heights. The government has said that it might be that some of the material will need to be transferred to Lucas Heights to be made safe for transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have trouble with the logic of that. If it is unsafe to be transported out of Sydney, I cannot quite see how it is safe to be transported across Sydney. Nevertheless, the government has not gone further in its submissions to us, other than to say that it might be necessary to use facilities at Lucas Heights to help make safe facilities that in turn cannot be transported to the St Marys site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we could see that the government had demonstrated good faith in this area and had kept its promises over the years, we might be more prepared to accept what the government says is its intentions in this matter. But it does not have a good record in this regard. It is simply asking us to give it much greater discretion in dealing with this waste than is necessary to achieve the objective that it claims, and we are not prepared to agree to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate that if the government is prepared to put its regulation in a form that is sufficient to allow it to make safe this material and to transport it to Woomera, then we will agree to it. As I said to Senator Schacht earlier today, if as a result this regulation is disallowed and there needs to be an appropriate resolution under the Acts Interpretation Act to rescind the resolution that is passed to enable a new regulation to be put down in more limited terms, then we will facilitate that as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government, when its scientists and technicians have access to the material at ADI, finds that in fact it does need to be transported to Lucas Heights, and the government puts a substantive case to that effect to the parliament, then we will look sympathetically upon that as well. As I have said, we want to get the material out of St Marys. I do not know why the government has not been prepared to meet the reasonable requirements that we have asked for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government should be aware that what it is proposing is causing concern in the suburbs of Sydney. There is concern around Lucas Heights, there has been concern around St Marys, and I do not know why the government was not prepared to come in here today with a form of regulation that would achieve what it wanted without raising the extra concerns that I have mentioned. Perhaps the minister will explain the position when he responds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As things stand at the moment, on the basis of the material that I have read and the arguments that I have listened to, I will on behalf of the coalition support the motion to rescind this regulation. But, as I have said, and I stress, simply not in a way that is intended to make difficult the responsibility of the government to move this material but in a way that would responsibly meet our wider responsibility to the community at large and facilitate the removal of this waste to Woomera. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Other speakers, in their introductory comments, have described the circumstances that lead us to this situation. Let me, as briefly as possible, seek to address why these regulations have been brought in, their purpose and intention, and those steps which the Commonwealth is prepared to take to seek to ensure that they are acceptable to the majority of the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ANSTO Act, under which these regulations have been made, provides that the functions of ANSTO include conditioning, managing and storing radioactive materials and radioactive waste, arising either from activities in which ANSTO is involved or from the activities of persons who are specified in regulations. That is the form of the act and the requirement that these regulations need to meet. The intent of this regulation, which came into effect in July, is to permit ANSTO to undertake the work of conditioning a small quantity of radioactive wastes presently stored at the site of the former St Marys munitions factory in western Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some detailed description of it has been given by other senators; I will not repeat all that, but let me go to it in this abbreviated way. The waste, which is approximately 10 cubic metres in volume, arises from various past activities of the Commonwealth and is managed by Australian Defence Industries on behalf of the Department of Defence. The wastes need to be moved to allow ADI to clear and redevelop the site as it proposes to consolidate its operations elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">About half the waste is classified as category A or B; that is, a low level of radioactivity and includes items such as electronic valves, luminous watches and luminous compasses. The remainder is classified as category S, or intermediate level waste, and it is this which requires conditioning. The conditioning will immobilise the wastes to make them safer for transportation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, ANSTO is the Commonwealth specialist nuclear technology arm and is the appropriate Australian body to undertake the conditioning. ANSTO advises that its current intention is to do all the conditioning at St Marys and that it is highly unlikely that it will be necessary to bring any items of the waste to the ANSTO site at Lucas Heights. It is not possible, while the material is still sealed, to be absolutely certain about that; we need to open it up, under these regulations, before we can be absolutely certain&mdash;but that is the intention and the expectation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems inconceivable that anyone could be opposed to the basic intent of the regulation&mdash;I understand that Senator Hill said that he is not&mdash;which allows ANSTO to make radioactive wastes safer so that they can be moved from an area which is to be redeveloped as a housing site. It is inconceivable that the purpose can be under challenge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at what I understand to be&mdash;and from the debate appears to be confirmed&mdash;the main concerns with the regulation: firstly, it might give ANSTO and the Commonwealth wider powers than simply to condition the St Marys waste, that is, it could apply to all Commonwealth wastes indefinitely; secondly, the concern by the local Sutherland council that some material may have to be brought to Lucas Heights; and, thirdly, an allegation that there has been a lack of consultation in the treatment of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal with each of these in turn. One is the breadth of the powers. I think I picked up Senator Hill's point correctly, which is additional to that which I previously understood; a concern about the inclusion of the Australian Radiation Laboratory under this heading. I understand that it is responsible for a small amount of this waste and that therefore it needs to be included. That is my advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government and I accept that, in its current form, the regulation could be applied to other Commonwealth waste. That was not its intention on introduction and it is not our intention now, but as it currently stands it could so be interpreted and therefore used in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a consequence of that, we have indicated to interested senators&mdash;I understand to Green senators and coalition representatives&mdash;that we are prepared to introduce an amended regulation with a sunset clause of 31 December 1995. This would allow sufficient time to ensure that the work on the St Marys wastes could be completed while providing a genuine curb on the regulation being used for any other purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been suggested that we could do this by a regulation specifying this particular waste. But the clear advice to the government from the Attorney-General's Department is that such a specification would have no legal meaning. The act requires the regulation to specify only the persons on whose behalf the ANSTO is conditioning the waste. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Attorney-General's Department continues to advise that the present form of the regulations is correct given the requirements of the act. Separate regulations would be needed if ANSTO were to undertake conditioning work on behalf of other legal entities, such as Commonwealth statutory authorities or state government bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence, the only other Commonwealth waste to which these regulations could possibly be applied in the future is some waste administered by the Department of Defence, of which there is about 50 cubic metres, I am told. It may be that some of this waste will need conditioning for transfer to the permanent low level repository when that is established. But that is unlikely to be necessary before the end of 1995. If it is ultimately necessary to move that waste, a new regulation would be brought forward after 1995. The sunset clause would come to an end and any new material needed to be dealt with would be dealt with under some such legislation; that is, within the constraints of the legislation, an effective guarantee that this regulation will not be used beyond the purposes for which it is intended, although we accept that the drafting, as it currently stands, could be better and we will move to clarify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we do not have the capacity to amend the regulation. We all know the procedural constraints on the Senate on amending a regulation in the way proposed, but we give a guarantee that we will, as soon as possible, come back with such a regulation. I understand that 7 November will be the first practicable day on which we can introduce such a regulation and we undertake to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second concern is the possibility that the material might come to Lucas Heights. I understand that this concern was raised by the Sutherland council in whose area the Lucas Heights facility is sited. I have already pointed out that the advice from ANSTO is that it intends to do all the conditioning at St Marys and that it is highly unlikely that it will be necessary to bring any items of the waste to the ANSTO site at Lucas Heights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it is remotely possible that when ANSTO starts treating the waste some items may require specialised facilities not available at St Marys.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot see how the circumstance is going to be enhanced, in terms of dealing with the problem senators have, by repealing this regulation. I cannot see that what they are envisaging is not somehow going to be achieved by the point they are making. It is very understandable&mdash;this is an issue about which people have concerns. That is a very human thing. There are people opposed to everything related to the nuclear industry and some who are not, but who are reasonably concerned to ensure that the provisions of any particular proposal are seriously and closely considered. All that is perfectly understandable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the situation we have here. There is some waste, which was produced years ago, which needs to be treated at the appropriate and safest facilities. The capacity to do that resides with the people at Lucas Heights. To oppose this regulation because there is a remote chance that some waste may have to go to the Lucas Heights facility really means that that is a determination that it is not suitable for Lucas Heights&mdash;and it should stay in St Marys. It is not going to disappear. It is not a regulation to give us the magic capacity to make it disappear overnight. It is saying, `Do not send it to Lucas Heights. Please keep it in St Marys.' It is also saying, `Do not apply the appropriate methods for the safe treatment of this radioactive waste&mdash;keep it in its current condition.' Those seem to me to be flawed proposals. There is no perfect proposal for dealing with this. We have a series of options. We have to choose which is the best of the various alternatives before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal briefly with the question of consultation. I am not saying that it is unimportant, but it does not go to the core of why people are voting for or against this proposal, although it may influence the degree of their concern. My advice&mdash;I have not been involved in any of the consultations directly&mdash;is that there has been significant consultation with groups affected by the transfer of the waste at St Marys: the various environmental authorities, representatives at Woomera and various other relevant community and interest groups. There are further consultations under way. Final transport and storage arrangements will require the approval of the Commonwealth EPA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to say, rather than establishing that this regulation does not create the perfect circumstance, is, `What happens if we oppose it? What happens if this motion is carried?' What should be done then with any waste that does need the specialised facilities at Lucas Heights? What are the alternatives? They are not limitless. We can leave it at St Marys forever. We can transport it to Woomera in an untreated condition, but there will be no facilities there to treat it properly. We can condition it at St Marys without the proper equipment or pay significant extra costs to bring in a foreign organisation to undertake the conditioning. Just because this act precludes ANSTO from doing it, it does not preclude somebody else from doing it. There are skilled international companies, I am advised, which have a capacity comparable with ANSTO. We could get them to come in and do it; it just costs a lot of money and gets an American to do it, instead of the appropriate Australian authorities. That would be a very strange outcome to be pursuing&mdash;a very perverse outcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the regulation is disallowed, we will have the perverse result that, in response to genuinely held environmental concerns, the waste at St Marys would be kept less safe, allegedly in the name of protecting the public. What the government wants to do is allow ANSTO to have the authority to condition the St Marys waste. We have taken all reasonable steps to limit the regulation to this purpose. Once we have given the guarantee, we accept that although our intention has always been that limited intent, the regulation is open to wider interpretation. That was not our intention; and we will correct it as I have indicated and will reiterate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that Senator Schacht wrote to Senator Hill recently giving various assurances about consultation and limiting the effect of the regulation. I have seen the correspondence between Senator Schacht and Senator Hill. I do not think there is any controversy about the fact that it took place. On behalf of the government, I reiterate the commitment that if this disallowance motion is rejected, the government will introduce on the first practicable day, which I am informed is 7 November, a regulation incorporating a sunset clause of 31 December 1995. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We made the point, however, that we believe that it would be irresponsible of us, in the light of the government's record in these matters, to allow it a much wider discretion than what is included in the current regulation. The minister has said that he is prepared to meet our request to the extent of putting a time limit upon dealing with this waste until the end of next year. Senator Schacht had also communicated that to me. The trouble is that it does not overcome the concern that the waste that may end up having to be removed from St Marys to Lucas Heights might also end up being stored there indefinitely, for different reasons. It might be that the material cannot be made sufficiently safe for transport to Woomera. There seems to be uncertainty about these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also a clear dispute between us and the government as to whether the government is able to limit its regulation to deal solely with making safe the material at St Marys and transporting it to Woomera.

I think that is something which ought to be explored further. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said that an amended regulation to provide the sunset clause could be ready by 7 November. It seems to me that, rather than vote on this motion today, a better alternative would be that it be adjourned until 7 November and that, in the meantime, this question of law as to the capacity of the regulation to be limited to dealing with waste at St Marys, in terms of making it safe and transporting it, be considered by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee so that it can advise the Senate in order that we have that advice&mdash;getting it should be a relatively simple procedure&mdash;by the time this debate would be resumed on 7 November. </PARA>

<PARA>I first spoke on this matter on 6 June when the Senate had tabled the preceding declaration, which was a one-month temporary declaration, by the same minister on the same tropic. My speech is in the Senate <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> and has been referred to by a number of people who have been interested in this matter ever since. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 11 June I made a submission to the minister's appointed person to conduct an inquiry, Professor Cheryl Saunders, who received my submission along with very many from others in South Australia. Her report was given to the minister, and this led to his making on 9 July a declaration which has the effect of placing a 25-year ban upon the Hindmarsh Island bridge. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a bridge that was to be built under agreement between the South Australia government and a major developer of Hindmarsh Island, but to advantage not only that development but all the residents of the lower Murray area, and in particular the residents of Hindmarsh Island. There is a ferry that operates from Goolwa on the mainland across the 100 metres or so to a causeway on the island. This ferry has operated for decades. It is costing the South Australian taxpayer a considerable amount of money. In making the decision to build the bridge to replace the ferry, the South Australian government has noted the savings that would flow in terms of maintenance and operational costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By having a bridge instead of a ferry we have the advantage of a permanent access&mdash;with no delays&mdash;to move from the island to the mainland. At some times of the day in summer there are delays of at least half an hour, sometimes one hour, to get on board the ferry because so many people want to go to</PARA>
<PARA>or fro at the one time. The residents on the island are concerned to have access to hospital treatment in an emergency, and they also want the normal facility of easy access from their homes to the rest of the region&mdash;indeed to the city of Adelaide&mdash;without this impediment of delay. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bridge is of vital importance to the developer of a marina and to the residents who have already taken allotments in a real estate development around the marina. They have a legitimate interest to protect. Not only is the facility of direct benefit to them, but the bridge was promised. It was not just a promise by the South Australian government; a contract to build the bridge was fully entered into by the South Australia government, and many people based investment decisions on the fact that such a bridge would be built. There are 800 allotments for 800 families who already have acted on the basis of that expectation. Many more families are long time residents of Hindmarsh Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 6 June in the Senate I mentioned that I am broadly familiar with this region. It is not only part of the electorate that I have represented for the last 17 years, but it is also an area that I have visited since I was a boy. I regularly sail in the lower Murray areas with my family, and I walk in the Coorong National Park. To get to the national park I have to go from Goolwa to Hindmarsh Island and sail through the lock in the barrage and down through to the Murray mouth and around to Tauwitchere and into the Coorong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go there because I love the area. I love the birds and the natural state of the area, which in the Coorong National Park is largely unspoiled. The people of Hindmarsh Island and the developer want to keep it that way. In fact, it is a legally binding commitment that in any developments on the island measures will be taken to preserve every element of the natural heritage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This was an extraordinary intervention by the Commonwealth Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island Affairs, Mr Tickner to ban the bridge on the basis of a report by Professor Saunders. That report includes material which cannot be disclosed publicly. Any argument or evidence that is put forward in the report is too flimsy for a decision by any of us in the Senate, let alone by the Commonwealth minister who is required to be accountable to this Parliament and to the Australian public for the decisions that are made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will argue four propositions. Firstly, I believe that the Senate should disallow this declaration by the minister so as to ensure justice for all Australians. Secondly, I believe that the declaration should be disallowed by the Senate to ensure credibility of Aboriginal claims. I will explain why I do not believe that the basis for this declaration, in so far as it relates to Aboriginal beliefs or concerns, is sufficiently sound to be credible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thirdly, I will argue that all governments should be accountable. They cannot make decisions affecting thousands of people&mdash;and, by implication, all Australians&mdash;without accountability, without an explanation that adds up to everybody concerned. I have a strong, well established record of direct concern for the natural environment and direct concern for Aboriginal issues, Aboriginal concerns and Aboriginal priorities. I believe that the lack of credibility for the Aboriginal issues involved in this matter reflects badly, and indeed reflects discredit, upon the whole process that this parliament wants to establish for the genuine protection of Aboriginal beliefs and Aboriginal sites. If we allow the currency to be debased in this way, we are putting in jeopardy the valuable principles of the protection of Aboriginal heritage where it can genuinely and credibly be attested to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fourthly, I believe that the Senate should disallow this declaration to ensure that there are fair foundations for development and enterprise in Australia. Developers and investors need to know with assurance from the earliest stages of any proposal that there is a legal certainty on which they can act and so get on with their development efficiently and effectively and meet all of the requirements of environment impact statements and the like that are required in the preliminary stage. In this case full approval for this development, which included the bridge, was given in April 1990&mdash;four and a half years ago&mdash;and the company involved has a $15 million debt. It is a $175 million development which has been reversed or stopped by the declaration of a Commonwealth minister on the basis of very flimsy evidence to which I will now refer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the first proposition, the Senate should disallow this declaration on the basis of justice for all Australians, Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, and equally for all the residents in this part of South Australia. The Fleurieu Regional Development Corporation commissioned an economic study related to the bridge, and this professional report has concluded that the banning of the bridge will mean the loss of 1200 new jobs and an economic loss of $175 million to the region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is therefore understandable that hundreds of local people rallied in Goolwa and demonstrated that they wanted the bridge to go ahead. Not only have there been many articles, statements and newsletters issued by those supporting the bridge, but also weekly meetings on Hindmarsh Island, one of which I have addressed. I can inform the Senate of the genuine concerns of these ordinary Australians. Certainly, they have a direct personal interest in the outcome, but we ought to take that fairly into account and give them justice. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to these two documents. It has become quite clear that the so-called women's issues involving the Ngarrindjeri women were never heard of by state government, by local government or by local residents until April this year&mdash;four years after the development was approved by the state government and some years after various Aboriginal heritage matters were put to the South Australian government for exploration, all of which led to a green light from the Aboriginal heritage section of the South Australian government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main spokesman for the Ngarrindjeri women was a Mrs Doreen Kartinyeri. She wrote to Mr Tickner on 12 May and said that she had only recently discovered the significance of the Hindmarsh Island region to Aboriginal women. She was the chief spokesman for those women. She said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">"I have always known about the stories associated with the Raminyeri and Ngarrindjeri women's business but until recently I did not know the exact place that they referred to . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I commend Mrs Kartinyeri for her honesty. I have no argument with her or her friends. She has been honest. She does not live in the area; she lives in Cape York Peninsula. I do not know of any Ngarrindjeri women, besides her. The Ngarrindjeri men whom I have met in the area do not know of any Ngarrindjeri women still living in the lower Murray. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have yet to hear from anybody as to whether there are more than five Ngarrindjeri women. There are certainly fewer than 35 Ngarrindjeri women because all of the Aboriginal network in South Australia, including the Kauna and other Aboriginal groups in the state, came together in April and May to demonstrate and to lobby. This included people who were not Ngarrindjeri. Out of the group of 35, I do not know whether there are more than five who are left. The one put forward as the spokesman said that she did not know the site was significant to the women's issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are these women's issues? I will try to be guarded because I have not read the secret envelopes. The lower Murray region is quite reasonably seen to represent for some Aboriginal women an analogy&mdash;a dreaming&mdash;associated with reproduction and the birth of children. It is an important element of life for all communities in all times. We are not aware of the detail of this; but, with regard to a bridge being built between the mainland and one island, which is part of the lower Murray area, reference to Dr Fergie has been made in the public document of Professor Saunders. Dr Fergie is the anthropologist on this issue, appointed this year by the Aboriginal legal rights movement. Professor Saunders said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note also the contrasting (but equally tentative) point made by Dr Fergie in the third Appendix to her Report.</PARA>
<PARA>Dr Fergie stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whenever women were called upon to explain what was different about the barrages and the proposed bridge they referred to the water in some way. In occurs to me that it may well be that what the women haven't been able to articulate clearly is that the problem with linking Kumarangk&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is Hindmarsh Island&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and the mainland together by a bridge is precisely that a bridge goes above&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the water. It is a shore to shore, direct and permanent link. It would make that link, unlike the barrage or the ferry cable, unmediated by water. It would . . . make the system sterile.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the best account we have as to the reason for blocking the bridge. Because a bridge is unmediated by water, it is somehow offensive to the spiritual significance of the lower Murray region for maybe five women. I respect the spiritual beliefs and views and anything that is dearly held by those five women, but they themselves did not know what the significance of this area was until April this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When they tried to explain it through their anthropologist to Professor Saunders, they could not articulate it. I do not blame people for not being able to articulate things, but even now it does not make any sense. There is no explanation. No explanation has been given by the minister. No explanation has been given by Professor Saunders. We are putting in jeopardy $175 million worth of development, the direct safety and concerns of the residents of Hindmarsh Island and the concerns of the mayor of Goolwa and all of his councillors, who have been elected by the local people, because a bridge is unmediated by water. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does it mean that there is some fear amongst the four or five women that there would not be live births or that their spiritual belief would somehow be obstructed or compromised? That is not being put forward. There is no logic in the explanation. If there is logic, please may we all be enlightened. The government is not being accountable and it is a failure of accountability for a minister to stop a bridge on the basis of such a flimsy reference to the spiritual beliefs of some Aboriginal Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agreed with the minister when he spoke with me personally that we should all have due concern for the spiritual beliefs of all Australians&mdash;of course we must.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . no sane society can take far-reaching government decisions largely on the basis of sealed evidence which someone simply asserts is in some way sacred or taboo and therefore to remain sealed from discovery.</PARA>
<PARA>I have the genuine view that this evidence was contrived to meet the concerns of the environmental lobby which had failed to stop the bridge. It was not known to the South Australian government. This matter, even in its non-explained state, does not exist on any anthropological records anywhere in South Australia. A burden was placed upon a few Aboriginal women to come up with some culturally significant sacred matter that could be used as a basis to help the environmentalists with whom they were working to block the bridge.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not call into question the bona fides of Mrs Kartinyeri or the other Aboriginal women themselves but I believe that they were used and, even then, when they were used, the explanation does not stack up. The minister, Mr Tickner, in his press release of 10 July said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the reconciliation process is to be meaningful&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he means reconciliation between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians&mdash;a concept, a goal that I strongly support. I say that most sincerely&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it is especially important that the spiritual beliefs of Aboriginal people be accorded no lesser respect than the spiritual beliefs of non Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA>I say the same to Mr Tickner with regard to the spiritual beliefs of the other residents of the lower Murray region of South Australia. Let us pay equal, fair and just regard to the beliefs, interests and concerns of everybody involved in this area. Where there is no explanation by a tiny minority to the overwhelming majority who want the bridge, let the explanation be all the more carefully and credibly put forward. There has been a complete failure to do so in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already discussed with Minister Tickner the need, in order to establish fair foundations for development and enterprise, to amend the current 1984 act so that any concern of this nature is dealt with at the environmental impact stage before major investment takes place with regard to any development anywhere in Australia. I am heartened that Mr Tickner acknowledges that and wants to amend the act to ensure that any such declaration by a minister in this regard is made at an early stage in any development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But let it be fully understood that in Australia we have a requirement to work according to law. There is a fundamental principle at stake here and that is the need to uphold the certainty of legal approvals. In this case the original full environmental development approval was given by the South Australian government in April 1990, four and a half years ago. Three matters were referred to the Aboriginal heritage branch of the South Australian government. They were dealt with on 8 May 1992, 9 November 1993 and, finally, on 3 May 1994 and they all concluded that the bridge should go ahead. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that, so far as South Australia is concerned, there was a tardy four-year process before construction on the bridge commenced.

<PARA>The Industry Commission is reliable and consistent. It can be relied on to consistently argue the same line irrespective of the problems and irrespective of the industry. In this petrol report we have recommendations of widespread deregulation of the petrol industry. Ignoring the fact that petrol industries in all countries are so dominated by a small number of players that virtually every  other country in the world has opted for some level of regulation, the Industry Commission has argued that self-regulation and no regulation are the best way to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The inevitable result of this would be further concentration of distributors and retailers in the ownership of the oil companies, resulting in even less competition and higher prices for rural people. When the Industry Commission itself concedes that its policy recommendations may result in a minority of country residents paying more for petrol, rural Australia should get very worried. I can understand why the government chose to sit on this report for three months, then release a statement which commits itself to none of it, but promises further reviews, inquiries and consultations. What is urgently needed in this country is a competitive wholesale distribution market for petrol. That is the best guarantee that country customers will get lower petrol prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission's recommendations will not deliver that and neither will further government procrastination. Only pro-active, pro-competition, pro-consumer policy action will deliver that. As well as failing to address the city/country petrol price disparities, the Industry Commission has failed to address the urgent need for an environmental clean-up within the petroleum industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that the government has decided on both counts to largely ignore the commission's report, but this leaves us wondering why we bother having an Industry Commission which costs $27 million a year. The Democrats oppose much of the legislative reforms proposed by the commission and urge the government to keep the needs of consumers&mdash;especially country consumers&mdash;very much in mind when deciding on its final response to the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I was in North Queensland in August, petrol prices in Townsville were 8c a litre higher than those in Brisbane; in Cairns and Mackay, 9c higher; and in Mossman&mdash;in far North Queensland&mdash;10c higher. That means that the average family in Townsville pays an extra $160 a year to run the family car. High country petrol prices contribute to geographic discrimination, making it more expensive for businesses to operate in country areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission attempts to argue that the differential between city and country prices is largely explained by freight costs. However, the commission's own data shows that only about half of the difference in costs between New South Wales and Queensland towns can be explained by freight. The simple fact is that the current petrol pricing system is failing rural people, and this report will do little to improve it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Here we have another one of these wonderful Industry Commission reports that come out from time to time! I will let others outline the problems for consumers and retailers and point out the environmental folly of allowing fluctuations in price that negate any attempt at disincentive or incentive. I will talk about the Industry Commission's approach.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting because, in its report, the Industry Commission starts by outlining a situation where the market is essentially controlled by five companies. This makes it an oligopoly. It also notes that the companies frequently collude with each other&mdash;acting as a cartel&mdash;and this has been alluded to already by Senator Woodley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Economic fundamentalists can rant all they want to about government interference, but no real economist worth his or her salt believes that an oligopolistic cartel-dominated market works the way Adam Smith or Ricardo said it was supposed to. Smith and Ricardo said that it did not, and that the result was a form of distortion of the classical market&mdash;market failure. When a player or players dominate the market, the principle of normal competitive adjustment cannot function, according to classical economists not tied to an ideology that says that privatisation and lack of control is automatically the solution, regardless of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whenever there is an element controlling the market, it does not work in an unbiased way. When government is the controller, there is a distortion of the market introduced by the community as a whole to achieve social goals. Minimal government intervention is anti-trust action&mdash;action designed to stop the domination of a market by one player or a few players. The classic example of monopoly dominance, and of trust-busting legislation introduced to stop it, was the case of the Rockefeller oil companies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Domination by a cartel or oligopoly also creates a distortion of the market&mdash;except that while government, in principle, represents the people, a cartel or oligopoly represents only the interests of certain corporations. Senator Boswell mentioned that we have a Trade Practices Act, but while this cartel is operating so effectively, that act is obviously not operating, is it? Because of its direct dominance of market transaction&mdash;its power as a price setter&mdash;it can usually introduce greater distortion in a market than all but the most heavily interventionist government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the situation that the Industry Commission has outlined as existing&mdash;a five member, globally-based oligopoly acting as a cartel and dominating the Australian market. The Industry Commission outlines specific mechanisms where the distortion generates profits for the cartel at the expense of consumers generally, including business consumers; at the expense of rural consumers specifically&mdash;as was mentioned by Senator Woodley; at the expense of petrol retailers, both franchisees and independent operators; at the expense of social factors&mdash;that is, government attempts to introduce incentives and disincentives environmentally and therefore at the expense of the environment; at the expense of workers and their families; and, through their taxes and business taxes, at the expense of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For this reason, a number of laws have been enacted in this place&mdash;price controls, the site act and the franchise act&mdash;designed to assure some measure of justice and some resemblance to the classic market. The oligopoly still significantly distorts the market, as outlined by the Industry Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point, the Industry Commission report starts to lose any credibility. The conclusion it draws from this situation is that most regulations should be eliminated. The site act and the franchise act should be repealed, in spite of strong calls by retailers and franchisors to retain them. The Industry Commission argues that since the victims of the cartel remain victims&mdash;being inadequately protected&mdash;the solution is to eliminate any protection afforded them. I find this astounding. It is one of the reasons that I would fight against having an inquiry referred to the Industry Commission. Its members are doctors who prescribe more leeches for any complaint, including anaemia! They suggest that somehow the anti-trust laws are an impediment to self-regulation and assume that somehow self-regulation would obviously and automatically result in greater justice and less market distortion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These five big companies are admittedly at their most dangerous when acting in concert as a cartel, but the suggestion is that somehow getting those five big companies together to regulate the market will save things. Somehow, describing a cartel set up to regulate its own market as `self-regulation' is supposed to eliminate any selfish moves or self-interest from these companies' actions. It is a bit like believing in the invisible hands or the peace dividend.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain that all honourable senators received letters, as we did, from people complaining about the petrol companies and outlining the lack of options that tie them up. If the Industry Commission had any integrity, it would have made recommendations as to how the existing laws could be made stronger or made to work better, or it would have made other laws that could be drafted. Asking for self-regulation is asking for the sharks to go on a diet. Please!</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be that the Democrats have done  away with that policy, but it is still on the record as being their last policy. I admired Senator Woodley for pointing out the difference between the cost of living in the city and that in remote areas and also for saying that transport was not the only factor in this. Much of the difference does relate to transport, but not all. I agree with him on that. But I believe that if the cost of living in the city and in the country is to be brought more into line, we should start by bringing down the price of fuel. The government forever uses the price of fuel as a milking machine to put more into its coffers for its programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree that something should be done to bring the situation back into kilter but, unfortunately, Senator Woodley's good thoughts on this matter were spoilt by the fact that the Democrats' policy&mdash;and I have not read anywhere that they have withdrawn it&mdash;is to raise the price of fuel by 18c a litre throughout Australia. That would put up the costs in the city and, of course, the costs in the country would be magnified a thousand times. I suggest to Senator Woodley that before he jumps up and tries to lead people in the remote areas&mdash;and I know the Democrats are trying to do this; in South Australia and New South Wales, they are trying to take over from the National Party&mdash;his party should look at its policy in relation to fuel and adjust it accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Industry Commission report on petroleum products. To continue with the point that Senator Panizza was making, anyone listening to the senators from the Australian Democrats or the Greens and who wants to blame the cost of fuel in rural or metropolitan Australia on some international conspiracy by oil companies should be reminded that it was those same senators who voted for an increase in the price of fuel when this government broke its promise shortly after the last federal election and, from 1 August, the Australian people had to pay an extra cent per litre.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But not only did those senators vote to increase the cost of fuel; they also voted to ensure that the government was given a pat on the back for breaking a promise that it made to the Australian people before the last election. Mr Keating promised no new taxes; he promised tax cuts. Yet these people voted to increase taxes, particularly taxes on petrol.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Acting Deputy President, tonight we are debating the Industry Commission report on petroleum products. The major recommendations of that report are: to terminate the prices surveillance arrangements for petroleum products&mdash;presently the PSA sets a daily wholesale price which includes the ministerial direction on certain delivery and storage costs; and to repeal the Petroleum Retail Marketing Sites Act and the Petroleum Retail Marketing Franchise Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those recommendations certainly concern the majority of service station proprietors. As Mr Swan said in the other place, it would be tantamount to sending two rugby teams onto a field without a referee. It would absolutely devastate the retail petroleum distributors, who are already having a very difficult time at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned for one of the proprietors in my electorate who is forced by his lease to work from seven in the morning till 10 at night. If he does not meet those terms, his lease will be terminated. He cannot sell the business because no-one else is prepared to work 15 hours a day, seven days a week. That is the sort of situation that must be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another recommendation is for the strengthening of self-regulation under the oil code. I would support that, except for the fact that the Trade Practices Commissioner, Professor Fels, has suggested that it would be a form of collusion; that there can be no discussion on prices when oil companies and retailers come together. That puts them at a terrible disadvantage; they cannot even talk prices in case they offend the Trade Practices Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the other recommendation that most people would support is the recommendation for the removal of the Laidely agreement, an agreement between the Transport Workers Union and the Australian Petroleum Agents and Distributors Association which sets certain awards for defined delivery areas for tanker drivers employed by the major oil companies. That is believed to be one of the major factors in the cost of fuel delivery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also recommends&mdash;I certainly support this&mdash;an extended diesel fuel rebate scheme, increasing it to 100 per cent of the diesel tax. Such a rebate would affect mining and all other areas that do not use road transport. Of course, the cost would be astronomical. The government has been cautious in its response to that recommendation. In fact, the government has walked away from this report for three months and, when it finally brought down its response, it was fairly cautious. It has said that it will review prices surveillance policy after the Competition Commission reports in 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will need to be convinced that such arrangements for industry self-regulation are in place before consideration will be given to a review of the relevant legislation. I for one will hold the government accountable for that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industry Commission is a very useful organisation in that it brings together information that is necessary to the making of sane decisions. In that regard, I remind the Senate of an appendix to a 1986 Industry Commission report on petroleum products in which, as I recall, it vigorously put forward the view that excise on fuel had a very disadvantageous effect on rural Australia and created distortions within and between various industries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak very briefly to the Industry Commission report on petroleum products. I remind the Senate that the extraordinarily high price of fuel in rural areas is a direct consequence of the government telling enough lies about the GST campaign before the last election to prevent a 19c a litre cut in fuel prices throughout Australia. The GST meant cheaper petrol. The area that would have benefited most from that was in fact rural Australia. If one were in business in rural Australia, petrol prices would have fallen by 26c a litre as a result of the removal of these taxes on fuel. There were some people in this chamber who took the view that that would not be beneficial in the cities because of pollution considerations, and that is a respectable view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fact is that the rejection of the GST, with the consequential massive fall in the cost of distribution of products through the bush and in the cost of fuel for use by people in country areas who do not have the benefit of massively subsidised public transport systems&mdash;a failure due to a campaign of deception and dishonesty&mdash;has had an enormous effect on the costs of fuel in the country. Of course, this government has imposed additional imposts on fuel users in the bush. I think the Australian public should be reminded of the consequences of that dishonest and disgraceful campaign against the GST, which resulted in the coalition not being elected to government and in rural users not getting the benefit of a massive reduction in fuel prices. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a file two feet thick, in the old measurements, on this issue, which really is an ongoing concern for country people. They have one particular concern, and that is why the city prices for petrol are between 13c and 20c higher in some areas&mdash;I am told by the honourable member for Parkes, Mr Cobb, that the prices can be as much as 20c a litre higher in the Dubbo area&mdash;than they are in the main metropolitan areas. This report does not tackle that. It does not tackle the fundamental question in relation to petrol pricing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I concede the point that the government's tax upon petrol, the excise tax, has been an almighty burden upon the retailers and, indeed, the users&mdash;the businesses and the households of Australia. It is being used as no more than a revenue raiser and less and less each year is going back into the roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That issue aside, the Industry Commission report has not tackled the fundamental issue that concerns at least country people&mdash;why is there a difference in price? Five major oil companies have been accused of getting together on a daily basis to set the wholesale price. That allegation is made against the oil companies. When that allegation is put to them, of course they reject it. They give the same tired old argument that the difference is simply no more than transport costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I have heard the argument that the difference between the country and the city prices is transport costs. On investigation, that is absolute rubbish. In my own state of Victoria, I have charted each drop-off point, each town, to which petrol supplies go. The Prices Surveillance Authority has published the cost of transporting the petrol and that cost is never more than 2c to 3c per litre. That does not make up for the 13c to 20c difference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have produced those charts to the petrol companies. There has been no response. I would have thought that the Industry Commission report would have tackled that very important and serious issue. If that is no longer an argument, why is there a difference between the prices? We are unable to be given a explanation in respect of this fundamental difference. Are the prices being manipulated? That seems to be more to the truth. The fact is that the vicious discounting that is going on in the metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne is being subsidised by higher prices in the country areas, where there is less competition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have only to turn to the Victorian Premier, Mr Kennett, to get substance for that argument because of late he has reported the five oil companies to the Prices Surveillance Authority. When he was taking a trip through my home district of Gippsland, it was brought to his attention that each town that he passed through that day suspiciously had the same petrol prices that were being charged in the city. But the prices were higher in those country towns the day before and the day after. How can that possibly be? The premier of Victoria did not believe it either. He has reported the five oil companies to the Prices Surveillance Authority. He wants the authority to inquire into why there was this gyrating of petrol prices in Victoria when he happened to be tripping through the country area. We await that report with great interest.

I know that many areas of  Australia are afflicted by this natural disaster, but tonight I would like to focus for a couple of minutes on the Upper Hunter region of New South Wales.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Scone Rural Lands Protection Board area has been drought declared now for 23 of the last 42 months. The drought started in Scone when it was drought declared for nine months in a row in 1991. The area was drought declared for 16 months in 1991-92. The Merriwa and Mudgee rural lands protection boards have been similarly affected. The New South Wales Department of Agriculture estimates that the Upper Hunter will have to destock approximately 150,000 cattle within the next two months if rain does not come very shortly. Many cattle will have to be shot because they are not saleable, and 15,000 are expected to die of starvation before then. Sixty percent of what is going through the abattoirs across the eastern states at the moment are females, so one can understand the effect that is having on the national gene pool, a gene pool that has been built up for generations and belongs not only to farmers but to each and every Australian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Collins, has two concerns over a drought fodder subsidy which was proposed by the coalition's response to the drought. He says that it will highly inflate grain prices and that the 1982-83 experience was an example of considerable rorting of the system. Both those allegations really hold no water. Government research shows that grain prices rose only 23 per cent during the 1982-83 drought, and much of that was due to the inflationary impact of the drought anyway. People who are in the market and buying grain at the moment would know that wheat prices have increased nearly 100 per cent in the past six weeks from $165 a tonne to about $230 a tonne today, and that maize, one of the best feeds for sheep, has increased in the past two weeks, if one can get it, from $230 a tonne to around about $300 a tonne on farm. With regard to any talk of rorting of the system, I am not aware of any farmer who was convicted of any such action in the 1982-83 drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Scone, Merriwa and Mudgee have now been excluded from the original list of exceptional drought areas after hopes were raised during the much vaunted satellite link-up with the Department of Social Security which the minister had proposed as a way of explaining the government's drought package to interested people. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="CX5">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some of the areas have been in drought much longer than that, as Senator Baume points out. Andrew Badgery, the rural counsellor in the area, has spoken at four drought meetings with up to 100 people at each meeting telling them that they fitted the criteria for assistance. Of the 150 applications made for drought family payment through the New South Wales Rural Assistance Authority, half came from the drought affected area in the Upper Hunter region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Collins's office is saying that it was a bureaucratic mistake to put Scone, Merriwa and Mudgee on the television list, or maybe the Department of Primary Industries and Energy realised that the Upper Hunter was harder hit than the minister thought. The rural counsellor has estimated that it was going to cost $5 million to $6 million each for Scone, Merriwa and Mudgee rural lands protection boards. He has estimated that the Upper Hunter would be eligible for about $20 million in family assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many farms in the Upper Hunter have been severely affected by drought for periods well in excess of 23 months out of the last 42. Individual properties can have had no rain for six months and not be drought declared because at least half of the rural lands protection board is not drought-declared. After much media fanfare surrounding the Prime Minister's drought tour, it is now revealed how inadequate this much heralded response is, although I do applaud the main thrust of what the government is trying to do. It is better late than never. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How can the government say to neighbouring farmers that one is in an exceptional drought circumstance, eligible for assistance, and the other is not? How can the government say to a farmer who cannot put food on his table, has borrowed tens of thousands of dollars to keep his stock alive&mdash;stock that has had to be shot or sold anyway&mdash;that 23 months of drought declaration is not long enough for him to have suffered?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The drought in the Upper Hunter is so severe that it is threatening the viability of even the best farmers in the region. Farmers have given up their lifestyles, their health and their children's education to minimise debt and maintain their herds at all costs. It would give farmers some hope if the guidelines for the drought package were relaxed slightly. I ask the government to assess each rural lands protection board individually and relax the rigid eligibility criteria. What is to be done for those farmers who miss out on assistance because they do not fall within a geographical area defined by the government?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How we assist these farmers is a matter of identification. It is the government's problem, but those farmers must be identified. As has already been pointed out, 96 per cent of Australian farmers will receive nothing from the government's package and are battling on against the problems of the drought; 100 per cent of small businesses, many of them in the Upper Hunter, will receive nothing. The minister must relax criteria to include all who are suffering severe drought. Combined with high interest rates, low commodity prices, high costs and an unsympathetic government that has done virtually nothing to allow farmers to prepare for severe drought, the drought will cost all Australians dearly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuation of the present circumstances will cause great anxiety and hurt to farming families and rural communities. It will cause great anxiety to the rest of Australia because we will see rising food prices, which we have actually seen already, of at least five per cent, and a flow-on to the CPI of around two per cent, so it will be very inflationary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Already we have seen the second worst current account in the September quarter, which will only be exacerbated as the drought continues, and that certainly has not started to flow into the current account yet. We have seen higher government borrowings as the deficit blows out, which will mean higher interest rates, and we have the highest real interest rates of the OECD. This drought is impacting on the very fabric of Australia. I wish this government were more sympathetic and more understanding of the drought's impact. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concern that I wish to express tonight is a real concern for one of the government ministers, Senator Faulkner, who in the debate about Port Hinchinbrook has been very much sidelined. Furthermore, the authority of the Federal government as an environmental watchdog has also been made irrelevant. That is my concern. I quote in evidence of that concern from a number of articles. The first is an article from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sunday Mail</EMPHASIS> of last Sunday by Phil Dickie entitled `The Slow Track to Club Mud' from which I now quote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Instead of environmental impact assessment, the Port Hinchinbrook proposal became the subject of an "Environmental Review Report". This was announced as the work of the Department of Environment and Heritage, but Freedom of Information requests show that the developer, Keith Williams, through the Office of the Coordinator-General, played a large hand in the final form of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>I have some quotes from his correspondence with the department:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"My suggestions for amendments to this report are not negotiable . . . (they) must be incorporated before (the report) is released to the public," wrote Mr Williams. Within a week, the Office of the Coordinator-General advised Mr Williams of 10 pages of amendments and the final document was further amended in response to such further notations as "This must go" and "Under no circumstances will I agree to this".</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would seem, at the very least, that attributing authorship of the Environmental Review Report to the Department of Environment and Heritage is highly misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some questions have been raised with me in a number of quarters. Again, these questions suggest to me that Senator Faulkner has been ambushed. That concerns me greatly because I believe that he has a very real commitment to the environment. But questions have been raised and I wonder whether Minister Faulkner is aware of recent reports that Queensland's most senior public servant, Mr Kevin Rudd, and the head of the Queensland Department of Environment and Heritage, Dr Craig Emerson, are both considering nominating for endorsement as candidates for the ALP at the next federal election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the minister is aware that the two departments headed by these men are the same two departments involved in assessing and approving the Port Hinchinbrook development in Far North Queensland, the same development which the Valentine Report, commissioned by the minister, has criticised as likely to threaten the World Heritage values of this area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether the minister is aware that the AWU faction of the ALP in Queensland is likely to support both these men in their candidacy. I wonder whether the minister is aware&mdash;perhaps he is aware and it causes him pain as well as it causes me pain&mdash;that any future work force at Port Hinchinbrook resort would be required to become members of the AWU. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One has to marvel at the apparent conflict of interest of Mr Rudd and Dr Emerson and ask whether they have contributed to the farcical and inadequate nature of the approval process followed by the Queensland government for the Port Hinchinbrook development. It is not only Mr Williams, Mr Rudd, Dr Emerson, the AWU and others who have sidelined Senator Faulkner. Again, let me read from a press release:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today in question time, when I asked Senator Cook representing the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to explain whether Australians should do what the Reserve Bank and the Treasurer say is in Australia's best interest&mdash;that is, not join in the boom in real estate investment&mdash;or whether they should do the opposite and follow the lead of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), I got as usual the spray of personal abuse that is the answer to every matter I ever raise of any substance in this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we recognise that there is a point of principle involved that is far more important, and that is that when a Prime Minister significantly increases his exposure to the risk of debt&mdash;apparently in this case of the Prime Minister purchasing a $2.2 million mansion in Woollahra, well above the $1 million mark&mdash;after he is elected, there is clear merit in his revealing such a change to the public. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Under existing cabinet rules all ministers are required to reveal such changes to their Prime Minister, although this did not apply to Mr Keating. When Mr Keating was Treasurer in May 1991 he failed to tell his Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, the details of his $430,000 purchase of a half interest in a piggery group. But breaking the rules is nothing new to Mr Keating: he has made it an art form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Prime Ministers who otherwise would have to report only to themselves when they made such significant changes in their financial arrangements should instead&mdash;it seems to me as a matter of principle&mdash;either reveal the details of these changes to the Australian people or else refrain from major commercial undertakings while they are Prime Minister of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proprieties that should be observed in such a situation obviously mean nothing to this Prime Minister, who now clearly has a very significant vested interest in government policy affecting both the inflation rate and interest rates; a vested interest he did not have when he came before the Australian people and asked to be elected as their Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a significant matter of principle. The Prime Minister has to report to nobody but himself when he changes the enormous exposure that he now has to debt; whereas ministers of the Crown, under the very rules in recognition of the potential for conflict of interest, have to report to the Prime Minister&mdash;unless, of course, the Prime Minister happens to be Bob Hawke at the time and the minister involved happens to be Paul Keating, who does not talk to Mr Hawke. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter of principle is obviously too difficult for this government to understand. I suppose one should note that the sort of criticism that I have been getting for raising this issue, and the mumbling and rumbling around the gallery by the Prime Minister's henchmen from aNiMaLS to attack me once again is based on one simple proposition. The only defence that the government had was to quote an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Daily Telegraph Mirror</EMPHASIS> today. It called what I was doing `the politics of envy'. That kind of hypocrisy in that editorial and in the Labor Party's whingeing today about my daring to criticise the Prime Minister is fascinating. </PARA>

While he was a half-owner of the piggery, it lost millions of dollars&mdash;and $4.5 million was written off by the Commonwealth Bank as a bad debt. This was while Mr Keating was the half-owner.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was my melancholy duty nearly 12 months ago to attend the funeral service at RAAF Base Amberley of an F111 crew who had been killed a few days earlier. Today, a very brief statement&mdash;a two-page summary&mdash;of the investigations into the accident which involved this No. 1 Squadron aircraft was tabled in the Senate. This brief document is the only reference I have to the events as they occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of military training, as you would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, is such that it can never be risk free. But it can be conducted safely&mdash;and it must be conducted safely. The nature of the exercises that the services are involved in is such that, when they are performed, a very high degree of skill is required. That skill comes from repeated training and great familiarity with the tasks they have to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The task that was required of this aircraft this night was to do a number of simulated bombing attacks. It involved the use of the terrain-following radar which the F111 has. The aircraft is flown, in this case at night, probably in bad weather&mdash;I do not know about that, but there is a reference to IMC conditions in the latter part of the report&mdash;at a height of between 250 and 400 feet, just subsonically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have flown in, and I have flown, F111s in that role on this route to the Guyra meatworks. At best, it is a very exhilarating ride for an airman, but it is an exercise that admits of no room for any inaccuracies in the procedure. It confers a very important military capability on Australia to have this terrain-following role in the aircraft of the strike reconnaissance group. It is a role possessed by only two other countries in the Western world: Britain with the RAF and its Tornado aircraft, and the Americans with their F111s. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an important capability because the aircraft is moving very fast at a very low level. It is below radar detection levels and it is safe from ground-based missile attack unless it actually flies over the top of a missile site. It is also safe from air intercepts, because the geometry of an intercept of an F111 at 200 feet is extraordinarily difficult. The aircraft is also safe from missile attack from interceptor aircraft because of the possibility of false targets from the ground. The Royal Australian Air Force used to boast&mdash;and I do not know whether it is still true&mdash;that it was the only air force using a terrain-following capability which trained at night and in bad weather. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears from the accident report that what happened that night is that the aircraft flew to the weapons release point at the meatworks at Guyra on the northern end of the New England Tableland. At weapons release point, the procedure is for the aircraft to be rotated with a 3G pull-up to climb, and then it rolls out onto a heading to depart the target area. The allegation in the report is that the pilot failed to release the automatic coupling between the autopilot and the terrain-following radar so that, when he initiated his pull-up, he experienced higher than normal stick forces and the aeroplane did not rotate to the degree it should have. When it reached a pitch angle of between 20 and 25 degrees nose up, the terrain-following radar broke lock and an automatic safety procedure came in which initiated a vertical climb&mdash;again a 3G rotation&mdash;to clear the aircraft from the ground in case of systems failure in the terrain-following mode. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He then rolled into the approved turn and exceeded the normal bank angle of 110 degrees, which is past the vertical, and presumably went to 140 or 150 degrees. He then reversed the bank to 80 to 90 degrees and sought the heading to depart the target area. In so doing, the aircraft was flown into the ground at very high speed. Both crew members were killed and the aircraft was totally destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let no-one be under any misunderstanding about the difficulty of the circumstance, technically, that the pilot was in. It was a very fast aeroplane going just subsonically. It was very close to the ground. It may have been in bad weather&mdash;and it was night. There would have been no visual reference for the pilot to orient himself. He was faced with an abnormal set of procedures. Understandably, he would have been trying to work out just what was wrong&mdash;and probably not paying the high degree of attention that he should have been paying to the attitude of the aircraft in space. That is how the accident happened. I want to speak about the conclusions in the report. Paragraph 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Factors that may have contributed to the accident were:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">a. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilot had not practised this particular kind of attack at night for the preceding five months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">b.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilot may have been distracted when he possibly realised that he had omitted to disengage the Auto TF system on pull-up initiation during the attack, or by some other unknown factor such as an aircraft component or system failure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">c.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pilot may have suffered from channelised attention due to task saturation&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, seeking the heading to depart the target area&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">d.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Confusion over the unexpected behaviour of the aircraft may have caused him to focus on what was going wrong, to the detriment of situational awareness and the primary task of controlling the aircraft safely.</PARA>
<PARA>I find it absolutely astonishing that a pilot should be required to perform a task of that complexity and that danger and not have had any training or practice in it for five months. There would not be a more difficult role for the Australian Strike Reconnaissance Group to fly than that low level, terrain-following attack mission. The question must be asked as to why those five months had elapsed. Was it an administrative oversight within the squadron itself, or was it due to a shortage of funds to the defence department?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, my assumption is that this is part of the price we pay for the continual cuts we have seen in the defence budget. It is not possible without continual training to fly safely and with the degree of precision required in the roles that we demand of our strike reconnaissance pilots or of our fighter pilots. They are like concert pianists: they have to be at it all the time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been flying for 30 years. I think anyone who has learnt to fly properly can always fly safely. But it is a totally different matter flying to the limits of the flight envelope of a military aircraft in very difficult circumstances. Those pilots have to be at it all the time. I believe that the reductions that we have seen progressively year by year in the number of hours that our fighter pilots and strike reconnaissance pilots fly have passed what is a safe level. We cannot ask people to perform these roles unless they are constantly at it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another contributing factor is that it may well have been the state of the simulator at Amberley. It is some years since I have flown that simulator, but it was a real antique when I flew it. I know from estimates committee hearings I have attended that provision has been made in the estimates for the upgrading of that simulator. Whether that has taken place and to what degree it has been or will be upgraded, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I come back to the point that I started with in this speech: military training is essentially dangerous. It is dangerous for the people involved. It demands a high level of skill. It can be conducted safely, and it must be conducted safely. We cannot expect strike reconnaissance pilots and fighter pilots to fly to the limits that we want them to fly unless we are supporting them with adequate money to give them adequate training. That includes both the personnel and facilities to train them and the opportunities to fly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In closing the adjournment debate I want to make a couple of brief comments. The last two speeches on the adjournment have been, in my view, chalk and cheese. Senator Michael Baume, as usual, used the adjournment debate, which he is fully entitled to do, to make strong personal attacks on the integrity of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We on this side of the chamber know that that is nothing unusual for Senator Baume. He is absolutely obsessed with the Prime Minister. I suspect he cannot put up with the idea that the Prime Minister has been politically successful in leading this country or in being in a major position over the last 11 1/2 years. Nevertheless, Senator Baume is entitled to express his views in the adjournment debate, but I do not think he has any credibility in so doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to contrast Senator Baume's remarks with the remarks of Senator MacGibbon, who raised an issue of some technical complexity for us laymen and women in the Senate about a very tragic accident in the air force where two air force officers lost their lives in a training exercise, as Senator MacGibbon explained. He obviously studied the report, and he commented on it here today in the adjournment debate. I do not know whether I can accept all the assertions that Senator MacGibbon has made, because I am a layman. I am not the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) may wish to take exception to some of the remarks that Senator MacGibbon made about the reduction in training time, the lack of resources and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether or not I agree with Senator MacGibbon, I respect the way he raised the issue as a legitimate issue to be dealt with, explaining technically for us laymen and women a very complex issue. I think that is the adjournment debate at its best. I think Senator Baume's contribution was the adjournment debate at its worst. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I imagine that Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, may choose to respond to some of the remarks Senator MacGibbon has made. Senator MacGibbon and I have previously served together on the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, and his interest in defence, particularly air force matters, is well known. Being a 30-year flier, as he announced, gives him some advantage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issues he raises in making explanations from his perspective is a correct use of the adjournment debate, even if some of us may disagree with him. I cannot disagree or agree with him because the technicalities of the matter are rather complex. I just make the comment that I think we should acknowledge a constructive contribution, even if we disagree with it, compared with the destructive contribution by Senator Baume. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications and the Arts has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Telecom has advised that its current arrangements for bond payments on standard telephone services are that a security bond will only be required when appropriate credit management assessments indicate that other conditions (such as restrictions on access to IDD) would not adequately protect Telecom's revenue. It is an option of last resort.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Telecom's requirement for a security bond for existing customers is based on their previous credit history with Telecom. New customers who have not had a telephone service in the last six months are assessed on the basis of an objective credit assessment, including any credit history for telephone services that they may have had in the past. It is not Telecom's intention to use security bonds to exclude low income earners and/or disadvantaged sectors of the community from obtaining a telephone service.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Telecom has advised that it regards this information as commercial-in-confidence.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Telecom has advised that it provides a number of payment options for low income customers. These include Telecom's Payment Card, a plastic card that is magnetically encoded with the customer's number that enables individual payments of $10 and above to be made to the account at any time. Other options are shorter billing periods such as monthly accounts that allow for more manageable bills and, if required by the customer, call control facilities including restricted access to STD and IDD.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Telecom has advised that whilst figures for write-offs for bad debts associated with the standard telephone service are not available, Total Bad Debts for the Commercial and Consumer Division, which would principally comprise bad debts associated with telephone services are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1993/94&mdash;$102.3 million</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991/92, Telecom's organisational structure was significantly different and therefore comparable figures are not available.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) Telecom has advised that it conducts an internal credit risk assessment on all customers ordering a telephone service and keeps that assessment up to date based on the customer's dealings with Telecom. However, Telecom's objective is to provide standard telephone services wherever possible to all Australians, but at the same time it must have regard to revenue protection.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information sought from potential customers varies with the nature of service sought, but currently includes name, address and telephone details, with additional identification being required in individual cases.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Was a minute prepared by the Migration and Ethnic Affairs Policy Division, dated 6 June 1989, which advised that `DEET officials were most concerned at the impact upon institutions of a sudden cessation of students from the PRC&mdash;some institutions would be bankrupted if they were required to refund fees. In addition, programs for students in other countries would have to be cancelled where institutions were dependent for viability upon the PRC component. If cessation results from actions of the PRC Government the industry has no option but to adjust as best it can. If actions by the Australian Government stopped the program the industry would presumably seek some form of redress . . .
