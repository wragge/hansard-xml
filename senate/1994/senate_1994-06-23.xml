Did he not, on 27 June 1992 when he was in the wilderness, refer to Australians as `the lingering stereotypes of gormless men and shrimps on the barbecue'?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not privy, as it were, to any conversation the Prime Minister might have had in which those words were used. If those words were used, I suppose one's reaction depends on whether they were being used geographically or judgmentally. It is well known that many of those people opposite are quite incapable of distinguishing various portions of their anatomy, one from the other. But I think even they would accept that a reasonable case could be made for a metaphorical geographical reference to Australia in those terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point is, of course, that if we are referring geographically to Australia in that sort of metaphorical way it is the case, as Prime Minister Keating said on television last night, that Australia is an island continent in the South Pacific; it is very distant from what, until recently, have been major world markets; and it is very different from what he described as the ebb and flux or the trading milieu of the developed northern hemisphere. Under those circumstances it is the case that Australia always has to do better. Australia always has to do better than other countries, being located where we are&mdash;at this end of the earth. So if Mr Keating did ever say the words that apparently have been attributed to him, they should be seen not as words of disparagement about this country but as words of encouragement.</PARA>

That is the kind of love of country we have from the Prime Minister and his family, and I think he can stand comparison with anyone else in this country</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I refer to the release this week of the results of a national hiring intention survey conducted by Kelly Recruitment Consultants which shows that job growth is expected to continue through to the July quarter, fuelled particularly by continued growth in the small to medium sized enterprise sector. Can the minister inform the Senate of the nature of the survey, its key findings and how it relates to other major indicators of business expectations?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1946" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="INDUSTRY, SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Kelly survey reports results which are bad news for the opposition because the opposition constantly tries to undermine the Australian economy. If the economy is performing well, it regards that as bad news politically because its whole demeanour in current economic debate is to try and damage the nature of the recovery. But this is good news for Australia and Australians everywhere will be pleased to see yet another indicator coming forward which points to jobs growth and increased activity in the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Kelly survey which was released earlier this week is a survey based on a sample of 2,000 Australian businesses of all sizes and across all industry sectors. Extrapolating from the results of the survey, Kelly's predict continued growth of some 80,000 jobs into the July quarter. A large share of this growth, some 35,000 jobs, is expected to come from continued growth in the manufacturing sector alone. In accordance with recent experience, much of the job growth is being generated by small to medium sized Australian companies with between 20 and 500 employees. The results are entirely consistent with all of the other major business expectation surveys that have been recently published. Yesterday at question time, in answer to a question from Senator Cooney, I dealt with the ACCI-Westpac survey on industrial trends in the economy, which indicated of course that the expectation of the business sector in manufacturing was very strong and the level of business confidence was very high.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The latest half yearly survey of Australia's largest corporations by the Business Council of Australia shows that 58 per cent have revised their capital expenditure expectations upwards in the past six months and that 60 per cent expect to lift investment by more than 10 per cent. Firms in the BCI, the top 100 companies in this country, expect their sales value to grow by five per cent in the next year. They indicated that their labour productivity has risen 10 per cent since October 1993, with total factor productivity up by four per cent in the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ABS's Australian business expectations survey for the March quarter this year shows clear confidence in an improved trading performance, with 74 per cent of businesses expecting increased sales and 69 per cent expecting higher profits than over the previous 12 months. The expected aggregate rise in profits is 20 per cent, with higher than average rises expected for medium sized firms and in the transport, storage and communications, construction, wholesale and manufacturing sectors&mdash;a very bullish expectation of profits.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Australia Bank's quarterly business survey reported expected business conditions, as reflected in the NAB's composite index based on trading conditions, profitability and employment for the June quarter 1994. They are at the highest level since the index was first compiled  in September 1989. So we have a convergence of business confidence, business profitability and increased employment which no doubt underpinned what the chairman of the BCA's economic committee, Ian Salmon, said just this week:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have got low inflation rate, no signs at this stage that that is going to increase dramatically. Most of the settings in the economy don't seem to have changed a great deal. There are not excessive pressures that we can determine that would normally lead to an increase in interest rates.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="JX4">Senator MINCHIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer the minister to the report in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> headed `Australia's performance is one of the worst' which shows, in effect, that Australia's real interest rates are already among the highest in the world. Is this not a reflection of this government's mismanagement of the economy and its boom-bust approach to fiscal and monetary policy? Is the government now prepared to accept the need to revise its budgetary settings to avoid further interest rate rises which will only hurt home owners and businesses?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, it is, of course, the case that Australian interest rates have been coming off a comparatively high base as against the rest of the world. That has been frankly acknowledged by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. That makes all the more surprising the current passion in some sectors of the bond market to push those rates up higher in a domestic environment where&mdash;as we keep on saying and as I have been saying all week&mdash;the fundamentals simply do not justify that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to our responding in a boom-bust cyclical way, of course that is not the case. We have broken the back of all the major problems that have traditionally plagued the Australian economy&mdash;particularly those cyclical boom-bust ones&mdash;by the fight that we embarked on throughout the 1980s. At the same time that we were changing the micro-economic environment, we systematically reduced the underlying structural deficit of the budget and put ourselves in a position where we could get budgetary outcomes&mdash;notwithstanding the recessionary impact of extra outlays that obviously threw that off course for some little time&mdash;in the medium term which will be better and more responsible and more soundly based than any other comparable economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I gave the figures yesterday about where we will be in 1996-97 as a result of our medium-term fiscal deficit strategy by comparison with where the United States, Canada, Britain and all the other traditional mainstream developed OECD economies will be. We are perfectly well positioned to take advantage of all the known characteristics of the Australian economy, the regional economy and the world economy over the next few years to produce that result without any further fiscal change.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, compare that with the kind of fiscal irresponsibility that is coming out of every orifice and every pore of the opposition's major spokespersons. The opposition has committed itself to $8 billion worth of deficit in the years ahead. It has committed itself through Mr Downer's commitments on indirect taxes and their impact on exporters. It has committed itself through the commitments by Mr Downer and Mr Costello in the area of capital gains and FBT. It has committed itself in the area of extra tax incentives for savings. It has committed itself in the area of health through Mrs Bishop. It has committed itself in the area of Aboriginal health and services&mdash;</PARA>

If the point that is being made in the very explicit terms of the question itself is that the government's fiscal policy is putting interest rates under further pressure, then it is perfectly reasonable for the government in reply not only to point to our own economic responsibility and fiscal and monetary management but also to make the point that the kind of economic vandalism of the opposition's fiscal policy would put interest rates and the Governor of the Reserve Bank under infinitely more pressure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I rise on the same point of order. I would think that if one took an extract of the number of points of order and how many of them were related to the so-called point of order of relevance, the point of order of relevance would lead the pack by a large margin. Issues of relevance have been ruled on consistently almost every question time for the last six or eight months. What we are witnessing in this chamber is points of order being called on relevance which the callers of those points of order know are vacuous, have no content and are used simply to disrupt the proceedings of this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Deputy President, it is appropriate for you, might I suggest, to sit down people who call points of order simply to disrupt the smooth flowing of this chamber. We have had a couple of examples of that this morning. It is simply an attempt to disrupt and create the type of behaviour we are now witnessing from the opposition, which is unruly and disruptive, and goes to the ability of the chair to control this chamber. I suggest that you should dismiss not only this point of order but also subsequent points of order on this ground.</PARA>

Senator Cook, in the event that points of order are taken on the basis of a debating point, they will be ruled disorderly by me as long as I am in this chair. In respect of Senator Alston's matter, I will not judge the virtue of questions or answers. They are either in order or out of order, and I will not reflect upon either the answer or the question. In respect of Senator Evans's response, he was certainly, in my view, in order with respect to relevance, but if any minister trespasses on opposition policies, past, present or in anticipation of the future, the answer will be ruled to be out of order.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have a micro-economy which is pounding along with a reform process that is further advanced than has ever been the case previously in this country. We have a trading environment which is going gangbusters as a result of the growth rates in our region and the reconstruction of the Australian economy to respond effectively to that. We have an industrial relations climate which is more cooperative than it has been for decades and an environment where there is no wage push pressure on inflation at all.

As the Senate would know, the government is currently putting a lot of effort into developing trade and investment with the dynamic economies of South East Asia, as we should be. As most would know, our exports to South East Asia are now greater than our exports either to the United States or to the European Union. So quite clearly it is the priority markets to which we should be looking.

Recognising that not all of the extra will come from sawmill waste, might we assume that the coupes agreed to last year could have been deliberately larger than required by the quota in order to approve subsequently through the backdoor an increase in the Tasmanian woodchip quota to the year 2000? Finally, I ask: what will the minister do to ensure that the Tasmanian Forestry Commission complies with Australia's international obligations under the convention on biological diversity, obligations the commission is now flagrantly violating in refusing to conduct a fauna survey in Reedy Marsh in northern Tasmania.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister has not suddenly discovered this additional 200,000 tonnes. He did recently announce approval for a woodchip export licence for Gunns Ltd for 200,000 tonnes of timber. The effect of this was to increase the annual licensed maximum of hardwood chip exports to 3.1 million tonnes. The minister approved this licence on the basis that the wood to supply these woodchips would come from operations approved in December last year for operations in 1994. This will not involve the cutting of additional coupes or increases in the size of the coupes. The harvesting of coupes to provide sawlog material, despite the contentions of Senator Bell, does produce wood suitable for the production of woodchips to this amount. A surplus of this wood exists, which, if it were not used as woodchip, would otherwise be wasted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The contention of Senator Bell that the size of the coupes approved last year was deliberately larger than required is not correct. The size of the coupes is established by the Tasmanian Forestry Commission, taking into account a range of forest management and conservation requirements. In many cases, the size of the coupes is established several years before approval is sought for the export of woodchips from those coupes. In relation to logging in Reedy Marsh, or anywhere else in Tasmania, it is an absolute requirement of Tasmania's forest practices code that pre-logging surveys including fauna are conducted.</PARA>

The research school brings together elements of the Research School of Physical Sciences and Engineering and the Centre for Information Science Research. It will work closely with the government's cooperative research centres to ensure significant interactions between this research at university level and Australian industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Information science and engineering embrace technologies that underpin many key economic activities in this country. Information technology and advanced communications seem to pervade just about every aspect of Australia's life. Information products and services alone now account for about 20 per cent of world trade and are growing steadily at about 10 per cent per annum, well ahead of the average growth in world trade in other products. As a consequence, this government recognises that these industries are critical to our economic future not only in their own right but also as a key source of enabling technologies for other industries. We are determined to see that Australia will not be left behind in the process of this important sector in the world.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the government first came to power in the early 1980s, information technology and telecommunications imports into Australia were quite high. We have since turned the situation around to a large extent and we are a now major exporter in this field of technology. We have set about encouraging a robust and locally competitive industry. In 1987, the government launched its information industry strategy. This is a strategy which has guided the rapid development of our information technology and telecommunications systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through the partnerships for development program and the fixed-term arrangement programs, the government has encouraged numerous Australian firms, that would not otherwise have had the opportunity, to forge strong alliances with international companies. To mention some of them, Nortel and Exicom have got together under this program, as have Nokia and ERG, UNISYS and Mincom, and IBM and Aspect Computing. These are Australian firms partnering with international companies which play the Australian companies into this important area of technology and export growth to give them a foothold in the world market.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The key aim of these programs is to encourage international information technology and telecommunications firms to undertake strategic arrangements in Australia, and both programs have been very successful to this point. Many major companies now have some form of strategic investment in Australia&mdash;be it in manufacturing, research and development, or in oversighting regional technical training and marketing operations. These companies have expanded and strengthened their long-term commitment to Australia.</PARA>

In 1988, those exports were valued at $A170 million, but in 1993 they were valued at $A1.2 billion and the trade deficit in this sector has been stabilised. In the same period, local research and development spending by international companies has increased by a factor of five. The industry is now confident that it can treble in size by the year 2000 and become one of the nation's biggest employment and export sectors. The inauguration of this particular research centre is critical and catalytic in that development.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the authors of these articles had made the effort to look at the facts&mdash;and the facts were always available to them on offer from the department, had it been contacted&mdash;they would know that in the financial year to date, for example, departmental officers have had an estimated one million contacts with the public on consular and passport matters.

I suspect he would be the first to criticise if a decrease in passport security led to the ease of movement of drug traffickers, criminals and terrorists being facilitated. There are stringent requirements, of course, for proof of identity and citizenship in passport issue, but these have not prevented the issue of 700,000 passports in Australia and 39,000 overseas this financial year alone, and another 4,300 which were replaced due to loss or theft. Clearly the author of these articles is also unaware of the department's service in providing emergency or compassionate passports in only a matter of hours if the occasion demands.</PARA>

A similar toll-free line is established during crises which may involve many Australians. Most recently, for example, we responded to more than 6,000 inquiries from families and friends after the Los Angeles earthquake. We have a very firm policy that Australians overseas receive the fullest assistance in times of difficulty and I think the figures speak for themselves. Certainly my own correspondence does: I got 81 letters on consular matters in the last financial year, of which only six were matters of complaint and a great many were rave reviews for the quality of the personal attention and assistance received from our officers.</PARA>

Occasionally, of course, the case load means that performance may not be as perfect as we would wish. Sometimes something goes wrong.

I have the greatest sympathy for the distress that relatives go through in these situations, but when someone disappears without there being any clear information about the time or location, there is only a certain amount we can do to persuade host governments in other countries to mount full-scale search operations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. How accurate are media reports which suggest that Australia's ambassador to Burma, Mr Stuart Hume, recently stated that Burma's forced labour practices are acceptable and that Australia was ready to assist Burma with technical and financial assistance for border area development?  Was Mr Hume speaking on behalf of the Australian government when he made these comments? Finally, if these comments were made but not authorised in any way, has the government considered recalling the ambassador so that he might become more acquainted with the facts surrounding Burma's military regime?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first remarks attributed to the ambassador by some groups in the Australian NGO community, namely, that Ambassador Hume is supposed to have said that forced labour in Burma is a matter of culture and is therefore okay, my understanding is that during a conversation Ambassador Hume had in Bangkok in April he offered the historical observation that corvee labour has been a longstanding practice in Burma since 1962. Certainly his comments were not intended to condone this objectionable practice. Certainly they would not be condoned by the Australian government. I think there has simply been a misunderstanding or a misreporting of what he actually said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the other suggestion that the Australian ambassador had conveyed a proposal to Burma's Minister for Border Area Development, Lieutenant General Maung Thint, that an Australian NGO help Burma's military authorities develop the country's border areas, these reports are simply inaccurate. What happened was this: in the context of an introductory call on Maung Thint on 17 June the ambassador asked the minister whether as a matter of general principle non-government organisations would be allowed to work in the country's border areas. Lieutenant General Maung Thint replied in the affirmative.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ambassador's question was entirely consistent with the government's position that any humanitarian assistance to the people of Burma should be directed to the areas of greatest need. It is generally agreed that while humanitarian problems exist throughout Burma there are particular needs in the Thai-Burma border region. This follows requests from the Kachin community&mdash;which has recently concluded, as Senator Bourne would know, a cease-fire agreement with the SLORC&mdash;that the international community provide some form of assistance to Kachin state in the north of the country to alleviate the serious humanitarian problems that exist there. Whether any projects eventuate in Kachin state or whether any other area in the border region develops such projects will depend on whether any Australian NGO puts them forward.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is concerned at reports of continuing human rights abuse, including forced labour, in the border regions. There is no suggestion that Australian NGOs would be involved in the border development activities undertaken by the SLORC itself. I say finally that Ambassador Hume took the opportunity at his meeting with the minister to encourage the SLORC to work towards a genuine and comprehensive national reconciliation with both ethnic insurgents and the domestic political opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week the Construction Industry Development Agency held a major conference in Brisbane attended by nearly 500 representatives of the Australian building industry, government, unions and employers. One of the major matters for discussion was the future of CIDA, the Construction Industry Development Agency, which was established in 1991 as a tripartite arrangement funded by the Australian government but with the support of the construction industry. When it was established, a sunset clause of June next year was included. It was always the view of the government, and it still is, that the industry has to take charge of its own reform process after the government has given it its initial start. That was the view discussed at the conference. One of the major themes of the conference was around that particular issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What came out of the discussion was that most of the industry believes that there has to be a continuing reform process, but it should not be run by the government. The industry council will be holding a meeting later this year. At that we hope to have key options put before it about how the reform process should continue, so that well before the sunset clause of June of next year the industry itself knows about its own future.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I point out to the Senate that since 1991 the CIDA process has been extremely successful in showing that there are ways in which this industry, despite its long history of conflict, can achieve outstanding success. There have been a number of major construction projects in Australia under this process that have been brought in under budget under time, such as the nearly completed third runway project in Sydney, the Glebe Island bridge and the Stanwell electricity power plant in central Queensland. All have been brought to fruition because both employers and employees have worked together to carry out reform on the labour side, including the introduction of multiskilling, building regulations and general improvement in the running of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry generates about $40 billion worth of turnover, or about 10 per cent of GDP. This is a very important development which will result in major improvements in cost structure and in skill levels. We hope we can make a major effort in exporting these skills through the recently announced Asian infrastructure initiative whereby Australian companies will be encouraged to form consortiums to go into Asia and be more successful in winning the major infrastructure developments in that region. So it was a very successful conference. It was pleasing to see both employers' and employees' representatives realising that the reform process must continue. They are committed to it.</PARA>

I appreciated Senator Campbell's comments and took them on board. I did not seek to respond at the time. Those comments went to the question of whether, after speaking in a debate, a senator should stay for the reply.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today Senator Abetz has come into this chamber and attacked me and Senator Carr without any notification of that fact. He has made quite scandalous allegations about our contributions to the debate, which he did not stay for. He also chose not to forewarn us that he was going to raise this issue again today. I suggest that Senator Abetz ought to take a lesson from Senator Campbell, who is an expert on such matters. He has given me very useful advice on the etiquette required in the Senate. I am happy to say that I have taken on board Senator Campbell's advice. I also got a lecture from the Deputy President at one stage about such courtesy. I think the Liberal Party would do well to train its new senators in such standards. They are clearly very sensitive chaps. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Abetz has been very sensitive about the allegations and the whole debate with respect to this matter. The hypocrisy he has shown in the debate has been quite outstanding. This is the same senator who questioned witnesses at the estimates committee about whether they had any relationships with people who are members of the ACTU. He wanted to know whether public servants were related in any way, shape or form&mdash;whether by marriage or by any other form of relationship&mdash;to members of the ACTU. He thought that was an important issue which he had a right to inquire into. In the same breath, Senator Abetz attacked the department for providing a list of names and classifications of employees of the department to accredited trade union representatives on the basis of privacy legislation and the employees' right to keep that information private. It appears that public servants have no right to privacy in estimates committees. They have to reveal all their relatives, et cetera. </PARA>

The Prime Minister and Senator Evans, in answering these questions, continue to ignore the fact that there are a whole lot of influences on interest rates. Interest rates are basically the price of money influenced and determined by the demand and the supply. There is an enormous worldwide demand now for investment capital. As a result of the Labor Party's policies, which Senator Carr would obviously object to, we have become part of the international economy. We have supported that. We are now out there competing in the world marketplace for investment capital. That demand obviously has an enormous influence on the price of money and, therefore, interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ALP cannot have it both ways. The ALP took us into the international marketplace. It deregulated the financial markets. We now have to conduct ourselves accordingly. Those moves by the Labor government, which no doubt the Left objects to, have meant an enormous imposition of discipline on our part as a national economy. We have to get the domestic economic settings right if we want to keep interest rates down and continue to attract investment capital to Australia. That is something the Labor Party continues to ignore. That has been the problem over its 11 years of government. It has sought to take us into the international economy but has not done what is required with the domestic economy to ensure that we can survive in that international marketplace and have interest rate settings which will not damage home owners, small businesses and everybody else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are several things which the government simply has to do and which it has not done to ensure that the domestic economic settings are right in the international environment of a worldwide demand for investment capital, particularly with the booming Asian economies. As Max Walsh said the other day, there is a capital squeeze out there because of the enormous demand for capital. That is driving up interest rates and imposing the discipline on the Australian economy that this government is failing to provide. It means that we must improve the productivity of the Australian economy. That is not being done sufficiently fast by this government. It is tied to the ACTU. It is simply failing to respond by freeing up the labour market in ways that will increase our productivity and, therefore, make us an attractive place in which to invest money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Industrial Relations Act is an absolute disgrace to the Australian nation in preventing us from doing what is required to improve the productivity of this country and increase our living standards. The new act is a direct attack on the living standards of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are to compete in the international marketplace for capital without having high interest rates, we have to save more. As the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> said in its editorial this morning about the government, `It should increase public sector saving more quickly by cutting the federal budget deficit harder.' That is the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS>, an independent newspaper, saying that. It is not us; it is the most eminent financial paper in this country, saying that the federal government has to act on the deficit. It has been totally irresponsible. Its performance on its budget has been hopeless. We have to save more if we are to keep our interest rates down and prevent the damage that is about to be done to home owners and small businesses by this government's irresponsible budgetary policies. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I wish to make a personal explanation. Some comment was made earlier in the debate by Senator Chris Evans concerning my absenting myself from debate on a matter of public importance that I had raised in the Senate yesterday. I did absent myself for a very brief period during the debate. The reason for that was that I had been given a note indicating a potentially serious family matter. I therefore had to briefly absent myself from the chamber to telephone my eight-months pregnant wife and arrange a potential air flight back to Tasmania in the event that that was necessary. I am thankful to say that I did not have to leave immediately. I can assure the Senate that my family will always come before any debate in this chamber and any contribution Senator Evans might be making at the time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to the Meat Inspection (Fees) Orders, Meat Inspection Orders No 1 of 1994, considered by the Committee at its meeting of 5 May 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advises that the Orders will result in total fees being reduced by $0.3 million dollars in a full financial year. The Committee welcomes this reduction and would appreciate your advice on whether the new fees are based on full or partial cost recovery, or on some other basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More importantly, the Secretary is given a number of discretions which are commercially valuable. These include the power to extend the time for payment of an unpaid fee or late payment penalty, to allow an unpaid fee or late payment penalty to be paid by instalments (paragraph 24.1), to direct that inspection services must not be provided if fees or penalties are unpaid (paragraph 28.2) and to remit some or all of a fee or late payment penalty in special circumstances (paragraph 29.1).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraphs 30 and 31 provide for reconsideration of decisions by the Secretary and for review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This right of review, however, does not extend to reconsidered decisions made under paragraphs 24.1 or 29.1(a), which may be the most commercially valuable decisions. The Committee asks why these decisions have been excluded from AAT review, while a possibly less important decision is subject to review. The Committee suggests that it may be appropriate to amend the Orders to provide for AAT review of paragraphs 24.1 and 29.1(a).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your Chairman's letters of 6 May 1994 regarding recent amendments to the Meat Inspection (Fees) Orders and the Export Control (Fees) Orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reductions in charges imposed under the orders are a consequence of the introduction of a revised two-tiered charging structure for meat inspection services provided by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the revised charging structure direct inspection/field costs will be recovered through reduced "fee for service" charges imposed according to inspector usage.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Non-field costs, including the certification of meat for export, maintenance of overseas country listings, technical reviews, industry liaison, financial, accounting, auditing, training and personnel services, will be recovered through new registration charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The introduction of a two-tiered charging system is a key part of the reform process for AQIS announced in August 1993. Revenue from the meat inspection program is capped at the 1992/93 level of $80.6m in the current financial year, reducing to $70.5m by 1996/97.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new fee structure is based on the principle of full cost recovery. However, due to a phasing in of the registration component of the charge, full cost recovery will not be achieved until 1995/96.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee has enquired why certain decisions are excluded from Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT) review. If provision were made in the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations which would allow recourse to the AAT for review of such cases, there would be scope for exploitation by persons seeking only to delay payment by this means. Any person aggrieved by a decision under the Regulations could seek review of the decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As AQIS operates on a full cost recovery basis, failure to recover its attributable costs would mean, ultimately, that these would need to be recovered from other clients or funded through the budget process.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for your letter of 12 May 1994 concerning an amendment made to the Migration (1993) Regulations by subregulation 21.1 of Statutory Rules 1994 No 38. Your reference is Cttee/668.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You have asked for my views as to whether the power to designate countries for the purposes of clause 9234 of Schedule 9 is legally valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am advised that clause 9234 is legally valid. Subsection 181(1A) of the Migration Act 1958 expressly provides that section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 does not prevent the making of regulations whose operation depends on a country or other matter being specified or certified by the Minister in a notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> after the taking effect of the regulations. Regulation 1.16 provides that the Minister may, by notice published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS>, specify matters required by individual provisions of the Regulations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I note your concern that clause 9234 may be legislative in nature, and your question whether any <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> notices should be tabled and subject to possible disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the provision is to require that holders of visitor visas and entry permits who are over 16 years and intend to study in class-rooms in Australia for more than four weeks must pass a chest X-ray examination unless they are from a country with a low incidence of TB. The object is to protect students in the class-room environment from the possibility of contracting TB through contact with an infected person. The countries designated in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> notice are countries in which the incidence of TB is known to be low. Visitors from those countries who intend to study do not have to undergo a chest X-ray as the risk of their being infected is minimal. My Department is advised by the Australian Government Health Service regarding countries which may appropriately be designated as low TB risk countries. The list of low risk countries is constantly monitored and may require changes at short notice. The countries are designated by <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> notice rather than in the Regulations as this allows changes to be made more quickly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Subject to your further views, I would be prepared to consider proposing that the Governor-General-in-Council make an amendment to clause 9234 to make the purpose of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> notice clear.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In view of the nature of subsection 181(1A) of the Act, I do not propose an amendment to provide for the tabling and disallowance of any <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Gazette</EMPHASIS> notices that may be made under the regulation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutory Rules 1994 Nos 64 and 66 reduce a number of charges by half. Some of these reductions are quite substantial. For instance, one charge of $45,040 becomes $22,520 and another of $35,385 becomes $17,685. The Committee welcomes these changes, but would appreciate your advice on the reasons for the reductions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutory Rules 1994 No 65, among other things, provide for the Secretary to defer payment of charges or instalments of charges and, in specified circumstances, to refund or remit charges. The Committee would appreciate your advice on whether these important discretions are subject to AAT review. If not, the Committee would be grateful if you could confirm that the exclusions are within the relevant guidelines of the Administrative Review Council. Also, the Explanatory Statement advises that the discretions may be exercised by a delegate of the Secretary. The Committee would be grateful if you could advise of the circumstances in which these powers would be exercised by a delegate and of the persons to whom delegations will be made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Orders 139A.2(b) and 139A.3(c) of the Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994 provide respectively for the Secretary to declare foreign countries for the purposes of the Orders and to approve a system to indicate that an animal has not been treated with HGP. These powers appear to be legislative.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">CANBERRA ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Thank you for letter of 12 May 1994 raising four matters of concern to the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances relating to Statutory Rules Nos 64, 65 and 66 and Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994. These amend, respectively, the Export Inspection and Meat (Establishment Registration Charges) Regulations, the Export Inspection and Meat Charges and Collection Regulations, the Domestic Meat Premises Charge Regulations and the Export Meat Orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee has asked why certain charges in regard to export meat establishments and domestic meat premises have been reduced under Statutory Rules No 64 and 66. AQlS's charges applying to small premises were significantly reduced from earlier proposals as an interim measure to limit their immediate impact pending the advice of a joint AQIS/industry charging review committee which will consider the most appropriate charging structures for cost recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to Statutory Rules No 65, the Standing Committee has questioned whether decisions made by the Secretary on deferment, refund or remission of charges are subject to Administrative Appeals Tribunal review. There is no express provision that would allow any of these decisions to be referred to the Tribunal for review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Decisions in regard to the collection of inspection fees or charges are not specified in the Administrative Review Council guidelines as matters excluded from Tribunal review. I understand, however, that the list of exclusions made in the guidelines is not intended to be exhaustive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If provision were made in the Export Inspection and Meat Charges Collection Regulations which would allow recourse to the AAT for review of such cases, there would be scope for exploitation by persons seeking only to delay payment by this means. Any person aggrieved by a decision under the Regulations could seek review of the decision under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review Act) 1977.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As AQIS operates on a full cost recovery basis, failure to recover its attributable costs would mean, ultimately, that these would need to be recovered from other clients or funded through the budget process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For these reasons I believe review by the Tribunal would be inappropriate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Standing Committee has requested details of the circumstances in which the discretionary powers made in Statutory Rules No 65 in regard to deferment, refund or remission of charges would be exercised by a delegate of the Secretary and of the persons to whom such delegations will be made. I am advised that all the discretionary powers are to be delegated and the delegated powers will reside with the occupants of a small number of AQIS Senior Executive Service positions in Canberra.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994, the Standing Committee has indicated that paragraphs 139A.2(b) and 139A.3(c) appear to confer powers that are legislative. AQIS has now obtained advice from the Office of General Counsel, Attorney-General's Department regarding the validity of suborders 139A.1, 139A.2 and 139A.3 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Meat Orders</EMPHASIS> and a copy is enclosed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice indicates neither paragraph 139A.2(b) nor 139A.3(c) constitute an unlawful delegation of legislative power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Export Control Orders No 2 of 1994 amend provisions in the Export Meat Orders on national controls on the slaughter of animals treated with hormonal growth promotants (HGPs). The national controls are of major importance to Australia as some countries such as the members of the European Union (EU) have placed bans on the use of HGPs and on meat derived from treated animals. Following a review of these controls by EU officials, it became necessary for the controls to be strengthened if Australia was to retain access to these markets. The means of strengthening the controls was agreed to through the work of a joint industry/State/AQIS working party. The draft amendment was widely canvassed and has the support of both industry and the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment serves to bring into effect the necessary changes to Commonwealth legislation. It also provides the administrative flexibility essential for the controls to work by providing discretionary powers, including those provided by paragraphs 139A.2(b) and 139A.3(c).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 139A.2(b) allows for the declaration of countries other than those specified under order 452 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Export Meat Orders</EMPHASIS>. Order 452 calls up an AQIS publication Volume 2 of the "Australian Export Meat Manual" entitled "Requirement for Overseas Countries". Volume 2 details those requirements essential for meat to enter a given country. Paragraph 139A.2(b) provides a mechanism to put in place new importing country requirements immediately they become effective in anticipation of a later formal amendment to the entry for that country in the manual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Paragraph 139A.3(c) serves to accommodate the variation in national controls as applied at the State level. States have, to a varying extent, developed their own control arrangements reflecting existing legislative powers and available resources. It is not practical to legislate precisely for each State system in place, or that could be put in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Accordingly, paragraph 139A.3(c) provides for the various forms that the declaration furnished by the occupier may take, namely by means of a written statement using an approved form, by means of an identification tag attached to the animal itself or by another means as may be necessary to approve from time to time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a new system of national controls were to be implemented, that system would be the subject of an amendment to the Orders in accordance with established practice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will detain the Senate very briefly. I simply want to continue the comments that I was prevented from making in last night's adjournment debate by Senator Ian Macdonald's urgency to comment on the issue. The issue is the Hinchinbrook development and the grave concerns that have been expressed at the community level in Townsville and also in this chamber by various senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to honourable senators the document that I tabled yesterday, which is a brief that has been put together by the North Queensland Conservation Council. It contains an excellent summary of the environmental concerns that have caused the local community and the environment movement to press for a reconsideration of the approval to let this development go ahead. Because that contains a very explicit and ample account of environmental concerns, I will not go over the matters mentioned in the document. However, I would mention that the document also contains a copy of the submission of the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Sport and Territories to the Queensland Office of the Co-ordinator General, in which it was made quite clear that there are very serious environmental concerns that are required to be addressed before this proposal goes ahead. I also commend that submission to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I wish to raise is the lack of consultation of Aboriginal people with regard to this development at Oyster Point. People may not be aware that this unique and ancient area, where World Heritage values have been noted, is just outside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority area. Aboriginal people and local people are still using 1,500-year-old fish traps which are so well designed they allow for the catching and the maintenance of the marine life without disruption to the marine environment. The fish traps are joined together by oysters that have grown into their structure. The main beach is full of middens and stone tools which are in danger of damage from the numerous tourists going through the area. It remains a very vulnerable area. At the moment there is little capacity to police the area and make sure that camping does not occur on top of burial grounds and shell middens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is of major concern that there has been very little Aboriginal involvement in the tourist permits that have been issued. The Aboriginal people, the Bandjin people, have had no opportunity to share their thoughts on what would be appropriate and ecologically sensitive development and tourism. They would like the current development stopped and new consultations initiated to look at environmentally and culturally sensitive ways in which to allow tourists into this very valuable area. In earlier days the Bandjin people were forced from Hinchinbrook Island, which was their area. They still visit it and they still maintain a cultural contact. As a result of that, they will be making a native title claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The full extent of the involvement and the significance of the area is yet to be determined. That is a very important reason why development should not go ahead. I think that more and more information will emerge. The difficulty is that, because the Queensland state government has given approval for this development, it is likely that damaging construction work will occur prior to the completion of the independent assessment of how the development will affect world heritage values of the area, which was requested by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner). It is very important that the Senate realise that the development must not go ahead before proper investigation is made into it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the federal minister for the environment to instigate a full inquiry into the proposed Port Hinchinbrook Oyster Point development in North Queensland. We certainly welcome his request for an independent assessment. It is certainly appropriate. However, it is not enough to protect the values of this area or to do justice to the Aboriginal people who, for many hundreds and hundreds of years, have occupied this area and who as yet have not been heard adequately in relation to how this development will impact on their land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Most reasonable people would think that by the time one had turned 90 years of age, one would be able to live life peacefully without having to go to a local senator to get redress of a matter. I raise this matter this morning, which was brought to me by the son of the woman concerned, in the hope that I can attract the attention of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca), who has not yet replied to the letter I wrote to him on 20 May this year pointing out what had occurred. I shall tell the Senate this story as briefly as I can. My constituent is a war widow and lives in a retirement hostel in Canberra and, as I said, is over 90 years of age. This is a matter for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs as this woman, being a war widow, has certain entitlements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May of last year she was told by her doctor that she needed a specially made pair of shoes because of her difficulties. She put in the appropriate application to the department for the shoes to which she would be entitled. When she received the shoes, they did not fit. They were returned to the maker to be refitted and stretched, or to have something done to enable her to wear them. When the shoes came back, they still did not fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor then suggested that it would be in her interests to have a pair of sports shoes&mdash;running shoes with a soft sole. He felt that might make it easier for her to overcome her difficulty in getting a pair of shoes made to fit her comfortably. So an application was made to the Department of Veterans' Affairs for a pair of sports shoes. She was advised to return the other pair of shoes for refitting and repair. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The doctor said that the shoes made for her were still totally unsatisfactory and repeated his suggestion that she would be better off with a pair of sports shoes. Of course, sports shoes would be the cheaper option. The custom-made orthopaedic shoes would cost about $300, or even more if they needed to be adjusted several times while the sports shoes are in the vicinity of $90 to $120, much cheaper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date, the shoes which she cannot wear have been refitted four times, all of them unsuccessful, but the department still will not purchase for her, or provide the funding for, a pair of sports shoes which she could be fitted with quite easily and wear comfortably. As a result, she has had to wear slippers. Slippers have their place in life. At times, nothing is more comfortable than a pair of slippers, especially when they go with a nice open fire. But I believe it is very demoralising and depressing to have to wear slippers all the time, which she should not have to do because it is not necessary. She would be comfortable in a pair of sports shoes, would have more self-respect and feel better dressed but she has been forced to choose between a totally uncomfortable pair of shoes, if she wants to be dressed in that fashion, and slippers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, on 20 May I wrote to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs telling him that I regarded the story as unacceptable. I asked him to personally look into the matter, as I believe it is a matter of urgency, certainly for my constituent. So far I have not had any response. After checking this morning with my constituent, I find she still does not have appropriate shoes to which she is entitled as a war widow. Perhaps the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Resources (Senator Sherry), who is present in the chamber, will take up the matter with the minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that he sees it is a matter of urgency and will urge the minister to see it likewise, The minister should use his discretion to say to the department, `Get this woman a pair of appropriately fitting sports shoes within a week.' This matter would then be resolved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) &amp; (2) Listing in the Register of the National Estate does not, in any way, constitute a limitation on the access, use or enjoyment of listed land over and above any such restrictions that may already have been put in place by the State Government. The Australian Heritage Commission does not have the powers to impose any of the constraints referred to above and the Federal Government has no plans to introduce any other processes to that effect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Australian Heritage Commission records indicate that the AHC did, in fact, advise the Council in advance of its intention to interim-list places in the Southern Forest Region. A letter of notification about the intended listings was sent to the Shire of Manjimup, dated 8 February 1994. The Commission, in conjunction with CALM, also held a public meeting, as early as February 1992, to inform the local community about the regional assessment project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The area in question was originally nominated for entry in the Register by the WA Government and registered in 1978 as part of the `Proposed South Coast National Park' without any limitations having been placed on the management or use of this land in that time. The home-owners resident in the area were not identified in the data on private landowners obtained from the Department of Conservation and Land Management and the statutory obligation of the Commission to provide a notice of intention to enter a place in the Register does not apply to those places that have already been listed in the past&mdash;as was Windy Harbour in 1978.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The heritage listing model was not ratified by the model committee as the agreement to develop the model was made between the AHC and the Western Australian Farmers' Federation. The final model was endorsed by both WAFF and the National Farmers' Federation. The role of the Heritage Model Committee was to provide local input as required. I provide the honourable senator with a brief background to the series of events which led to this outcome.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In March 1992, the Western Australian Farmers' Federation and the Australian Heritage Commission entered into an agreement that:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">before any further assessment of private properties, the AHC and WAFF, in consultation with landowner representatives, would work to develop a model for future listings of farmland.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">the AHC and WAFF would progress this model which would be the preferred model for listings of farmland in WA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A version of the model was requested at a public meeting in June 1993, by members of both the local community and the Heritage Model Committee, which made provision for the right of private landowners to veto any proposed recognition of national estate values. The question of veto had been extensively explored by the Heritage Model Committee prior to this meeting, including seeking the advice of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department. It was made clear at that time that such a proviso would run counter to the Commission's statutory obligations and past practices as defined in its Act. The power of veto for the protection of individual rights should not be considered a pre-requisite for community involvement in the identification of the National Estate, since there is no question of listing infringing such rights.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Notwithstanding this clear advice, the model, as proposed at the public meeting, was presented for consideration at the 98th meeting of the Australian Heritage Commission on 26-27 August 1993. The Commission considered the veto proposal at length&mdash;along with the Attorney-General's Department advice on the matter&mdash;and determined that the power of veto by an individual property owner was not within the purview of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. It did, however, endorse a model for community participation that was consistent with its obligations under this Act. The Commission and WAFF agreed that the endorsed model was in line with their joint agreement of March 1992. This model was, subsequently, also endorsed by the National Farmers' Federation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) The Australian Heritage Commission did not ignore the suggested power of veto over listing which was requested by members of the Heritage Model Committee. After due consideration of this request and having sought the legal advice of the Commonwealth Attorney-General's Department, the Chairman and Commissioners of the AHC determined that the adoption of the veto proposal would be contrary to the statutory requirements imposed by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Heritage Model Committee established two models. One for future regional assessments and one for the Southern Forests project. This was done in recognition of the fact that it was not possible to apply the former model retrospectively in the Southern Forest Region and that subsequent assessments would involve the community more fully. The latter model, which was devised to take into account the Commission's community participation program over the past eighteen months, has been adhered to.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The Australian Heritage Commission has a statutory obligation to allow for a minimum three-month objection period following the interim-listing of places on the Register of the National Estate. The 9 June 1994 deadline is in accordance with that obligation as it will be three months since the public notification of the interim-listings was announced on 8 March 1994. The Commission, however, is prepared to consider detailed submissions beyond the 9 June deadline if the nature of any objections received by that date requires it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(9) Windy Harbour was originally registered in 1978 as part of the then `Proposed South Coast National Park' whose boundaries were those recommended by State Cabinet in 1976. The area was then nominated for national estate listing by the State Government and entered in the Register without objection. The recent joint AHC/CALM regional assessment identified a range of national estate values across the D'Entrecasteaux area including Windy Harbour.</PARA>
